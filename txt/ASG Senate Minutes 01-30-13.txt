ASG Senate Minutes
01-30-13

I. Executive Board Reports
	•	Victor: JPK coming into ASG exec on Sunday to talk about various projects
	•	Brad: NU Night at the United Center Update- Bulls set ticket price of $55 a ticket. Given that Derrick Rose's return is impending, they won't give us lower price. Still working with the Bulls, but generally doesn't think that using $20,000 of student groups money would be advisable to spend when students would still have to pay $30 to $40 dollars. Also, I put some cool submissions to Campus Voice in my exec board report- check it out.
	•	Rebecca (question): Can we just go ourselves? Like just ASG?
	•	David H: Who studied abroad in the fall? You should've gotten an email from the study abroad office. We need student support to make the site a success.
	•	Mark (question): Reason for using word doc?
	•	David: Tried various things, wanted something people could download and take their time with. Figured it'd be easier on both sides.
	•	David: Also, Food Truck festival coming up, some proceeds donated to DM. Look at my report for more updates
	•	Carly: Operations is live! Had a frustrating meeting with RHA and will be collaborating with ResLife and CAs in the future for dorm elections and Senator replacements. Want to recognize Dorm Conditions Working group members as the Senators of the week!
	•	Alex: New Norris executive Director started on Monday- working with her and JPK to set up Norris Advisory Committee. Also working with the Center for Civic Engagement to get more students into Chicago. Also meeting with Red Watch Band program with Alcohol Policy Working Group. Finally, just working on showing appreciation for our janitorial staff .
	•	Alex: Also, Student Life managed to get exercise classes going in PARC!
	•	Becca: In addition to food truck festival, there's "Get Fit for Sandy"
	•	Neil: Check out my exec board report.
	•	Steven: Housing Fair going according to plan and pursuing partnerships related to voter registration
	•	Girish: We'll be talking about big things in a sec, but let me know if you have any other questions
	•	Ethan: HEY EVERYBODY!! Read my exec board report
	•	Ani: Been meeting with a lot of you over the past few days- look at my exec board reports for details on that. Will also be talking about future of caucuses this weekend. Let's introduce new Senators...
	•	Luke: I'll be replacing Noah as a IFC Senator from Phi Delt.
	•	Gio: Hi- I'm replacing John as MGC Senator
 
II. Special Order: Presentation from Dr. John H. Dunkle, Executive Director, Counseling and Psychological Services
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Alex Lower: You said there's been an increase in severity and number of visits- why?
	•	Dunkle: Multiple causes- mass tragedies, economy- there's certainly a ripple effect from events like this.
	•	David H: how can student government help with outreach or support of these goals?
	•	Dunkle: Great to be able to come here and present an update- also great to be working with student government on other avenues. Also helped push for mental health essential NU.
III. General Order: SAFC Investigations
	•	Girish: We sometimes do investigations of groups that violate SAFC guidelines. We go to the group and see if they broke any rules, bring it to Senate and SAFC and see if there are grounds to hold an investigation.
	•	AATE
	•	NPHC Fall Mixer Event- money wasn't used for the event for two years
	•	College Feminists Sex Week last spring
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Alex Lower: What does this actually mean?
	•	Girish: Mainly just want to make you all aware that an investigation is happening and to look out for developments on this.
IV. General Order: Financial & Student Groups Vice Presidents Application Release
	•	Ani: Applications for Girish and Lauren's positions are available. Those applications are in the agenda and in emails I've sent out. These positions require a lot of time and work.
	•	Lauren: Girish and I's positions are appointed. We filled out an application- it's very long and time intensive, like the position. Following submission, you interview with ASG members. If you're interested in applying, I'd love to hear from you. What the SGVP does is oversee the Student Groups Committee, which oversees B and T status groups on campus. My role also includes planning a few large events like the Activities Fairs and working in tangent with Girish for Spring Leadership Training. My position is really hard, but you get to meet some really cool student group leaders and work with them on a daily basis. Really rewarding. Apps due on the 9th.
	•	Girish: A lot of the same of what Lauren described. Lauren's position is focused on building up groups and sustaining them, my committee deals with making sure groups utilize the funding we provide them and keeping them going. Feel free to ask us questions after Senate or to email us
	•	Victor: Why do A-status groups receive so much more money?
	•	Girish: Groups that have been around and been successful with large programming consistency
	•	Brad: Reach out to me if you want to run for any exec board position if you haven't already contacted the current holder of the position
V. General Order: Senator Profile Form
	•	Ani: We're building the ASG website, need your information for this, so please fill it out for Ethan.
VI. New Business: SR1213-09: Brady Scholars Senior Project: Hoop House
	•	Maeve: I'm a Senior in the Brady Scholars Program- it's a three year program where we study philosophy and then culminate in a project to address some injustice in the community.
	•	Ummul: We were divided into three groups in our class with each one proposing a project and ultimately voting on one to pursue. We spent most of junior year abroad and looking for organizations on the West side of Evanston to partner with. We decided to partner with New Leaf Urban Gardens which creates greenhouses to address economic marginalization. Right now, we want to help them expand their market and the lands they have to grow- building a hoop house on Northwestern's campus would create a partnership to have fresh produce sold to Sodexho and help provide more jobs to Evanston. We've been meeting with various administrators to work out logistics and see where such a structure could be built on campus. Looking at two different locations, including near Plex, or near Norris
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian: Where do you think it will go up?
	•	Maeve: Either Plex lawn or at Norris in conjunction with WildRoots.
	•	Michelle: How do you see fruits provided here helping?
	•	Ummul: NULG would be able to hire more people and make a higher profit to support the workers it's hiring.
	•	Lauren: Timeline for getting everything built/done?
	•	Maeve: By this Spring hopefully- shouldn't be too hard, most of the work lies in making sure it's sustainable after we graduate
	•	Petros: How large is it and how can you make sure it won't get vandalized?
	•	Should be 20 x 60 feet, and we should have staff from NLUG  to hopefully prevent vandalism.
	•	Patrick: How much annual revenue do you expect?
	•	Ummul: Still working that out, it's very based on how much they can grow and exactly what is grown. They grew like 20 tons of tomatoes before...
	•	Patrick: I come from a family of tomato farmers (no joke), and that seems like a lot of tomatoes.
	•	Ummul: We're working with Brady Scholar grad students who are working out more logistics related to this.
	•	Ani: This is new business, we'll vote on it as old business next week.
	•	Steven: Motion to bump up SR1213-08 to the top of the agenda, since it affects other legislation on the docket.
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is moved to the top of the agenda.
VII. Old Business: SR1213-08: Political and Partisan Issues
	•	Rebecca: You know this legislation and probably how you're going to vote on it already. I think this legislation is important and it's important to think about as we make decisions and how we conduct ourselves as Senators representing our constituents
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Petros: Who gets to decide what is and isn't related to students?
	•	Rebecca: You all do- when a piece of resolution comes up that touches on a touchy topic, this resolution states you need to take a step back and think about if your marginalizing part of the community.
	•	Brad (Point of Information): Resolutions are binding, just don't advocate action.
	•	Ian: Is a code change in order to address this?
	•	Rebecca: Something to look at in the future, but this can certainly exist without a code change
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con on the legislation.
	•	Ian (con): I think based on what the author is saying on the legislation, it's saying we should take a step back and look if we be seeing it. This does nothing- we need a code change for any real change. By passing a resolution that we hold ourselves to a certain standard is circular and complicates things for Senators down the road.
	•	Mike (con): This resolution is great and reminds us that we a re diverse group of students. We all represent the students, but at the same time, it's ambiguous in it's scope and could complicate simple issues down the road. We should trash this and consider each resolution on a case by case basis. Every time we pass a resolution, there will be people against it and we just have to deal with this
	•	Harrison: Motion to table this legislation for three weeks.
	•	Senators: Multiple objections
	•	Harrison: I'm an author on this bill, you can probably guess that there's a reason I want to table it for a time instead of for forever . This bill can go somewhere if we think about it more deeply- it's clearly an issue on campus. Three weeks would give us time to rehash through this and provide a better piece of legislation that reflects what students want.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Steven: Are there any potential amendments that could be brought to the table tonight?
	•	Harrison: haven't thought through a lot of amendments and wasn't sure how this bill would be perceived. Now I see how it is perceived- we want to work on this.
	•	Mike: Question respectfully withdrawn
	•	Mark: Can you elaborate further on the relevance of the Daily Northwestern poll?
	•	Harrison: You can look at it now, it represents a roughly 5% sample of the Northwestern student body. Half the student body supports that ASG shouldn't be taking action on this
	•	Katie: This is just in reference to the gun control issue- not necessarily all political and partisan issues
	•	Harrison: We still have a very sizable amount of student population against action like this- enough to take a look again.
	•	McKenzie: Will you conduct further surveys to get a more accurate portrayal of campus opinion?
	•	Harrison: Definitely something we'll look into to get amore accurate picture of .
	•	Brad (point of information): 380 out of 8000 would be a statistically relevant sample, but this isn't a random sample.
	•	Petros: Do you believe that the leading questions doesn't inform the answer and if the question was asked differently it'd provide the same result?
	•	Harrison: Can't know, need time to do research like this- if we find out that we're wrong we can stop action on this.
	•	Motoki: Motion to previous question
	•	Dana: Objection
	•	Motoki: Withdrawn
	•	Steven: Would you be open to having a bit of debate before voting on whether or not to table?
	•	Harrison: Absolutely
	•	Dana: Why would a 3 week holding period be helpful?
	•	Harrison: 3 weeks would be ideal, anything less is too short, anything more would be too long. Just think there's reason to believe this bill can be improved and need time to look at it.
	•	Rebecca: Can you explain the apple analogy again?
	•	Ian (point of privilege): Needlessly insulting
	•	Harrison: Meant to distinguish between national issues and issues that affect us, and can't determine the point where issues do affect us.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con on tabling this
	•	Mike (con): I am completely against tabling this because at the core, this legislation is censorship. It's wrong, it's bad. We represent the student body and should be able to decide on a case by case basis on what should be heard. Makes Senators second guess themselves when they want to bring up resolutions about international issues. This discussion is important and this is just a political attempt to respond to the gun control.
	•	Motoki: Motion to previous question
	•	Harrison: Objection
	•	Motoki: This is a huge waste of time, my motion is also a waste of time, but come on guys, it's not a matter of how many weeks we need to table, it's not that big of a deal.
	•	Harrison: The building I represent wonders what the purpose of ASG is. I think one of the things we should be addressing as part of ASG is answering the concerns of the student body.
	•	Steven: I agree for a completely different reason, we should continue to talk about this and get some resolution on this issue before moving to a vote.
	•	Ani: Moving into a vote on whether or not to move to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. Moving to previous question.
	•	Ani: Moving into a vote on tabling this bill for three weeks
	•	Vote- fails. Legislation is not tabled for three weeks.
	•	Rebecca: Motion to table indefinitely.
	•	Mike (point of parliamentary procedure): So does this still like float around?
	•	Ani: Yes- it's in legislative purgatory.
	•	Ian: Objection
	•	Rebecca: Personally, I don't see this bill as censorship-y. Striking down this bill wouldn't send the right message, tabling this will send the message that we just don't want to talk about this right now
	•	Ani: Moving to pro/con
	•	Ian (con): The very heart and soul of this bill is so bad that we should reject it since it isn't a good bill. We can't let this go unrejected through senate
	•	Patrick (con): If we table, it doesn't mean that we disagree, it just means we don't agree with the bill as presented
	•	Motoki (pro): By voting on this bill and saying no to what it's saying, you're setting precedent that it's ok to restrict things that affect Northwestern's campus. Let's just vote on it, let's stop wasting time
	•	Motoki: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- division
	•	Ay- 14
	•	Nay- 18
	•	Abstentions- 5
	•	Motion to table indefinitely fails.
	•	Harrison: Motion to previous question
	•	Ian: Objection
	•	Harrison: We all agree that the bill in it's current form isn't something that should be passed
	•	Ian: Objection withdrawn, motion to move to vote.
	•	Vote- fails. Legislation is not passed.
VIII. Old Business: SR1213-06: Implementing the Northwestern Strategic Plan: Establishing Northwestern as a Global Leader in Environmental and Financial Sustainability
	•	Mark: Let's just go to questions.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Rebecca: Have you thought about if this will affect tuition at all?
	•	Mark: Read an article this morning that came out in the Chronicle for Higher Education on this topic- this type of movement will not affect endowments. I'm happy to forward those references to anyone who wants them.
	•	Dana: How many sponsors?
	•	Mark: Probably around 70 now
	•	Michelle: Have you talked to anyone who has not supported this in the administration?
	•	Mark: Not yet.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con.
	•	Ian: Motion to address the amendments to the bill outlined in the agenda.
	•	Mark: First clause to be removed refers to technicality not relevant to this resolution. The second clause
	•	Mike: By including the other clause, it could provide hurdles going forward since those who made these statements chose not to have their names on this. It's just best to strike it since it could entertain a lot of additional questions.
	•	Rebecca: Motion to previous question on the amendments.
	•	Vote-passed. Amendments are stricken.
	•	Jesse: Motion to strike clause "Whereas, the market performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Coal Index has proven to be volatile but ultimately stagnant over the past decade;"
	•	Parliamentary Body: Asked and answered last week.
	•	Jesse (con):  Clause should've been changed.
	•	Rebecca: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is approved.
IX. Old Business: SR1213-07: Gun Control Resolution
	•	Steven: Spoke about this last time, nothing as really changed. We are willing to strike language supporting the President since it could be interpreted as partisan, but the overarching belief of the bill is that intransience isn't acceptable on this issue. This isn't the first time student government has dealt with issues of this nature- when the debt ceiling debate came up, students at multiple universities voiced support that intransience isn't acceptable and it's our futures on the line. We are open to amendment that doesn't change the purpose of the bill.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Motoki: Thoughts on the last whereas statements?
	•	Steven: Wanted to address and compromise with those raising objections.  Our MLK speaker specifically referenced that students and student government should raise up about issues like gun control. Without issues like this, we might as well dissolve Senate.
	•	Jane: Motion to amend the be it resolved statement to remove the line "supports the President’s issuance of executive orders regarding improved gun regulations and"
	•	Jane: Went back to my constituents and talked to them about it, but constituents had problem with perceived partisan support
	•	Michelle: Motion to amend the amendment to add in "supports improved gun regulations and"
	•	Michelle: I agree with everything Jane says, just good to state that we support improved regulations
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question on the amendment of the amendment
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Amendment is amended from "supports the President’s issuance of executive orders regarding improved gun regulations and" to "supports improved gun regulations and"
	•	Rebecca: Motion to previous question
	•	Ian: Objection
	•	Rebecca: Withdrawn
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Ian (con): This amendment castrates a lot of the bills force. Would not like to see this removed from the bill, many members of our caucus would like to see this left in.
	•	Rebecca (pro): This amendment is important- there's evidence for every side, by stating that something is correct doesn't mean it is a fact
	•	Brad (pro): I think this makes the bill more accessible to the student body and makes the bill something everyone can get behind as a relevant issue for our campus.
	•	Ian (con): The wording is already careful enough to not suggest anything is right or wrong, just wants to voice support through executive orders and that the conversation has been started through the executive order's issuance.
	•	Jane (pro): I respectfully disagree with you, Ian. My constituents have stated to me that this wordage supports the President.
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote on the amendment
	•	Vote- division
	•	Ay- ~33
	•	Nay- 4
	•	Abstentions- 0
	•	Motoki: Motion to strike the last seven whereas clauses of the legislation.
	•	No second, motion fails.
	•	Evan: Motion to strike "Northwestern student body" from the final clause and replace with "Associated student Government
	•	Evan: I represent Allison Hall and sent out emails to my constituents, and got mixed responses about the bill. ASG is about facilitating connections between the student body and administrators or other students. Most of my constituents have a right to vote- when a bunch of our constituents may not agree with this, we shouldn't pass this
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian: Why didn't you support the motion to strike several amendments
	•	Evan: If we amend it to say ASG is taking charge of this as opposed to the entire student body, it's more representative
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Paul (con): We're representative, and things we pass speak with the voice of the student body, so striking this doesn't carry as much weight.
	•	Motoki (con) : Changing this would make it an official statement from us.
	•	Chris (pro): We need to be aware of how we make the population of Northwestern feel about the things we pass.
	•	Mike (pro): The wording change is appropriate based on the debate we've had. I do support the bill though.
	•	Petros (con): Think it's wrong to say we should change this based on it being controversial- we always discuss controversial things and if we didn't people would be right in saying ASG doesn't do anything. By striking this, it's redundant and kills a lot of the power of the bill. We should represent the students appropriately.
	•	Steven (con): Historically, student governments have taken up controversial issues- I know this is controversial, but we shouldn't shy away from this, we still represent all students and that should be taken into account
	•	Rebecca (pro): I want to echo what Chris was saying- it does sound better. I love controversial issues, but I'm here for my constituents to debate hardcore issues and then the student body. Since this takes a step away from affecting policy I'd be more comfortable with this wordage
	•	Brad (pro): There's a portion or majority of Northwestern students that would support this, not all of this. In US representative government, this distinction is made.
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote on the amendment.
	•	Vote- division
	•	Ay- 12
	•	Nay- 16
	•	Abstentions- 7
	•	Vote- fails. Amendment is not passed.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question
	•	Senators: Multiple objections
	•	Ian: Withdrawn
	•	Patrick: Motion to previous question
	•	Senators: Multiple objections
	•	Patrick: Withdrawn
	•	Ani: Moving back into pro/con on the resolution
	•	Ian (pro): This is important for our campus, we've discussed this a bit further, we've talked about this.
	•	Mike (pro): We, like many universities, are showing our support for movement on this issue and agree that it's best to take action.
	•	Rebecca (con): We supporting congress for doing their job? My alternative would be to create more groups at Northwestern to support this, rather than just telling Congress to do what it should be doing.
	•	Motoki: Motion to postpone this bill indefinitely
	•	Steven: What?!
	•	Motoki: I feel that this isn't our realm to be discussing. I don't want to say no or yes, postponing indefinitely is the way to go.
	•	Ani: Moving to pro/con
	•	Steven (con): That's why we have abstentions. The discussion on moving to only make it so that ASG is just supporting this, not the student body, avoids the question entirely. Hundreds of colleges support this and we need to stop with the motions designed to derail the conversation we're trying to have!
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- fails. Motion is rejected.
	•	Ani: Back to pro/con
	•	Victor (pro): Want to point out a few things- resolution provides flexibility like the ability to sign onto other agreement. We lobby congress on things like fiscal cliff, we only didn't do that because Senate wasn't meeting while it was relevant
	•	Paul (pro): The fact that Congress has such low approval ratings shows that maybe someone needs to tell them how to do their jobs
	•	Ani: In line for a vote
	•	Vote- passed. Resolution is approved.
X. Old Business: SL1213-20: Student Groups Vice President & Financial Vice President Selection Committees
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian: Why do you think it's important to keep the size of the committee constant while removing Senators?
	•	Victor: Not something we really thought about- for efficiency purposes, we figured there was enough Senate representation.
	•	Girish: We wanted to get more experience on the committee while maintaining Senate voice. Ani brought up the point that the Speaker can serve as a voice for Senate
	•	Lauren (point of information): I was appointed by a similar selection committee as this- not just anarchy.
	•	Victor: Motion to amend- add in lines to ensure that an additional Senator is elected in the case that the individual wishes to run again.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Amendment is included in the bill.
	•	Motoki: When are Senators selected for this
	•	Girish: was thinking of doing this next week
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Rebecca: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Legislation is approved.
XI. Old Business: SL1213-21: Ad-Hoc Committee on Gun Control
	•	Steven: We passed the resolution. Consider it, and then let's pass it.
	•	Rebecca: Motion to amend to change the part where it says "compose an open letter to Congress urging them to work with the Executive branch" to the opposite.
	•	Rebecca: I can't let this go without adding this amendment.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con on the amendment
	•	Ian (con): Aiming the letter at congress is the appropriate place and won't be treated as Presidential fan letter
	•	Steven (con): President has done his part by issuing executive orders- sometimes it's necessary to urge Congress to do their job. They're the ones who need action and that's how government works.
	•	Mark: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- fails. Amendment is defeated.
	•	Brad: Motion to amend the same line to state "to our representatives in the United States government"
	•	Ian: Objection, asked and answered
	•	Brad: I support this bill as well- the onus should be on everyone to work with each other, rather than for Congress to just work with the President
	•	Moving into pro/con on the amendment
	•	Petros (con): Disagree with the vague wording
	•	Mark (pro): I'm signed on this legislation with the idea that Northwestern students should work with the government. This is an expansion of that principle and gives the committee more room to work.
	•	Brad (pro): Just want to say that they're all culpable to work with each other
	•	Steven (con): President and VP have been the only ones to act in producing meaningful action. Congress is the one to work with since President initiated action. The letter from 300 universities stated working with congress.
	•	Victor (pro): Should prefer this amendment to increase flexibility
	•	Ian: Victor's point is good for freedom. FREEDOM.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is amended.
	•	Ian: Motion to amend  to add in a line to set up voting for the members of this ad-hoc.
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation has additional clause that states "Be it further enacted, that the members of the committee be elected in Senate one week following the passage of this legislation."
	•	Brad: Motion to amend to change "Senators" to "students" so that non-senators can serve
	•	Ian: Motion to amend to 5 members of ASG
	•	Rebecca: I see a valuable point of having students at large on this why can't they be on this?
	•	Ian: More accountable, better to have people who were in the room and had more
	•	Carly: If there was someone outside of ASG who was following this debate completely and wanted to get involved,  would you rethink your motion?
	•	Ian: No
	•	Vote- division
	•	Ay-23
	•	Nay- 7
	•	Abstentions- 3
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is amended to have five members of ASG on ad hoc.
	•	Motoki: Motion to have it say students instead of members of ASG
	•	Ani: Asked and answered
	•	Ani: Now moving to a vote on Brad's amendment
	•	Vote- approved. Legislation now states "5 members of ASG."
	•	Ani: Moving to pro/con on the legislation
	•	Rebecca (con): Let's not make this committee and instead make one that looks into protecting our students here.
	•	Ian (pro): I'm on 6 committees- behooves us to not follow up the resolution with action.
	•	Jesse: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is approved
XII. Good of the Order & Announcements
	•	Brad: Relevant mainly to student groups senators- in the Fall you voted to move Student Group apportionment to winter quarter and your seats are on the table. Make sure it's on your radar
	•	Mike: Two quick announcements. Community Engagement grant deadline in February 1st and Off campus ambassadors are doing an off-campus cook-off
	•	Evan: NU Protest is looking into the gun control debate. If you want to get interviewed let me know
	•	Jesse: Thinking about bringing legislation to say senate can't go past 10, if you want to help write it, let me know.
	•	Katie: Working at center for civic engagement, screening a film called girls on the wall
	•	Abby: Deadline to apply for FUP to be a counselor was extended to Friday at 5pm
	•	Rachel: This Friday night we're having a dinner first year students regardless of religion
	•	Jane: We're selling wristbands to support Josie, please help out
	•	Brad: You can talk to the press on your own free will, but we'd prefer that you talk to becca before you talk to them so we can prepare for any fallout
	•	Victor: buy a cats care shirt!

Senate Adjourned
