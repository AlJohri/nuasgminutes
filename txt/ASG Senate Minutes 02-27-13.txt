ASG Senate Minutes
02-27-13

I. Executive Board Reports
	•	Victor: Lakeside Architectural Committee met, facility should be designed in next year or so. Committee to renovate Norris also met, will be lobbying Board of Trustees and starting an awareness campaign for the changes. UBPC had annual presentation last week, presented a number of student priorities from surveying in last quarter, will get back to you soon. About the Student Activities Fee- will create university committee to lay groundwork for student group funding, discussing green fee tonight, and will see how student center support sets out
	•	Motoki (question): Will Norris renovations impact future lobbying for a new student center?
	•	Victor: The process has been that the consultants came up with two options on Garrett Parking Lot, and two options that involved building around the Norris site. In the long term, traffic flow will focus more on the east side of campus, so Norris would be most ideal.
	•	Brad: Amalia has to leave soon, so can I move into 10K?
	•	Ani: Sure
 
	•	[Later]

	•	Brad: Great news on a related front- reached an agreement with the Office of the Provost and student Affairs to free up $10,000 from our operating budget- they'll each take up $5,000 of Eva Jefferson Day.
	•	Carly: Go to coffee chats and talk to your OMs! Want to recognize Harrison as the Senator of the Week for his work last week on his legislation and all the groundwork he did with it.
	•	Lauren: Recognized a lot of groups and I'll be transitioning out once we select my successor this weekend.
	•	Neil: Nothing to add besides what's in my exec board report.
	•	Alex: Working on Norris stuff for Reading Week- things like a relaxation room or 24-hour space- let me know if you have feedback on this. Also working on staff appreciation, looking at timeline in the middle of spring- also reaching out to the Living Wage Campaign and RHA and RCB- let me know if you want to get involved.
	•	Steven: Look online for information on voter registration.
	•	Chris (question): If a Senator was living on campus in a contested district, should they be voting?
	•	Steven: The only district students can vote in are dorms west of Sheridan, not including Elder. If we all vote, it's a big deal.
	•	Motoki: Is the link you provided easily accessible?
	•	Brad: It'll be added to the front page of the ASG website soon.
	•	Ani: On behalf of Hayley, there's a march tomorrow on behalf of Michael Collins at 1:30 at Tech.
	•	Sofia: Also a panel happening tomorrow…
	•	Victor: There's a Q&A tomorrow in the Armadillo Room about the diversity requirement
	•	Ani: Actually next week.
II. Caucus Whip Reports
	•	Ian: Library charger ad hoc is gone, voted to buy six chargers. Rest of money unspent will be rolled back into the pool.
III. General Order: 10K Committee Presentation
	•	Brad: It's your decision to decide what ideas we move forward with and then it goes up to a campus wide vote. Please hold onto your questions until the end.
	•	Brad: We got a lot more submissions than usual, but were limited by a number of concerns, many of them financial. PTI stated that of 14 final ideas, she would only release funding for 4.
	•	Amailia: First idea was for outdoor benches in many of the grassy areas around campus.
	•	Guarav: Another idea was to construct a statue of Willie the Wildcat.
	•	Evan: The next idea we decided on was an outdoor film series- would likely have enough money for 6 films.
	•	Amalia: Picnic tables- totally different from benches! And they can be purple.
	•	Brad: Other ideas that PTI wouldn't fund her half of the $10,000 for, but want to push forward with is Front-end Composting
	•	Amalia: … and Installing hammocks would be another idea to use that we'd only be able to use $5,000.
	•	Brad: To give you an idea of other ideas we wanted but couldn't put on the final list of ideas, here are 8 more ideas that didn't make it
	•	Ian: Expanding WildRoots Garden, purchasing of weights for Blomquist, nap pods, installing a US post-box at Norris, remove obstructions from Ryan Field student section, solar tree, LED bus stop signs that display ETA for shuttles & more computers for tech library.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian H: I'm underwhelmed, were you guys also underwhelmed by this?
	•	Amalia: Had a lot of great ideas that couldn't be reached with 10K, unfortunately.
	•	Ian: Some of the projects also had too long of a timeframe.
	•	Guarav: 10K can't do a whole lot, unfortunately.
	•	Brad: We will go to departments and ask if they'll match if it's one of the ideas that needs more funding.
	•	Motoki: Most of these are summer-friendly, were there any more winter-centric suggestions?
	•	Amalia: Heat lamps came up.
	•	Evan: Also adding more library rooms, but since the library is already undergoing renovations, we decided against pursuing that further.
	•	Petros: What is PTI's argument for building the Wildcat Statue as a way to build community.
	•	Brad: At a lot of other universities they have statues like this- students usually take pictures with statues like these, could contribute to pride and community in that way.
	•	Steven: For releasing these ideas, is there a good way to differentiate between things fully funded and best way to ensure these ideas aren't unfairly biased?
	•	Brad: Haven't thought about it yet, open to ideas.
	•	Sarah: For the picnic tables and benches, how many would we be getting for the price exactly?
	•	Brad: Would just buy as much as we can
	•	Dana: If the hammocks weren't out all the time, who'd manage them?
	•	Brad: Facilities Management, likely.
	•	Patrick: Couldn't the film series be done as a collaboration with someone who usually does them? Like A&O?
	•	Evan: talked to them, might be possibility for collaboration in the future if this idea gets selected.
	•	Sofia: Details on the size of the statue?
	•	Brad: Think life-size.
	•	Motoki: All of these will be implemented by the end of spring quarter?
	•	Brad: With the exception of the statue, all would be done by the end of spring quarter. There's a committee for adding aesthetic elements on campus that would need to review the statue proposal if it's selected.
	•	Sean: Thought everything had to be done by the end of spring quarter?
	•	Brad: Want to get everything done before end of spring quarter, but since there's summer after and no students are here, definite deadline is beginning of fall before students get back.
	•	Lauren M: Feedback on how you all feel about the fast timeline aspect of this process?
	•	Ian: Ensures things get done and ensures the process has finality and that things get enacted quickly.
	•	Michelle: Would PTI override anything we select?
	•	Brad: It's possible.
	•	Mark: Have you spoken to risk management about the hammocks?
	•	Brad: Spoken to facilities, not risk management.
	•	Mark: In past events, risk management had problems with slack lines even a few feet off the ground, might be a problem.
	•	Sean: Would the film series be an event or series?
	•	Guarav: Would happen 5 or 6 times in a single year.
	•	Paul: Motion to remove hammocks from list of recommendations.
	•	Paul: Everyone loves sitting on a new hammock, but after a couple months, they'd get pretty abused, in addition to the risk management issue, I just don't think it's a good idea.
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote on removing hammocks from the list.
	•	Vote- passed. Hammocks are removed.
	•	Ani: Further questions?
	•	Katie: Possibility of combining picnic tables and benches?
	•	Brad: We thought about that and decided we'd split the ideas for Senate to vote on.
	•	Abby: Difference between front and back end composting?
	•	Mark: The composting that you don't see happening when you send your tray back for it to cleaned is back-end composting; front-end composting involves telling students about how they can compost and allowing them to do it themselves.
	•	Brad: Would involve purchasing signage and receptacles for people to do their own composting
	•	Girish: Isn't there a chance that students could mess this up?
	•	Mark: Often when this is introduced elsewhere, there is a learning curve, but after that period of learning, people spread these ideas positively.
	•	Alexander: Motion to remove front end composting.
	•	Alexander: since it's the only $5,000 idea left, it wouldn't be entirely honest of us to put this idea up knowing it'd only get $5,000 while other ideas would $10,000.
	•	Ani: 10K Committee opinion?
	•	Brad: We would indicate the difference and make it clear.
	•	Evan: It would be better to keep it on rather than just taking it off to just take it off so that students aren't underwhelmed by the low number of other ideas.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con on the motion.
	•	Dana (con): really great idea, and unfortunate PTI didn't want to fund it. Should still happen
	•	Steven (con): I agree- this fund was intended to be controlled by students separate from the university's veto power. If students want something, it should signal to the university that students do want something and can make adjustments from there.
	•	Motoki: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- fails. Item remains on the list.
	•	Ani: Further questions?
	•	Connor: Question about picnic tables- would they be wooden like the ones in the picture?
	•	Brad: Presentation picture was a stock picture, will likely be the ones that are out on East Lawn right now.
	•	Alexander: Motion to remove benches and combine picnic tables and benches.
	•	Alexander: I think the two belong together- keeping them separate will cause people to have internal debate between the two.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Mark: What exactly is the difference between the two items?
	•	Ian: Without seating, isn't a picnic table. Complicated issue.
	•	Brad: Practical distinction in that one of the primary obstacles we faced in that many of these would be difficult to implement without conflicting with existing fire lanes
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Motoki (con): I think there's a difference between the two- benches are more couple friendly and picnic tables are more community friendly- people would want one or the other, should give people the option to list how many they want of each.
	•	Angela (pro): Just in terms of the impressions I got from splitting into smaller groups, people think Senate is overly bureaucratic- students will see the differentiation between the two as not making a difference
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- approved. Items are combined.
	•	Mark: Motion to end this.
	•	Vote- approved. Ideas are approved.
IV. General Order: Community and Service Engagement Grant Allocation
	•	Patrick: Gave $100 to Arts in the Community painting a firehouse, gave $200 to SEED to do environmental awareness at an elementary school, also awarded $200 to EMERGE, a leadership program at ETHS that
	•	Chris: To put in context- the committee chose these three ideas and need to confirm them now with Senate.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian: Did all the groups apply for $500?
	•	Patrick: Arts in the Community asked for $100, allocated super well. Most of the other organizations asked for $400 or $500 dollars. A lot of them asked for transportation or food, but sought to fund things focused most on programming. Seemed to make most sense to split the funding between these
	•	Mike: Can provide brief context- found out from admin that most of those who applied for this grant can get money through other sources of funding. Student groups can get other funding in this way.
	•	Chris: They knew when they applied it'd be up to $500 and that Senate would either give a full $500 or a piecemeal allocation
	•	Patrick: Determined this was the most fair way to split up.
	•	Ian: Did you fund any of the applications that included food or transportation?
	•	Chris: No.
	•	Motoki: Accountability measure to make sure what is proposed actually happens?
	•	Mike: Says in the legislation that money not used will be returned to the project pool- no specific accountability measure
	•	Mark: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. Funds are allocated.
V. Old Business: SL1213-23: Parliamentary Body Constitutional Amendment
	•	Lauren: Back again- this removes the Treasurer position and elevates caucus whips to Parliamentary Body.
	•	Ian: Motion to divide the question between removing the treasurer and the elevation of the caucus whips.
	•	Vote- passes. The question has been divided.
	•	Ani: Discussing the Parliamentary Body part of the bill first.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question
	•	Ian: Withdrawn
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Motoki (con): There's a lot in the constitution and code about the parliamentary body. I'm not sure if this set up of caucus is the right way of setting it up- by putting things like this in the constitution makes it harder to change the structure. Not having this in there won't hurt operation of ASG,
	•	Mark (question): If you don't institutionalize caucus whip positions, what meaning does their position hold without this codification.
	•	Ani: Make it into a pro speech
	•	Mark (pro): This is important because it legitimately moves the whips to a larger, more representative role, and their representations needs to be stated explicitly in our guidelines.
	•	Ian (pro): To address Motoki's point, adding in this definition of caucus doesn't make it more rigid- we'd need to change the Senator structure as well, defining the whip's representation only makes sense.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- division
	•	Ay: 30
	•	Nay: 3
	•	Abstentions: 3
	•	Vote- passed. Amendment is implemented into Constitution.
	•	Ani: Moving onto the other half of the question.
	•	Brad: Want to talk about this since this is a bit more controversial than our last change. It's substantial in that it eliminates a position from the executive board. The executive board as a whole is inefficient- the treasurer position as it currently exists is redundant. My position sees all internal operations of ASG- VPs come to me with all requests for money, then David Chi has to approve the money. Would reduce redundancy. All monetary requests have to be approved by Natalie, so that would serve as a check against unrestrained spending. Further, legislation adds in provisions about coming to Senate reporting expenditures.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	April: Why not make the Treasurer a more central part of the conversation.
	•	Brad: It's just redundant- it's asking two people to do the work that one person could do.
	•	Alexander: How to change the details of the EVP position to reflect this?
	•	Brad: Will list it under job description, and additional job responsibilities should be manageable.
	•	Girish: The hardest thing a Treasurer does is manage internal finance, and Brad does that already.
	•	Motoki: A question that came up in caucus was asking whether EVP is doing awesome or Treasurer just doing poorly
	•	Girish: Empirically, treasurer's role has been unclear and unlike other group's treasurers.
	•	Brad: Further redundant.
	•	Victor: given that we're shifting away from MLK and have a shifting up Chief of Staff, Treasurer just isn't a full exec position
	•	April: Why can't we combine FVP and Treasurer?
	•	Girish: I'd have to conduct audits of ASG, would be huge conflict of interest.
	•	Mark: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote division
	•	Ay: 34
	•	Nay: 1
	•	Abstentions: 0
	•	Vote- passed. Amendment is implemented into Constitution.
VI. Old Business: SL1213-22: Parliamentary Body Code Amendment
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- division
	•	Ay: 35
	•	Nay: 0
	•	Abstentions: 1
	•	Vote- passed. Amendment is implemented into Constitution.
VII. Old Business: SR1213-11: Acknowledging Our History
	•	Ian: One of the co-presidents of NAISA is here.
	•	NAISA: This is a resolution in support of a recently circulated petition that provides a statement supporting the logistics of the petition and the ideas behind it. There's been a committee established by the Provost to look into it, but we have records of $200,000 donated directly to Northwestern, translating to about $2 million today. We have at least two historical accounts of him supporting genocide of Native Americans. Provost Linzer refused to allow students and Cheyenne people. Brown university went through a similar process- important for educating people on our history
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Alexander: What specific action do you want to see come from this
	•	NAISA: Body of legislation meant to provide history- in the petition, we ask that the committee be formed and that things be changed on campus to amend institutions named after John Evans be changed. Also institute more support for a Native American Studies Program
	•	Sarah: Whose recommendations are those
	•	NAISA: Put forth by NAISA- the only part that's been acted on by university is formation of a university committee
	•	Sarah: Hoping that this resolution will support those opinions and recommendations?
	•	Ian: Resolution doesn't restate support for the petition completely- primarily wants to push support for resolution of this issue in a similar fashion to other peer-institutions.
	•	Brad: Motion to amend final be it resolved clause to state "to involve students directly in the Committee’s work."
	•	NAISA: Might be too forceful
	•	Brad: Motion rescinded
	•	Lauren: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Legislation is approved.
VIII. New Business: SL1213-26: Campaign Reform Recommendations
	•	Carly: Our committee spent hours over this proposal- made these recommendations to make things more transparent.
	•	Ian: To walk through the legislation, first change would be to elect election commission at beginning of winter quarter. Would change voting to preferential, require 300 signatures . Review election guidelines in spring immediately following election.
	•	Ani: questions?
	•	Chris: Will this at all impact this years election?
	•	Ian: The pre-campaigning stuff won't, but everything else will
	•	Alex L: Don't understand rationale for having Senators attend debates.
	•	Abby: I was on the election commission last year and was disappointed by the turnout. We represent the student body- though we can't mandate the entire student body to go, we have our 51 members and can make sure the Senators inform the student body.
	•	Alex L: Why doesn't Senate elect them outright then?
	•	Abby: We're mandated to spread information as Senators and we're just expanding that idea.
	•	Carly: Not excluding others from going, still encouraging others to attend.
	•	Mike (point of information): how many debates
	•	Abby: 4
	•	Mike: And Senators need to attend all 4?
	•	Abby: Yes
	•	Chris: For your survey results- can you publish the results?
	•	Ian: Don't want to publish the results- decision wasn't wholly based on survey. Also might've received contradictory evidence from survey and can't do both.
	•	Sarah: Can send substitute for debates in your place?
	•	Ian: Yes.
	•	Motoki: Penalty for missing debate?
	•	Mark: Full absence.
	•	Katie: Will exec be mandated to attend
	•	Ian: Can amend to reflect that...
	•	Brad: Where will funding for the baseline materials in this come from?
	•	Ian: Amount won't be much, somewhere around $280- hope to get money from this in our budget and will put it in the budget in the future.
	•	Chris: Majority of suggestions weren't from survey- where did you get ideas to change this?
	•	Ian: COFHE research and former experience with elections.
	•	Brad: Any efforts to solicit feedback from the larger student body given that in some areas excessive use of chalk is suggested?
	•	Ian: Personal experience from members of our constituency that there was an over abundance of chalk.
	•	Brad: Would you be open to having a forum about this to solicit campus opinions about this
	•	Ian: Don't see relevance of having a forum just concerning this.
	•	April: Will the election commission encourage the PR chair to publicize debates more?
	•	Ian: Felt responsibility should be taken up more by election commission to publicize
	•	Katie: Did you say the election commission will be elected next week? What about people outside of Senate?
	•	Ian: Talked to Ani and Brad about this- will publicize as best we can.
	•	Ani: If there are no further questions, this is new business, we'll see it as old business next week.
IX. New Business: SR1213-12: Sustainability Fund - Authorship Presentation
	•	Mark: Legislation has grown irrelevant- here's a presentation about the Green Fund as conditions stand.
	•	Victor: This legislation is important to express to the Board of Trustees that this is important- though this will be heavily amended next week, we hope that this will be something useful for supporting a pilot program. All the of the values are the same, just changing from asking for a student fee to asking the budget office for this.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Motoki: Can you reiterate how this will be used?
	•	Mark: Improving the undergraduate experience through sustainability, could mean a number of things and is very flexible. Decisions will be made by advisory committee
	•	Abby: Selection of committee members for this?
	•	Mark: ASG AVP is permanent co-chair with various other representatives appointed from other groups and an application process. Plenty of ASG representation
	•	Motoki: How much of the campus cares about sustainability to warrant this?
	•	Mark: Not sufficient funding for sustainability initiatives, only one grant.
	•	Brad: Asked UBPC to include a question regarding splitting money- survey information shows students would be comfortable funding a new student center at the same rate.
	•	Victor: Also sufficient amount of demand from other sources.
X. Good of the Order & Announcements
	•	Ian: Come to the armadillo room next Thursday fi you have any feedback on the diversity requirement
	•	April: Please come out for tomorrow's march for Michael Collins
	•	Sean: BJ Novak tickets still on sale, followed by Skyfall screening
	•	Gio: MGC banquet.
	•	Lauren: Next Wednesday- we're having our 14th annual comedy beatdown, tickets are $5.
	•	Mike: For garage sale- will bring in munchkins next week if I get 40 more responses before 12:30.

Senate Adjourned
