	•	Rose: And as always, if you have any thoughts or 
	•	Hiro: Please send Hiro your committee evaluations.  Also, we are doing a walk through of tech to find cell-phone and wi-fi deadspots.  Next week are meeting with McCormick to give them our proposal.
	•	Wilson: If you didn’t get the email from Francis about the survey, please let Wilson know so that we can get you on the roster.
	•	Special Order: Student Group Derecognition
	•	Wilson: This is a part of Liz’s job.  
	•	Liz: Would like to derecognize two groups.
	•	Q: Did you attempt to contact them?

	•	New Business: SL 1011-03 Cabinet Transitions
	•	Nalin: Will basically legitimize the interim period between when a person has been chosen for office, but not confirmed.
	•	Amalia: Essentially this is just a fix of the code.  This just says that a person who is “slated” for an exec position can’t begin the transition process until 7 days before they are scheduled to be confirmed by exec.
	•	New Business: SL 1011-04
	•	Brandon: Just saying that you can’t have alternates during funding meetings.  This is so that an un-elected member of Senate can’t vote for something as important as money distribution.
	•	Q: Did you maybe consider counting missing Senate funding as a higher absence then 
	•	New Business:  SL 1011-0 Senate Representation Evaluation
	•	Claire: We want to create an ad hoc committee that will evaluate the representation of Senate.  Really take a look at the structure and form of Senate.  Essentially trying to create a process where people can weigh in on the what they think of Senate.  The Ad Hoc committee will be chaired by Claire, with one non-ASG student at large, 3 exec board members (Wilson, Francis, and Hiro), 4 senators appointed by each of the caucuses.
	•	Good of the Order
	•	Amalia: Cleave Jones!!!  Come get your tickets at the Norris Box Office
	•	Razna: MCSA will have a panel of 3 speakers who are talking about the extremism of Islam
	•	Barry: This weekend is Parent’s Weekend.  What do you do at 7pm?  You should take them to Inception at 7pm and 10pm in McCormick!!!  Also, there’s a Senior Tailgate this Saturday as well.
	•	Beau: ISEC has an info session tomorrow!  Come!
