Meeting of the Senate
November, 19, 2014

	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	Wild Ideas Fund Request: Lambda Upsilon Lambda and brought in a professor to speak about Colombia. The money largely went to food to heighten the event. The turnout was great with 40 people. 
	•	General Order: A-Status Funding Primer/B-Status Funding Reminder
	•	Old  Business: B-Status Funding Recommendations
	•	Cut round, groups in a random order. 
	•	Add round, groups in a random order. 
	•	Moira: Motion to add a line item for public storage for SJP. There was a misunderstanding from the student group. The GE for the student group was taking the quarter off, so Alex temporarily took over those duties. SJP didn’t understand until after the funding applications that public storage was possible for their group. They need public storage because they have a lot of things like a wall that needs to be housed and also SJP’s publicity materials have been getting vandalized, so they need a safe space. 
	•	SGC: SGC supports that. When they asked we weren’t sure if we were funding public storage and SJP interpreted as public storage was not possible. We want to rectify that mistake. 
	•	PQ
	•	Vote: Passes. 
	•	Moira: I motion to add $150 dollars to that line item, but that is my understanding for it as a standardized amount. 
	•	SGC: It’s not standardized, but that is the amount we gave other groups. 
	•	PQ
	•	Vote: Passes. 
	•	SGC: Motion to add. Would like to add $40 to ribbons, $20 to buttons and $25 to posters. We thought the ribbons were marketing, but we realized they are actually reusable, so they are a capital campaign. The buttons are marketing, so we want to give them $25. The posters are reusable also, so that is a capital improvement. 
	•	PQ
	•	Vote: Passes. 
	•	Issac: Motion to eliminate the last cut round. 
	•	Vote: Passes.

	•	Moira: Motion to propose emergency legislation. Last night Students for Justice in Palestine hung up a banner and this morning it had been cut down and is missing. This resolution asks ASG to condemn the theft of the banner and promote a safe community for student groups and to protect free speech. It is emergency legislation because it happened last night and I think it is important to respond to injustice quickly. 
	•	Noah: We will now vote. Passes. 
New Business: Allowing a Palestinian Voice on Campus
	•	Moira: We are the four authors of this legislation and there are also a few other sponsors. I’ll read a few of the most important lines. The banner read: “More than 5.3 million Palestinians have been forced out of their homes by the state of Israel since its creation,” and included citation to the United Nations Works and Relief Agency. It said that and SJP in the corner. It was gone by 8am today with no signs of it being blown away - the rope had clearly been cut with a blade. This constitutes theft of property and violates SJP’s right to free speech on campus. It threatens the ability of students and political groups to feel safe when continuing their work. 
	•	Ruba: We are basically asking ASG to condemn this violation of free speech. We’d like to point out this doesn’t end with SJP. That is why it is emergency legislation, but we think this will allow students to feel more comfortable speaking out. Additionally, the banner was part of a larger campaign. 
	•	Alec: Do you intend to move this to old business? 
	•	Ruba: No
	•	Daniel: Was anything else on the banner?
	•	Black and white text, a link, and the quote. 
	•	Ruba: Motion to move this to old business. 
	•	Noah: Seeing no objections we will vote. Passes. We will see this at the end of the agenda.
	•	New Business: A-Status Funding
	•	Eliza: This is student’s money and we allocate with that in mind. It is an application and interview process. The groups submit an application with their AE and go over it with them. Then it goes to the committee, we meet with the groups. We fund based on how the event has gone, how contracts are handled, how they interact with their AE, etc. there are many factors to consider. SAFC spends a lot of time on these recommendations, so please consider them. Just as SGC has standards, SAFC has even more extensive standards. 
	•	Isaac: SASA funding, one of the stated reasons is lack of event success. I thought the event went from 30 to 300 people. Can you define lack of event success?
	•	Eliza: That event was incredibly successful, but there were some behind the scenes things that determined SAFC’s decision. 
	•	New Business: SL1415-06: Transferring SOFO Responsibility
	•	Erik: A lot of the SOFO rules are more in line with the Chief of Staff position. It is a time suck and keeps me from doing a lot of the stuff I was elected to do. I would like to move this to old business tonight since it is internal management and will make our transition smoother. 
	•	Jonathan: How will this affect the Chief of Staff? 
	•	Erik: It is an addition to their responsibilities. Right now they chair a bunch of committees and run the office, so they are already working closely with all these people. It shouldn’t be too much additional work and I’ll definitely help during the transition. 
	•	Nehaarika: Is there anything in the code that delineates this? 
	•	Erik: It is specifically stated in the code that the EVP handles the finances. 
	•	Grace: Can you speak to our current Chief of Staff’s qualifications? 
	•	Erik: Andrew served on the SAFC and is very aware of SOFO and audit trails. 
	•	Erik: Motion to move to old business. 
	•	Noah: Passes. We are going to discuss this now, because Erik needs to leave. 
	•	PQ
	•	Noah: Seeing no objections. Passes unanimously. 
	•	New Business: SR1415-03: Addressing Socioeconomic Status at Northwestern (see: Presentation) 
	•	Isaac: Motion to moving it to the end of new business. Amanda Walsh who is the president of Quest Scholars is currently in class and should not be out until 8:30 at the earliest. 
	•	Noah: No objections. Passes unanimously. 
	•	New Business: SR1415-04 Flyering: Not So Fly
	•	Christina: I’m here with members of the sustainability committee. We have been having conversations about ground flyering within exec and have decided that it is not a great way of advertising. We want to reduce ground flyering in general and want to start with the exec board. 
	•	Lindsey: We found that ground flyering is really wasteful. There are so many flyers, after it rains you can’t use it, facilities management needs to clean it up and they also have to use power washers to do so, which wastes water. In the future we hope to get rid of it entirely. 
	•	Alec: This legislation says we support the exec board’s decision to move away from this form and that we want other groups to do so. 
	•	Nikki: ASG, like it has before, is going to serve as a pilot project. 
	•	Johnny: Does the rule oblige ASG committees and caucuses not to flyer? 
	•	Alec: It’s not binding, but the exec board has come to that decision. 
	•	Nehaarika: When was that decision made? 
	•	Christina: It wasn’t published, but we’ve talked about it multiple times. 
	•	Isaac: Why isn’t this legislation? 
	•	Alec: They already did this, so we are just supporting them. 
	•	Grace: Are you thinking of making this legislation in the future? 
	•	Lindsey: In the future we want to come up with a good alternative. In the future, we would like to get it banned. 
	•	Jake: Have you thought about making it legislation, because groups get their funding from ASG?
	•	Alec: We don’t think we’re at that point yet, because we want to do research for an alternative to not hurt student groups. 

	•	Ronak: Motion to introduce emergency legislation. I don’t know if you read the daily article about Northwestern’s policy on marijuana for Ski Trip. Colorado has legalized marijuana and Northwestern says students will be held accountable as if they were in Illinois. It is emergency legislation so that we can vote on it next Senate before Ski Trip. 
	•	Isaac: Is it a resolution? 
	•	Ronak: Yes it is a resolution. 
	•	Jonathan: I don’t see why this needs to be emergency legislation. Why do we need to respond to this policy?
	•	The real problem with this is that if you are a 21 year old in Colorado who want to use cannabis legally, it pushes students to more dangerous substances. The idea is that this student policy is pushing students to use more dangerous substances. 
	•	PQ
	•	Passes, one nay vote. 
	•	Noah: I’m stepping down to speak about it
	•	Daniel: Hi, i’m the prez of SSDP. Our goal is that drug use is an individual right, and that in light of that instead of abstinence only, we should use education and counseling to reduce the dangers. this allows students who are over 21 can follow the law and not face punitive punishments from the university. cannabis is a safer alternative to alcohol, and if you are 21 on ski trip and want to use a safer alternative you should be able to do so. also allow the university to tell the students what their policy is. universities have to comply with federal drug laws to recieve funding. but there are 100 medical amnesty acts allowing students to use medical marijuana, without losing federal funding. if we allow students to use cannabis
	•	Noah: why i wanted to come on as a sponsor is that i want the adminsitration to be held accountble when their policies don’t match the student conduct handbook. the fact of the matter is that weed is legal in CO, and it’s patronizing and hypocriical for the administration to hold students accountable.
	•	Isaac: When was this policy announced by the uni?
	•	Dan: This is a continuation of university policy. 
	•	Jonathan: do you think that northwestern policy will cause students to smoke less on ski trip, and if not, why is this resolution necessary?
	•	Dan: it will affect the # of students
	•	Noah: it’s not about students smoking, its about making sure that the adminsitration is held accountable 
	•	*discussion on sponsoring emergency legislation*
	•	Kenny: which part of the administration are we sending this to?
	•	Dan: Student Conduct
	•	Noah: the idea is to demonstrate widespread student support to what we see as a grievance
	•	Isaac: are you content to see this seen next senate?
	•	Noah: i was hoping to push this to old business
	•	Its a thing that if you are over 21 you can’t be around underage drinkers?
	•	that’s only a university rule relating to dorms
	•	Clarification: university policy is that when you are accepted to northwestern, you sign an agreement that you will uphold this set of standards (i.e. the handboook). whether you are here or 100 miles away, you are expected to follow the handbook. Flipside: student conduct is not actively looking for violators. 
	•	Motion to move to old business; seconded
	•	Noah: it is important to move this to old business ...
	•	Moves to old business!
	•	The questioning period counts as a pro
	•	Jonathan: when students are on a school-sponsored event, they represnt northwestern. i dont feel this is an issue we should harp the administration on. if students want to smoke, they don’t care about administration policy.
	•	Isaack: Pro. We’re not going to change anyone’s mind on marijana policy. PQ.
	•	Obections.
	•	Withdrawn.
	•	Danny: Pro. I think it is a high priority. it is a student safety priority. students will decide whetehr they want to smoke pot or not, but if there are school sanctions students will use the more dangerous alternative (alcohol).
	•	Con: nobody has presented to me adequate evidence that students will find this policy relevant to their decision to use marijana. 
	•	Pro: i feel the issue of whether or not they want to do it should take a back burner to the decision that whether or not they are following 
	•	Moira: it would be beneficial to err on the side of protecting students against being punished for doing something that is legal. Promote safety of stuents
	•	Noah: PQ; seconded
	•	Vote: 
	•	That motion passes. One Nay, several abstentions
	•	New Business: SL1415-08 Off-Campus Elections
	•	Matt: Back in the spring we formed a working group to look at the Off Campus Senator election process and improve what has been a neglected caucus. We have come up with this plan to improve the process. The election cycle will be matched with the presidential election in the spring. Off campus residents vote in significant numbers in the election, so we think it would improve voter turnout. 
	•	Isaac: Are we worried this will disenfranchise a lot of people who will be living off campus and discourage seniors from running?
	•	Ronak: We think it is the best way to enfranchise people? 
	•	Sam: Would it be possible to vote for just one or the other? 
	•	The is to be determined. 
	•	Why ask for 25 signatures? 
	•	We thought that was the number we needed. 
	•	Nehaarika: Does this mean you need to vote for president to vote for your senator? 
	•	It depends on how the ballot is made, but most likely not. 

New Business: SR1415-03: Addressing Socioeconomic Status at Northwestern (see: Presentation) 
	•	Presented. Isaac does not know how to use a PC. 
	•	Ross: Can you ask about the last be it resolved and why it is necessary? 
	•	Austin: Isaac, Amanda and I are working with a faculty group to try to increase the number of lower income students. We want to see pell grants increase. We are currently around 16% and we want to get to 20% by 2020. Morty did recently say he wanted to see the students on pell grants increase in possibly a shorter time frame. 
	•	Amanda: Some of the California schools that Northwestern considers peer institutions are at over 30%. 
	•	Isaac: We also want the university to set objectives and create a goal. 
	•	What feedback have you gotten so far from the library? 
	•	Amanda: I think the conversations we have has indicated that it would be a financial burden. But they are willing to publicize further the services they have right now. 
	•	Anna: I will add that they are really supportive of their online system and the interlibrary loans, it’s just a financial issue right now. 
	•	Moira: The negative score northwestern got, why do you think they got it? 
	•	Isaac: Part of it is the pure statistic and part of it is the average financial aid people get. Northwestern has a startling high expectations for families to pay. 
	•	Nehaarika: Can you explain why you decided to make this a resolution? And why the points are all so specific? 
	•	Austin: We do not have authority over the university decisions. 
	•	Isaac: We also wanted to be specific, because we want the document to be guiding and not just a general “ASG wants diversity!” claim. 
	•	Amanda: I also think passing this is important, because it gives us weight when going to administrators. This resolution also brings together what groups are all doing separately, so it creates a united front. 
	•	Motion to move to old business. 
	•	Passes. 
	•	Old  Business: SR1415-02: Support for Increased Northwestern Response to Ebola Crisis
	•	I don’t really have anything new to add. We just want to get this passed so we can approach the university. 
	•	PQ
	•	Passes. 
	•	Old  Business: SL1415-06: ASG Feedback Working Group
	•	Jaimie: Hi! We are back trying to make our communication group into an actual working group. It will look at how we communicate and put our message forward. 
	•	PQ
	•	Passes unanimously. 
	•	Old Business:  SL1415-09: Wild Ideas: Brady Five Screening of the Homestretch
	•	It is for $700. $500 for rights and $200 for a speaker. The Brady Five are screening a movie called the Homestretch. It is about students who are homeless and attending Chicago Public Schools. They initially asked for a lot more, but the bare minimum they need is $500. They are in the process of getting funding from other people. They are also doing a great time on marketing and are doing PR with related groups. 
	•	PQ
	•	Passes unanimously. 
Old Business: Allowing a Palestinian Voice on Campus
	•	Moira: Hopefully you have gotten more of a chance to look through the wording of the legislation. Another reason I think it is important for us to pass this is this kind of thing is not an anomaly for SJP. It is almost expensive that this would happen to our materials and it is unfortunate that a student groups has to deal with expecting their materials to be ruined. When we painted the rock it was painted over and we have seen flyers get taken down. No student group should have to deal with that on campus. For the sake of personal safety of the number and the right of all student groups to share political opinions, it is important to pass this. 
	•	Daniel: Can you speak to some more of the vandalism that has occured? 
	•	Sara: The rock last year, many of our fliers have been taken down. This banner along wiht supplementary materials that were put up last night at 7:30 pm. 
	•	Daniel: Have you ever been able to identify individuals? 
	•	Moira: With the exception of times we have seen people throw stuff away, no. With the banner there is no camera, it was in the middle of the night, no one saw it - we couldn’t say who did it. 
	•	Nehaarika: Are you taking any measures to actually stop the measures?
	•	-: We filled out RespectNU twice last year and filed a police report for what happened last night. 
	•	Moira: It’s not just one person, it’s an overall climate where it is acceptable. Voicing public condemnation of this activity is important part. 
	•	Grace: How would you use this resolution to further your cause of promoting free speech? 
	•	Ruba: It is not so much for our purposes. This resolution would stand more as a symbol to the rest of campus that we do not support acts like this as a student body. 
	•	Ariel: On behalf of Hillel I want to strongly condemn the actions that were taken last night. My only reservation about the legislation is that it states that “disrespects the 5.3 million individuals displaced from their homes by the State of Israel” and this would cause ASG to say this as fact. I think this line deviates from the purpose of this legislation. 
	•	Moira: The fact that was on the banner was not a random act, so it was clearly a politically motivated attack and against that fact. The 5.3 million statistic, that is the number of people who were refugees in 48 and all the people who have been displaced within the country. It is not a disputable fact and is not a political statement. Members of SJP have family who are part of that statistic and they feel targeted about that statistic. 
	•	Ariel: I get that, but the purpose of the legislation is not to confirm the fact or not, but to condemn the actions taken last night. 
	•	Jonathan: Motion to amend. I motion to take away the line: disrespects the 5.3 million individuals displaced from their homes by the State of Israel, which includes members of Northwestern families . It is inaccurate.  We really need to focus on what the resolution is saying, which is about condemning the act of violating free speech on campus. Without this line, all parties would be in support of this. 
	•	Ruba: This act was targeting my identity as a descendant and a Palestinian. 
	•	Motion to amend. I propose that we only strike the 5.3 figure. We are not looking to make a political statement and I don’t think there is a question that Israel has displaced families. 
	•	Moira: The 5.3 statistic is from the UN. One of us could provide the link if you need us to. It is a fact. I think that this issue is a political issue, because taking down the banner was a political act. By including the reason why it was taken down, we are not making it unnecessarily political. 
	•	Daniel: Are agree that we are doing this to condemn the act, so publicizing why it was an issue in the first place is 
	•	Motion to suspend the rules. 
	•	Passes. 
	•	Amendments: 
	•	disrespects the 5.3 million individuals displaced from their homes by the State of Israel , which includes members of Northwestern families
	•	disrespects the 5.3 million individuals displaced from their homes by the State of Israel , which includes members of Northwestern families
	•	disrespects the 5.3 million (according to the UNRWA) individuals displaced from their homes by the State of Israel, which includes members of Northwestern families
	•	disrespects the 5.3 million individuals displaced from their homes by the State of Israel, which includes members of Northwestern families
	•	Jonathan: The document says 750,000 actual refugees, the rest are descendant and other groups. 
	•	Ronak: I see the fact but without the words “by the State of Israel”.
	•	Isaac: I really think that the citation is the right way to go, because it says where the number is coming from. 
	•	Serene: For the 5.3 million, the reason this is so confusing is that the refugees are so fragmented purposefully. I think it is important to include that clause and it is important to include the state of Israel. To say that they were displaced and not to say why or who. It was the State of Israel, that is indisputable. We can have the conversation about whether the should have been displaced elsewhere. 
	•	Alec: The refugees are them and their descendants. I think the language in the misleading, because 4 million were not physically moved. We need to get back to what the bill is about. 
	•	Matt: I don’t think that it matters what the number is. Getting hung up on this statement, this is not the point of this. We should have this dialogue separately. I think we should get rid of the whole statement. We should keep everything apolitical and maintain the point of free speech. 
	•	Serene: I’m hearing talk about political versus not political, but free speech is political. The number is pedantic, so I don’t think it’s that big of a deal to get rid of it. This is political and one sided, because any time SJP or related people do this, this kind of thing happens. Fliers happen all the time, it only happen to pro-Palestine voices. 
	•	Moira: As the authors and the sponsors we would be okay with getting rid of the numbers or including the citation. Because it does not give ASG support, but just says what the UN says. 
	•	Noah: We will now move to vote via preferential voting.  
	•	Motion to return to the rules. 
	•	Passes.
	•	Motion to extend Senate by 30 minutes. 
	•	Passes.
	•	Motion: to change it to “disrespects Palestinian identity and expression on campus”
	•	No objections. Passes. 
	•	PQ. 
	•	Voting on the bill as a whole. 
	•	Passes. 

Old Business: SR1415-03: Addressing Socioeconomic Status at Northwestern (see: Presentation) 
	•	Alec: With the last be it resolved, what do you mean by that and how do you envision that going forward? 
	•	Amanda: Essentially this is about living up to the reputation of our peer institutions. And because this is a resolution it does not compel the university to do anything, not that we could. 
	•	Ross: Motion to amend. I want it to read that: “Be it further resolved, that the undergraduate student body calls on the administration to use the percentage of undergraduate students on Pell Grants as one metric of success to be evaluated in 2020 at the latest.” Because I am against any quotas. 
	•	Isaac: This isn’t a quota, but just trying to increase our yield. This is not about letting people in, because admissions is need blind. It is more that Northwestern should make a greater attempt to get them to come here. I think it is important to put a hard number here and say as a student body that we want it to be higher and that this is the latest date it would be acceptable. 
	•	Ronak: Why 20%?
	•	Amanda: Because from an admissions standpoint and the financial burden of the university, it makes sense. It makes tangible sense to the University. 
	•	Austin: Everything in this has been discussed, so I like the idea of 20% or more. 
	•	Alec: Would you be open to an amendment clarifying the clause as it for yield and not admission?
	•	Isaac: No. 
	•	Grace: Motion to amend and add “or greater” after 20%. 
	•	PQ
	•	Passes. 
	•	We are now in discussion on this amendment. 
	•	PQ
	•	Passes unanimously. 
	•	We are now in discussion of the resolution as a whole. 
	•	Motion: I would like to add “while keeping admissions need-blind” at the end of the clause. 
	•	We are now in discussion of the resolution as a whole. 
	•	PQ
	•	Passes unanimously. 
	•	Good of the Order & Announcements
	•	Roll Call and Adjournment
