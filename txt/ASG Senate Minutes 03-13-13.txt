	•	Brad: If anyone's interested in getting involved with new student center stuff, let me know.
	•	Alex:  Besides my exec board report, thanks to Natalie. We will have therapy dogs on Saturday from 2-4 in the wildcat room! Come if you want to de-stress!
	•	Alexander: Puppies or big dogs
	•	Alex: Bigger dogs, don't want to hurt puppies!
	•	Siddiq: 2 non-senator positions open on the SAFC! If you know anyone interested or who would be good for the position, please forward it along.
	•	Neel: Recruitment! Will be losing half of the committee next year, will be sending out an application soon.
	•	Steven: Voter registration deadline has passed, we'll be finishing up plans for get out the vote stuff for the week after spring break. Will be having forums for the candidates tomorrow, please read my exec board report. Will be resigning soon. Free food, go there! Gun control outreach committee met, set deadline for sending letter out as first Wednesday back after spring break. Loyola and DePaul are behind it, trying to get in contact with U Chicago.
	•	Mark: Any sense for how many students registered to vote
	•	Steven: Don't have that info right now, but will be getting that information soon.
	•	Alexander: Why is this forum super important for elections
	•	Steven: Only opportunity to hear from both of the candidates, would be good to have students there to ask questions.
	•	David: A few things- CabCorner launched a couple weeks ago, will be ramping up publicity right around now- exclusive to Northwestern students and has utility for students going to and from the airport. Please forward a listserv blast after senate about it. BookSwap is officially live- please sell your textbooks using BookSwap! People won't use this if there aren't books there, so please use 10 minutes to post your books. Will also be doing another food truck festival with Spoon the first Thursday back.
	•	Alexander: Tried to use CabCorner the other night, but seems overly specific, and will only show those taking a cab from my street. Want a broader selection.
	•	David: Will communicate that- can't unilaterally change site since it's contracted out, but will see if it's feasible to implement.
	•	Ethan: I'M BACK! And BookSwap is launched. Will fix BookSwap, looks kinda nice, let me know what you think, shoot me an email, will be working more on the ASG website over Spring Break. Good luck on finals and have fun on Spring Break!
	•	Carly: The mentorship program is live, we're going to have a bunch of new student groups senators coming in, let me know if you want to get involved. Want to recognize Abby and Ian Coley as Senators of the Week for getting Election changes passed
	•	Mark: Open meeting of Sustainability Committee on Friday. I also have legislation tonight- please read it and vote for it. Divestment is being seen by university. Working on voluntary carbon market for university to incentivize responsible purchasing by the university.
	•	Ani: This is Brandon and I's penultimate Senate, will be making more changes as we leave our term for the next senate leadership team. Student group senators, keep in mind that if you're planning to serve another term and you get selected by the SGAC, the speaker will be meeting with you and your exec board to lay out responsibilities and expectations. Should hopefully improve accountability and transparency going forward.
	•	Mark: Requirements for running for a parliamentary body position?
	•	Brandon: Must have served as Senator for four consecutive Senates at any time.
II. Special Order: Director of Transportation Confirmation
	•	Alex: Selected Hayley Hinkle for Director of Transportation position
	•	Hayley: I'm a freshman that's been on student life since fall quarter, getting involved because I have background with transportation, will work as connection between university services and ASG.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Alexander: Point of Contact in administration?
	•	Hayley: Bernie Foster, other administrators that deal with shuttles
	•	Mark: This position includes oversight over both SafeRide and Shuttles, right?
	•	Alex: Yeah, those are the two main things.
	•	Ani: In line for endorsement period.
	•	X: Met with administration a few weeks ago, very happy to work with administrators.
	•	X: Also want to endorse Hayley, she's a really good pick.
	•	X: Definitely has what it takes.
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- passed. Hayley is confirmed as new Student Life Director of Transportation.
III. Special Order: Charles Stephens, ZipCar Presentation
	•	Charles: Thanks to all of you for the opportunity, will try to be quick. Zip car is a car sharing organization- it's a fleet of cars all over the world shared by millions of people. Operate in 20 major metropolitan areas, 2 continents, 30 campuses. Works fairly basically, but requires some explanation. Do a driving and credit check- once approved, make a reservation, wave card in front of windshield, drive away. Probably was the 4th or 5th person using my car that I used to drive here today. Launched in Chicago in 2006, largest car sharing company in Chicago, 550 cars in Chicago-land area, partnered with University in many different ways. In Evanston, we have 10 different cars in 7 locations. Good mix for right now. Parking is difficult, but trying to get closer to campus. If we can move forward in a 'Spirit of Partnership' can extend opportunity to use ZipCar to 18-20 year olds. Doing something at Northwestern would not be our first rodeo- 81% coverage of USNWR Top 15. This really works on campuses- spoke to John Cowgill, told me about how he gets $500 of parking tickets and wants to get rid of his car. We have partnerships with UChicago, UIC and DePaul. Would like to make this connection with Northwestern because I know it can work here.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Sean: For that 18-20 program, is the credit requirement the same?
	•	Charles: You definitely have to pass a credit check since we require credit cards, but not sure if we make different considerations for this group, but don't think so.
	•	Jamie: Any offerings for group offerings for use by multiple people?
	•	Charles: We have something like this, it's pretty unusual- we don't have a history of setting up business accounts, but probably could
	•	David: $8 per hour?
	•	Charles: Yes, and that's all inclusive
	•	Evan: If I run out of gas do I get reimbursed?
	•	Charles: Yes, need to bring back car with at least a quarter tank, have system to track it
	•	Carly: I used ZipCar in LA, do you anticipate prices going down to match LA's prices?
	•	Charles: Hard comparison between two different markets, but registration/membership fees are very much reduced for students.
	•	Carly: Do you see prices going down over time in Evanston?
	•	Charles: Hard to say, we need to modify our fleet and prices depending on area, can't really say how we'll make changes
	•	Ani: Can you tell us how students can be more involved in this discussion?
	•	Charles: Yeah, been in talks with administrators, construction is difficult point to discuss. The timeline for starting potential discussions is slated for April 2014 currently, would appreciate your support for finding alternatives that could get these cars in Evanston sooner.
IV. General Order: Election Commission Presentation
V. General Order: Code Review (Summary of Changes)
VI. New Business: SL1213-28: Budget Timeline Reform
	•	Brad: Currently, the code says the government shall submit the budget in winter quarter and Senate approves it. The reason that the budget selection has been pushed back for the past few years, is that the current deadline is arbitrary, has no impact during spring quarter. New administration has no say in budget currently. Codifying who sits on the committee that determines the budget. Gives input from all parties and is a well rounded group of people composed of both outgoing and incoming positions.  No downside to moving it back since budget doesn't take effect until fall quarter- would need to be approved by the last Senate of spring quarter, giving Senate more time to approve the budget.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Paul: I'm in favor of all this, but if we are breaking the rules now, why was this legislation not proposed a few weeks ago
	•	Brad: Me and Victor take the blame, misunderstood that it didn't have to be determined by the end of spring quarter
	•	Tori: If the incoming and outgoing administration don't agree, what will you do? How will you make sure the budget remains realistic.
	•	Brad: It's a vote- no position can push through an agenda without concurrence.
	•	Abby: This would all take place post-elections, would this include the current speaker?
	•	Brad: Would be the incoming speaker- didn't want even number of people.
	•	Mark: Motion to make this old business
	•	Mark: Seems like a majority of the objections are related to contingent aspects of it. Looking past the fact that Brad and Victor were overwhelmed, this is a good piece of legislation. We should pass this now, before Spring Break and should not continue to violate our own rules. We can flesh out the code-related issues when it's new business.
	•	Sarah (con): My thoughts on this is that it's a pretty big thing to change. We've only had a few hours to consider it and it only has one sponsor, it's too important to have considered for just a couple hours
	•	Alexander (pro): Was hesitant as well, but the way we do things now is bad, it's better to change
	•	Paul (pro): This is a mostly internal change, we always need to get constituent opinions, but I doubt our constituents will have much relevant input, and this is something we need to get done..
	•	Katie (pro): It's problematic that it's being proposed now, nothing to be gained by pushing it off further. Most people are supportive of this legislation, we should get this done
	•	Abby: Biggest objective was working with the new and old board but sounds like it'll work. Will just be changing things for the future anyway.
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is now old business.
 
	•	[Later]
 
	•	Brad: Sincerely apologize for missing the deadline, want to consider bill on individual merits,
	•	Victor: saw difficulties in planning Deering Days.
	•	Abby: Motion to amend that if one of the ad hoc committee members
	•	David: Amendment to
	•	Usually someone on executive board who's sat through multiple tenures, good for people who've seen multiple administrations.
	•	Doesn't make sense, understand reasoning, but someone's who's served as . Mandating that's it's the senior most member of executive board doesn't make sense
	•	Have to disagree, viewing the roles on the executive board narrow mindedly. Whole point is that as a representative of the executive board, speaks to cohesion generally, but rather viewed much more continuously.
	•	David (pro): Often use seniority in our decision making protocols, just not used on executive level too often
	•	Paul: not analogous, on the executive board, what the tech chair does is significantly different from what you do.
	•	Ian: PQ on Abby's amendment
	•	Passed. Amendment is implemented into the bill.
	•	Motion to previous question on the bill
	•	Passed. Legislation is approved.
VII. New Business: SR1213-14: Remembering Professor H. Paul Friesema
	•	Mark: This is a pretty straightforward piece of legislation, was instrumental to founding Northwestern's environmental program, responsible for donating thousands of physical Environmental Impact Statements, owned many books on Native American Policy and Culture that were donated to Smithsonian. Was great teacher that loved talking to students. The fact that he worked up to his death and that he continued to lecture through his 70s is amazing. He is an exemplary human being, had a passion for service and human rights. It's our responsibility to honor his life.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian H: About the last line, regulating that March 8th is day in his honor
	•	Mark: Hope that ASG adopts this every year going forward, and encourages the administration to do so as well.
	•	Serene: What ideas do you have for recognizing him on this day?
	•	Mark: Student groups involved with the environment would be hold events anyway and we should raise those events to increased relevance
	•	David: Two questions- Paul isn't first professor to pass away this year, procedure for honoring professors who pass away? Also, would you consider changing the date to his birthday
	•	Mark: Made more sense to us to do the death day, but open to changing this. There's no precedent of this that I know of, this will hopefully start a trend of remembrance and honor for other great individuals
	•	April: What contact have you had with NAISA?
	•	Mark: Emailed to Heather, haven't received response, but imagine they'd be supportive.
	•	Paul: Motion to make this old business.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Legislation is now old business.
	•	Ian H: Motion to amend to reflect that this day should be recognized annually and that the day honors his birthday (2/20/13)
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Amendments are now included in the bill.
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Legislation is approved.
VIII. Old Business: SL1213-27: LENDing a Hand
	•	Brandon: We will have an authorship speech from Ani.
	•	Ani: Good evening, I am the director of outreach for LEND (affiliated with the Farley Center). Our legislation requests 3,000 dollars for an ASG-named lending program for Evanston individuals and businesses without traditional avenues to funding. We empower these individuals and businesses with micro-loans. We establish connections with these entrepreneurs. We have account managers who visit with our clients on a monthly basis. We show that we are NU students who are reaching out and caring about the Evanston community. To review, this is not the first time LEND has come to ASG -- we came in March 2010, and ASG is considered a seed investor in LEND ($1,500). At that time, LEND did not have history and statistics to present -- just support from community members. We are coming back now with a much more successful program, a solid track record. We have contributed to 6 businesses, and have also helped over 25 other businesses through our business development services.
	•	Brandon: Questions?
	•	Brandon: Pro/Con?
	•	Alex: Con speech. This is almost half of the project pool. The project pool is supposed to be money from students, for students. I think it's great to reach out to the community, but I think this is the wrong source of that money right now.
	•	Ani: Pro speech. To address some concerns -- why now? Why ASG? LEND is facing unprecedented demand ($19,000 in request). We are cold-calling, reaching out to banks, we are trying very hard to meet this demand. The purpose here is to show that LEND is a strong organization, has support from the city of Evanston. When we talk with business owners and tell them that we're from Northwestern University and that we're here to help, it's about perception-changing. We are coming to ask for the establishment of a microloan program bearing ASG's name.
	•	Abby: Motion to amend to $1,500.
	•	Mark: Objection.
	•	Abby: I think this is a great idea, but $3,000 is a very significant portion of the project pool. I would love to at least match what we gave last time.
	•	Mark: Objection rescinded.
	•	Chris: Motion to amend amendment to have ASG match $2,000 if they can get $2,000 from another funding source so that LEND will have $4,000.
	•	Abby: Objection.
	•	Brandon: We are moving to debate on the amendment to the amendment.
	•	Brad: The project pool is about $4,900.
	•	Abby: Con speech. I am okay with $2,000, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with making them match that. I am fine with making the amount $2,000.
	•	Chris: I rescind the amendment and would like to amend to just $2,000 (without matching).
	•	Brandon: moving to a vote.
	•	Vote -- passed. Amended to $2,000.
	•	Brandon: moving to a vote on Abby's amendment.
	•	Vote -- passed. Amended to $2,000.
	•	Mark: Motion to amend. I think at the end of the 18-month period, the funds should be returned to the project pool and reconsidered for re-allocation.
	•	Brandon: Moving to debate on this amendment.
	•	Alex: This is getting too crazy. We're all going in different directions. The idea of this bill is to give a certain amount of money to LEND. At the end of the day, the fundamental question is whether or not this is the right source for this funding.
	•	Sarah: Question -- is it possible that at that point, LEND would not have the money to return if loans were out at that time?
	•	Ani: We keep a loan reserve on hand. We don't generally accept give-back programs because at that time, we might be faced with requests and be unable to give out loans at critical moments for Evanston businesses. We often have quick turnaround times for loans. We would also like to keep expanding.
	•	Sarah: Can LEND guarantee that the money could be returned?
	•	Ani: It's possible that it would be a problem -- we immediately turn around funds once they get repaid.
	•	Brandon: Pro speech on Mark's amendment?
	•	Paul: LEND gets money from other sources. I'm uncomfortable that we might be setting a precedent for LEND to be a line item out of ASG's budget. I don't like the idea of consistently giving away money from our project pool.
	•	Mark: I would like to clarify -- it would be a check-in point for Senate. The money could be returned or could remain in the pool. I want to build transparency between ASG and LEND. In the spirit of microfinance, I think we need to have an ability to reclaim our funds or let them remain in LEND's pool.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question.
	•	Alex: Objection.
	•	Ian: Rescind.
	•	Brandon: Con speech?
	•	Alex: I do not think that this idea is in line with the original purpose or intent of this legislation. This makes it too complicated. I think this should be an up-or-down vote on allocating the money. I don't know if LEND has the structure in place for this to be feasible.
	•	Ani: We would be open to extending to 24 months. We are run by donations. It is in the legislation that LEND would come back with regular updates. From a logistical standpoint, this could be very problematic for us.
	•	Brandon: Pro speech?
	•	Mark: Motion to amend to 12 months (down from 18 months).
	•	Seconded.
	•	Ani: 18 months is how long the maturation process is for a loan. We do not give out 12-month loans. Loans are paid back over the course of 18 months.
	•	Neel: Who would be responsible for the check-in?
	•	Alex: Motion to amend to 19 months.
	•	Seconded.
	•	Brandon: moving to a vote.
	•	Mark: Division.
	•	Vote -- passed. Reporting date on the amendment is now 19 months.
	•	Brandon: moving to a vote.
	•	Vote -- passed.
	•	Brandon: we are back to Mark's amendment on re-consideration of the funds after 19 months.
	•	LEND: Con speech. This is a risk because those funds could be allocated to a client at that time. We do not want a loan from ASG.
	•	Mark: I'm concerned about why your reserve capital is not adequate to ensure the possible return of $2,000.
	•	LEND: That money is for default on loans.
	•	Mark: But you're framing this in terms of it hurting someone in Evanston, which isn't the case.
	•	LEND: If we returned the $2,000, we would only have $3,000 in reserve.
	•	Mark: Pro speech. We need to have oversight on this money. I think if we have the ability to see the success play out, then this could be a worthwhile use of our money.
	•	Brad: Question -- if it was a $2,000 loan or $0, which would you prefer?
	•	Guarav: We do not want a loan. To speak to the point of oversight, we have a Board of Directors. We have a faculty advisor, a number of small business owners on the board. The chairman of the board owns a private equity fund in Evanston. So there is a ton of oversight.
	•	Siddiq: Is LEND an ASG-recognized organization?
	•	Ani: No.
	•	Mark: Exact wording of the amendment: After a period of 19 months, LEND will return to Senate with updates on their loan progress, and Senate will have the opportunity to continue the program or to request that funding be returned.
	•	Alex: Con speech. We have heard from LEND, and they do not want a loan. I think this is a bad idea overall.
	•	Dana: Con speech. I think the spirit of the legislation is to create a lending program, and this amendment is not in line with the spirit of the bill. I think it will detract from the good of the original legislation.
	•	Alex L: Question. Do you think it would be very difficult to do this in the 19-month timeframe?
	•	Guarav: Absolutely. This could leave LEND or the client hanging.
	•	Brandon: We are in line for a vote on Mark's amendment.
	•	Vote -- amendment fails.
	•	Brandon: We are back to the original legislation.
	•	Siddiq: Motion to amend. We need a stipulation that LEND has some quarterly on-campus programming.
	•	Brandon: We are in line for a con speech on the amendment.
	•	Alex: Con speech. This is getting too complicated.
	•	Abby: Con speech. LEND has a small overhead and would not have the funds for programming.
	•	Mark: Con speech. This would re-frame the entire context of the bill.
	•	Ani: We would love to bring back what we're doing to the student body at large. It's just difficult to do that because we're not ASG-recognized. We have had programming in the past that has been successful (co-spon with NCDC). We would be happy to have programming and to do it in conjunction with ASG.
	•	Guarav: Our average loan size is close to $3,000. Having events would cut into that funding. Something to consider.
	•	Alex: Question. Is there anything to be gained from putting this in the bill?
	•	Ani: We are planning to do this anyway. We try to keep publicity costs low. Putting this in the bill creates a different expectation.
	•	Brandon: We are in line to continue debating the amendment.
	•	Siddiq: Rescind amendment.
	•	Brandon: We are back to the original legislation.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question.
	•	Mark: Objection.
	•	Ian: Rescind.
	•	Brandon: We are in line for a pro speech on the entire bill.
	•	Abby: Pro speech. I recognize that this is a lot of money, but building stronger relations with Evanston is a good idea. We do not have to follow SAFC guidelines.
	•	Chris: Pro speech. Some people think this will not benefit students. The CR committee puts on events and programs that benefit students regardless of whether or not they are getting something tangible from them. For example, we are putting on a candidate forum. This is a long-term benefit to NU students. Improving relations with Evanston is very important.
	•	Mark: Con speech. I think this is a very irresponsible use of the SAF. I think LEND will find funding from other sources and will continue to do great work. This organization is not ASG-recognized, is rather young, and is asking for more money than most B-status organizations. I think there are others who will be willing to allocate money to this fund.
	•	Paul: Con speech. If we just spent time talking about making this relevant to students (through on-campus student programming), I do not think this is relevant to undergrads at NU.
	•	Tori: I think this sets a precedent that ASG donates to organizations. Where will we draw the line with donating to charitable organizations? We don't make donations.
	•	Neel: To give a non-ASG-recognized organization $2,000 is out of line.
	•	Ani: Pro speech. We understand that the SAF is a precious resource. The Senate recently created a Community Engagement Grant that benefited a few small groups of students that used that money in Evanston. NU is not an island. The SAF should not be treated as "play money" for students. We as students need to do something to build credibility with the Evanston community. That way, when we ask them for allowances, they are a bit more amenable to that, and they understand that students realize that they have a civic duty. ASG does make donations. Other groups like Mayfest have gotten "donations" from the project pool before. We are looking to build the credibility of the student body as a group of students that understand that they are not living in a bubble. We want to help entrepreneurs take their business to the next level. We work directly on the behalf of students to improve the reputation of NU and its students.
	•	Paul: Con speech. If LEND does not get this money, they will not just disappear.
	•	Siddiq: Con speech. LEND does great things, but why limit LEND's work to just its members? It would have a great impact on campus if LEND shared its information and experience with the NU community.
	•	Alex: Point of information -- could LEND ask for this money again in the spring?
	•	Ani: We are at liberty to come back to the project pool, but we are at an unprecedented demand right now.
	•	MCSA Senator: Other groups provide great opportunities for all students, but LEND does not. It is a select group of students handling community relations.
	•	Brandon: We are in line for a vote on the legislation.
	•	Brad: Division.
	•	Vote: 12-12-4 -- the legislation fails.
	•	Ani: Reconsider by secret ballot?
	•	Mark: Objection.
	•	Brandon: This is not debatable. We will move to a vote on whether to reconsider. This needs a majority.
	•	Brad: Division.
	•	Brandon: The motion to reconsider fails.
IX. Good of the Order & Announcements
	•	Northwestern drag show
	•	Alpha phi food philanthropy benefits Greek Build
	•	Alex: Evanston first ward candidate forum, will be moderating
	•	Victor: Happy St. Paddy's day on Saturday
