Meeting of the Senate
October, 8, 2014

	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	General Order: Welcome Residential Senators! 
	•	The new senators all took the oath! 
	•	General Order: Bicycling in Evanston
	•	Kevin: We have two guests tonight from the City of Evanston. 
	•	Ilda: I work for the City of Evanston, so welcome if you are new to the area - we are happy to have you here. I’m here to talk about a few quick things. I handle a lot of the transit issues the city deals with and work on our bike program, which is in its infancy. We did a city wide survey to poll our residents about transit. We were out at different facilities around the city asking people questions. I’ve been working with Kevin to try to get info from students as well, so please take the survey.  The goal is to gauge what is working and what isn’t for transit. The next steps for the transit survey is to present that to our parking and transportation committee and eventually to the council to provide guidance on what to do with that information. The third step is to work with transit partners on how to improve the bus system and if there is an opportunity to do anything with the purple line. Our bike program is new, but the objective is to work with our community partners and develop a campaign throughout the city that presents more biking safety and pedestrian and car safety. We are having some conflicts about lanes and what not, so one of the objectives this year is to start working on some outreach and working with a number of different community partners to talk about how to improve awareness about pedestrians and biking. We’re basically asking the university to continue to talk to us in terms of future bike lanes, improving safety and awareness and to stay active in what the city is working on. Our transportation and parking committee is where most of the conversation is going to happen this year. We also did some public commenting about the bike lanes this summer. The goal over the next year is to build a framework and to develop a better safety and awareness campaign and see if that is effective. We want to see if the city would need increased enforcement or if a bike ordinance would help. Evanston was awarded a 3 mil dollar grant to put up 8 bike sharing stations. We are determining the stations soon, we’ve done some analysis, but we’ll engage the committee to decide where they should go. We are looking to do a bike light giveaway soon, so keep your ears open for that! The tentative date is October 30th. Questions or comments? You can also contact me at bikes@cityofevanston.org
	•	Daniel: Most of my riding occurs on Sheridan Road. Has there been consideration of bike lanes there? 
	•	Ilda: There have! I don’t know about it for the short term, but last week the city council voted to postpone the bike lane suggestions. They are forthcoming, but not next year. 
	•	Kevin: We’ve been working on this and met with the aldermen in September and I can give you more information on where to voice your opinion. 
	•	Nicholas: What would the bike ordinance include?
	•	Ilda: I think it depends on the community engagement and awareness. It depends on what the problem is we need to solve, if we don’t need an ordinance to solve most of our problems, then we might not have one. But it is an option that we can consider. Some other cities have lesser fines for bicycle related things, right now the fine is the same as if you’re in a car. It really depends and we aren’t sure yet. 
	•	Nicholas: What do you think the problems are now? 
	•	Ilda: Motorists and bicyclists don’t know what the rules are and how they should be looking for bicyclists or if bicyclists are following all the traffic rules. 
	•	Nicholas: A big issue on campus is bike theft and it’s a big crime issue in Evanston. Is the city doing anything to fix that?  
	•	Ilda: I think it is something we should look at. Bike registration is important, but we have a low enrollment in our program. There is an opportunity to prevent a lot of that theft. 
	•	Kevin: Another big education thing is sidewalk usage. We are allowed to use sidewalks on campus and Sheridan, but it is not allowed in Evanston.
	•	Ilda: It’s only prohibited in the downtown districts, but it’s not really a safe option. We need to think about what those comfortable areas are and make it easier for everybody. 
	•	General Order: Community Relations Director of Technology Events Confirmation: Joji Syed
	•	Noah: Each exec member has a committee and if they want to restructure their committee and make people directors, then they need to present that person to the Senate and we can confirm them. 
	•	Kevin: CR Committee has never had director positions but have decided as a group to have them, especially focused on events. We do housing fairs, Cats Come to Dinner, etc. We do a lot of events and want to have one person that oversees those things. Joji has worked on a lot of those things already. 
	•	Joji: When Kevin reached out to me, I was very excited. I’ve worked on a lot of these events and I think I have the expertise and experience. I’ll aslo be coming in with a fresh pair of eyes and think of new ways to improve our committee. Hopefully you see me fit. 
	•	Isaac: Can you expand on the events you’ve run for CRC? 
	•	Joji: The biggest is definitely Cats Come to Dinner. You should all sign up, we are starting again soon. I also helped Chris with the Housing Fair last year. I also worked on consulting. Then there was the Holiday Bash in Evanston last summer. 
	•	Alex: Are you a part of any other committees?
	•	Joji: I am also on Alex’s committee, Student Groups. 
	•	Wendy: As director, how do you see your relationship with students and Evanston community, 
	•	Joji: My hope is to make everything more transparent and to make the communication for open ended. I want to facilitate students and student groups make connections with the community. 
	•	Chris: What is your title? 
	•	Joji: It’s just Events Director. 
	•	Chris: Can it be Director for Events? Also, what does it mean to you? 
	•	Joji: I want to be an accessible resource to all ASG members. If you don’t want to reach out to Kevin, you can reach out to me. Also I’ve been working with ASG for awhile and I want people to look to me as a mentor. I want this to be more than just a title. We can definitely help your student groups and your individual experiences.

	•	Will: Good at tabling his bias. Just have to trust him.
	•	Dana: Of course i’m biased - but that’s not how you approach things on rules. you’re there to make sure people nderstand it, have freqently passed legislation that i don’t agree with.

	•	New Business: SL1415-01 For NU(Ad)Ventures: Wild Ideas Fund
	•	Serene: Senate approved an allocation of $20,000 and now we need to establish the committee. The Wild Ideas committee, with be the EVP, VP of Student Activities, two people from SARC, FVP, VP of Student Groups and two general students. The way the process works once apps come in, the Wild Ideas Committee will look at them and see if it is feasible. The funding model at NU traditionally has only been available to events that have already happened before. We want this to be more accessible and not have too long of a turn around time. Senate’s voice is important, but we also want to minimize red tape. The $500 dollar amount follows from precedent. Our PR plan would be to push this really hard and with all your help. We would do that from facebook, online, and with fliers. 
	•	Xavier: What kind of ideas would this be? 
	•	Isaac: There are three criteria: enhance community, be available to all of campus, and be creative 
	•	Serene: This was inspired by the Project Pool and the 10K Initiative. 
	•	Alex: The 10K Initiative went for three years. The winners were WIFI on the lakefill, picnic tables and library chairs. 
	•	Erik: The idea is to promote something new on campus. 
	•	Bella: The three points that it has to meet, does it have to meet all three? 
	•	Serene: Yes, all three. There is a contract that says that also. 
	•	Bella: Do you fund food? 
	•	Alex: TBD
	•	Bella: Student Groups who are already getting funding for specific events, can they get additional funding here? 
	•	Erik: It depends what they need the extra funds for. If it is simply that they don’t have enough money then no, but if they want to change something and the nature of the event, then they could apply. This is mostly to create something new. 
	•	Serene: That is why we are including SGC and SAFC members on the committee. 
	•	Kenny: How would this apply to SASA’s project pool request last year? 
	•	Isaac: I think generally what we are trying to do is not get too specific in this legislation. The Wild Ideas Committee needs to look at everything holistically, so hypothetically yes, maybe? 
	•	Erik: Anyone can apply and if we say no, we’ll try to send them to other resources. 
	•	Bella: Will Senate know who is rejected as well as who is approved? 
	•	Serene: Right now it’s just approvals that come in. 
	•	Bella: How transparent is this committee going to be? 
	•	Serene: The committee can establish their own guidelines, but what is really important is that there are two representatives from campus. 
	•	Augustin: What happens when it is less than $500? 
	•	Serene: Just the Wild Ideas Committee is involved. 
	•	Kenny: What is the pool again? 
	•	Erik: It’s $20,000 with potential $5000 extra from the administration. 
	•	Erik: Motion to move to old business. 
	•	Noah: Is there a second? Yes. Any objections? 
	•	Johnny: I think this is too big to decide right now. This is a lot of money and it is theoretically possible to spend the whole fund without contacting Senate once. 
	•	Noah: We are now in debate on whether to move it to old business. Johnny counts as a con. We are now in line for a pro. 
	•	Serene: We talked about this in the spring a lot. If we want to talk about the $500 part we can talk tonight. We need to start the PR push now so that people can use it and that the whole campus knows about the fund. We can talk about it tonight. 
	•	Noah: We are now in line for a con. 
	•	Johnny: I understand that we talked about this a lot this spring but not everyone was there for those discussions. I understand PR, but what is one week. 
	•	Wendy: I think it is important to recognize that we are already on week 3. We want students to use this money and we want them to be able to learn about it. 
	•	Isaac: PQ
	•	Noah: Is there a second? Yes. We are now going to vote. 
	•	Noah: By my ear that passes. We are now moving this to old business. We are in line with a con speech on the legislation. 
	•	Amol: Motion to amend. I think the $500 should be decreased to $250. From last year, a lot of claims were under $500. I don’t like that most requests could just go through the committee. 
	•	Johnny: Motion to table for 15 minutes. 
	•	Noah: That does not pass. We are in line for discussion on the amendment.  We are in line with a con. 
	•	Moira: I was going to motion to do a different amendment. I think that if it is less than $500, then Senate will approve those as a slate and not individually. 
	•	Bella: I would say this is a good idea. I think that $500 is kind of high and like Johnny said, potentially they could continuously approve $500 over and over and then the money is gone. I think $250 is more reasonable. It is half of $500. I also think that there will be fewer proposals that are less than $250. 
	•	Lauren: I thought there was an option to present requests to the student body. Is that in there? 
	•	Serene: It’s not outlined, but the committee could. 
	•	Moira: If we keep the same guidelines but lessen to $250, we would have to discuss each individual item in Senate. It will take more time in Senate. 
	•	Augustin: This will still lessen the time and I don’t think we should just try to reduce the time in Senate. 
	•	: On average how much of a difference do you think this would make? 
	•	Alex: I don’t know, I think it is more about Senate’s comfort levels. 
	•	: It seems like a lot of people have issues with the amendment because of the time in Senate, so we could do what Moira suggested and pass a slate for $250-$500. 
	•	Isaac: I think the it’ll take longer talk, it’s our decision if it takes longer. It depends on us whether we think a proposal should have a lot of debate. 
	•	Moira: If it is over $500, does that mean the group comes in an present? 
	•	Serene: The Wild Ideas Committee would present, not the actual groups. 
	•	Alex: We noticed student groups would be bombarded at Senate and it was not the best atmosphere, so the Wild IDeas Committee will advocate on behalf of the group. 
	•	Wendy: I think it is important to remember the purpose is for wild ideas. We want students to be able to bring out their ideas. I should not be that complicated of a procedure for them to get the money. I think $500 is not that much. And we need to have trust in our committee. 
	•	Noah: That ends debate period. We will now vote. A yes vote would change the amount to $250, no is to leave the legislation as is. 
	•	Division
	•	Favor: 10, Opposed: 15, Abstained: 2
	•	Noah: The amendment fails, it will remain $500. We are now debating the legislation and we are in line for a con. 
	•	Bella: If the money isn’t used fully does it roll over? 
	•	Serene: Yes. 
	•	Moira: Motion to amend. Any application that the Wild Ideas Committee approves under $500 would have to be approved as a slate in Senate and anything above $500 would be considered individually. 
	•	Chris: Is this going to be presented as a general order? Wouldn’t that mean it would always be a slate, so this would require not a slate for above $500. 
	•	Serene: The way the language currently stands the Wild Ideas Committee could present everything as a slate anyways. I don’t think above or below $500 needs to be different. 
	•	Isaac: I motion to table this for a week. 
	•	Any objections: 
	•	Wendy: Yes. I think that the purpose of Wild Ideas is to facilitate this for students. 
	•	Isaac: As an author I think it is important to table this, because the language is unclear. If we want to make rules, then we should make sure that they are really clear. 
	•	Kenny: I get that and we should try to make this great, but I know student groups that are waiting. We should PR this regardless of what this looks like. We need to make sure students know there is money if they have good ideas. The issues can be worked out later. 
	•	Noah: We are now going to vote on the motion to table. 
	•	Favor: 8, Opposed: 16, Abstained: 1
	•	Noah: That fails, so we are now back in discussion. We are in line for a con. 
	•	Serene: The way that this legislation was presented it could be that everything was proposed as a slate above $500. Why not just divide things as need be? 
	•	Daniel: Can you explain what a slate is? 
	•	Noah: Everything would be presented at once and voted on together. 
	•	Wendy: Is it a general order? 
	•	Noah: It would be a special order. 
	•	Moira: Motion to amend. Can you change it to be could be individually instead of would be? That way they are not obligated to make it individual. 
	•	Noah: This is now the amendment we are discussing. We are in line for a con on the amendment. 
	•	Ruba: When it says unilaterally approved, does that mean Senate doesn’t hear about the ones that are under $500. 
	•	Serene: The committee would not have been obliged to present. 
	•	Erik: Anything over $250 is included in my exec board report. 
	•	Serene: I don’t think it needs to be outlined specifically since dividing is part of procedure. 
	•	Ruba: We want to be aware of the funding. We just want to make sure it is presented in Senate. 
	•	Johnny: I think the new amendment just erased the distinction between above and under $500. 
	•	Noah: Debate period is now over. 
	•	Kenny: Is there a motion to general discussion?
	•	Noah: You can move to extend debate period. 
	•	Kenny: I move to extend debate period by 5 minutes. 
	•	Noah: We are extending debate. 
	•	Moira: I think it would be helpful for the committee to have to present all the under $500 at once. 
	•	Bella: I think to echo Serene, this is something that could easily happen with regular Senate procedure. 
	•	Ruba: This is not pointless or repetitive, because without this amendment, we won’t see projects that are under $500. 
	•	Bella: We had a chance earlier to reduce it to $250 and we chose not to, if $500 is the question. 
	•	Noah: We will now vote. 
	•	Division: 
	•	Favor: 13, Opposed: 13. The amendment fails. 
	•	Will: Motion to reconsider. 
	•	Johnny: Motion to roll call. 
	•	Noah: The motion fails, 14 to 14. 
	•	Motion to amend. Anything under $150 automatically passed, anything $150-$500 would be presented as a slate, and anything above $500 could be considered individually. 
	•	Serene: I think the slate differentiation is not necessary and is confusing. 
	•	Isaac: Motion to amend. Anything under $150 can be passed by the committee without Senate approval, anything $150-$500 would be presented but not voted on and anything above $500 would be voted on. 
	•	Noah: We are in line for a con. 
	•	PQ
	•	Noah: If you vote in favor we will alter the amendment. That passes. We are now discussing this amendment. 
	•	PQ
	•	Noah: We will now vote on the amendment. That passes. Now we are in line to vote on the legislation. 
	•	Passes unanimously. 
	•	New Business: SL1415-02 C.R.E.A.M. : Student Leadership Stipend Committee
	•	Erik: Last spring we approved $10000 to fund a student leadership stipend program. Students with a demonstrated financial need have a barrier to participating in leadership positions. This is just approving the committee structure and saying that the EVP can select the committee. I would serve as the chair and pull together members from across the student body, not just ASG. This committee is going to meet this year, but not continue on later. 
	•	Johnny: The members will all be appointed by EVP? 
	•	Erik: Yes. 
	•	Moira: Would it count as a committee requirement? 
	•	Dana: Nope. 
	•	Kenny: Does this committee have the final say on who gets the awards? 
	•	Erik: No. As soon as financial aid is considered, students are blind to the process. This is for the merit process and checking to see what the responsibilities of their positions are. 
	•	Noah: That ends the question and answer period. 
	•	Good of the Order & Announcements
	•	Roll Call and Adjournment
