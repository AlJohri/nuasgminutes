Meeting of the Senate

	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	General Order: Divvy Biking Survey
	•	Noah has not taken this survey. 
	•	General Order: Student Group Senate Seat Apportionment 
	•	Andrew: As you guys hopefully know, there is a student group caucus. We review that caucus every year and the groups that are represented. It is a very important process. We are starting that process. The reason I am presenting it, it requires a majority vote from Senate. Basically they will be due and we will spend a week interviewing and then present to Senate. There is a link in the agenda that has similar questions to what we will be asking. 
	•	Passes unanimously. 
	•	New Business: SL1415-12 Amendment to Mental Health Working Group
	•	Chris:  Just wanted to check in with you all. If you remember 6 weeks ago I asked to create a working group to determine the mental health landscape of campus. We met twice before break and then the exec board got caught up in other things. Rather than rushing, we want to push it back and give you feedback by the end of the quarter. 
	•	Chris: Motion to move to old business. 
	•	Isaac: Objection. I just want to remind you of when you wanted to rush this project. 
	•	Ariel: If it is supposed to be presented, then what happens if it does not get moved to old business?
	•	Chris: I will stand up here and make something up. 
	•	Alec: It doesn’t matter either way. 
	•	Isaac: Withdrawn. 
	•	Noah: We will hear it at the end. 
	•	PQ
	•	Passes unanimously. 
	•	New Business: SL1415-13 Amendment to ASG Feedback Working Group
	•	Chris: If you remember 6 weeks ago I asked to create a working group to determine ASG’s impact on campus. We met twice before break and then the exec board got caught up in other things. Rather than rushing, we want to push it back and give you feedback by the end of the quarter. 
	•	Chris: Motion to move to old business. 
	•	No objections. 
	•	PQ
	•	Passes unanimously. 
	•	New Business: SL1415-14 Name Changes and Code Cleanup
	•	Erik: Basically this is to make sure the code is actually updated. Sometimes legislation might not cover the entire part of the code it impacts, sometimes the code does not reflect our practices, etc. There are many changes, but they are summed up in the points in the principle. The most notable thing is changing the SAFC and the SGC to the A-Status Finances Committee and the B-Status Finances Committee. It would also change the name and abbreviations. You also may remember when we passed the Analytics committee it was an ad hoc committee, so we are going to codify that. We are removing the Operations Committee, because it does not exist. We are removing the VP of Technology and instead having a Director of Technology position under the Chief of Staff. The rest and also the Constitutional Amendment parts are adding things that were parts of legislation in the past. 
	•	Isaac: There is a part under the A-Status that says all funding requests need to go through A-status, so maybe look at that? 
	•	Motion to remove forum. 
	•	No objections. 
	•	New Business: SR1415-07 Active Consent on College Campuses 
	•	Petros: Active Consent, Affirmative Consent, whatever you want to call it, is a concept that requires that you get explicit confirmation before sexual activity. California recently passed a law requiring all college students on campuses receive active consent. I’m going to read from the law, “ “Affirmative consent” means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. It is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure that he or she has the affirmative consent of the other or others to engage in the sexual activity. Lack of protest or resistance does not mean consent, nor does silence mean consent.” It also includes other provisions, like about alcohol. I am asking that ASG encourage the Illinois General Assembly to pass a similar law. 
	•	Lauren: So you can’t consent at all if you’re the least bit intoxicated? 
	•	Petros: The CA law says the accused cannot claim consent if asleep or unconscious, or if the complainant was incapacitated due to the influence of drugs, alcohol, or medication, so that the complainant could not understand the fact, nature, or extent of the sexual activity; or the complainant was unable to communicate due to a mental or physical condition
	•	Johnny: Is there a reason why this is limited to college students? 
	•	Petros: I wrote it that way because there is precedent in CA. Ideally that would apply to everybody, but this is precedential. 
	•	Christina: Does this require lobbying? 
	•	Dana: No, but they can use it as a tool. 
	•	Old  Business: Election Guidelines Review
	•	Dana: most of this is the same as last week but we’ve taken some htings into condisideration. 3 things wev’e changed are the timelline: candidates can start their campaign on the second day of classes; the end of the election peroiod is the following friday, approx. 10 days. Another thing we changed ts that we extended the amount of time students can vote. The election period will end april 10, and there weill be a 24hr voter period. WE also adjusted flyering, so that only 600 are allowed. The final change from last week is to adjust voting booths so that they can only be set up y the election commission. Everything else is the same - on thing we didn’t change is that election committee will be in conjunction with the services committee. 
	•	Noah: Questions?
	•	C: can you clarify why you chose the voting period?
	•	Dana: before it was midnight to 7pm. we thought b/c voting was on a friday it woud be good if they had thursday to vote as well.\
	•	Noah: we will now enter dbate
	•	PQ
	•	Seconded
	•	Voting:
	•	“Aye”
	•	Noah: that passes
	•	passes unanimously
	•	Noah: next we will move into our next piece of old business SR1415-6
	•	Old  Business: SR1415-06: Resolution on Student Conduct Hearings
	•	Jonathan: Are any other schools adopting similar resolutions? 
	•	Julia: All the other schools at the Big 10 Conference will be having similar resolutions. 
	•	Noah: Moving in to debate period. 
	•	PQ
	•	No objections. 
	•	Passes unanimously. 
	•	Old  Business: SL1415-11: Off-Campus Election Code Changes
	•	Basically it will be attached to the presidential ballot, students will say where they are going to live the following year - we think someone planning to live off the next year can serve in the off-campus caucus and vote accordingly, since they will be living off for most of their term - off-campus students will be sent to ballot with the election guidelines. 
	•	Alec: How does that relate to the Election Commission? 
	•	Noah: You cannot be on the Election Commission if you are running. 
	•	Grace: What is the campaigning policy? 
	•	Noah: It is not specifically outlined. 
	•	Isaac: What is your response to the fact that this is happening at the same time as the election, and it is possible for candidates to stack a slate of eight senators underneath them. 
	•	Noah: I am not concerned about that. If a candidate is doing that, they could be impeached. 
	•	Grace: If you are on a campaign, do you get an unfair advantage? 
	•	Noah: I don’t think so. 
	•	Petros: In terms of filling vacancies, nothing is changed? 
	•	Noah: No. 
	•	Grace: If not enough people run, what happens? 
	•	Noah: It’s not outlined in this code change, but I’d imagine it would be the same as when Residential elections are not competitive. 
	•	Grace: Wouldn’t it reflect poorly if nobody ran? 
	•	Noah: I don’t think so. I think it reflects more poorly that everyone in the current caucus is appointed. 
	•	Alec: Motion to amend. Motion to add “The Election Commission will write and review rules specific to the Off-Campus election and will administer the elections.” to the end of code. 
	•	Grace: Why are we choosing the Election Commission? 
	•	Isaac: Bureaucracy. 
	•	Nehaarika: I think it’s necessary that it should be somewhat similar to what we have for residential senators. 
	•	Grace: I don’t think it should be the election commission who writes the rules, because it would really limit who could serve who could serve on the Election Commission. 
	•	Nehaarika: Does that mean people on the Election Commission cannot run for Residential Senators? 
	•	Noah: In the past they have resigned before that election.
	•	Isaac: This doesn’t mean if you want to be a residential or off campus senator you can’t be on the election commission, but for those given elections you cannot serve. 
	•	Grace: Motion to amend. Instead of the Election Commision. An Off-Campus Election Commision with four people from the Election Commission, the Election Commissioner, and two other elected students. 
	•	Petros: We got rid of an extra commission because it was bureaucratic. If you want to run for a position, it should take precedence over the Election Commission. 
	•	Grace: I think we as students can prioritize running for a Senate position and being on the Election Commission. Students should have the opportunity to do both. 
	•	Isaac: Here is my thing here. I don’t agree with your points, but I can see why they are worth having. I think we should pass this because we are not debating the meat of the amendment Alec brought up and then you can bring that up later as a separate code change. 
	•	PQ
	•	Does not pass. 
	•	PQ. 
	•	Passes. 
	•	PQ. 
	•	The legislation passes unanimously. 
	•	Roll Call and Adjournment
