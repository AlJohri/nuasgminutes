	•	Claire: ASG is in Homecoming!  We have a banner.   You all should participate!  If you’re interested, meet at 7:30pm in the ASG exec office.  Dress in purple
	•	Claire: Secondary Teacher Award.  We are starting an award where seniors nominate really influential secondary teachers. 
	•	Ethan: We had a meeting with off-campus administrators today—there is a big forum Tuesday in Tech auditorium, 7pm, in part to discuss off-campus issues, complaints of Evanston about NU students, etc.
	•	Claire: For one day, Northwestern is partnering with US Empowered to sponsor a minority student.   You should all sign up!
	•	Tyris: Wants to highlight a few important things.  Funding is coming up.  Go to the ward meeting.  Wildcat Tailgate.
	•	Claire: Tomorrow night we are having a training session for the NSC ground-team.
	•	Special Order: UBPC
	•	Anil: Is the chair of UBPC.
	•	Introductions
	•	Anil: We try to make northwestern a better place by requesting money for things that students care about.  We request money from the president, provost, and senior administration.
	•	John: seven person committee that involves UBPC and ASG president.  We have an open poll in the fall quarter to brainstorm ideas from undergrads to figure out what they want.  At the end of winter quarter, we send another poll.  Then we submit a report to administrators.  We want to be an avenue for you and your constituents to the University administration. 
	•	Anil: We’re all here for the same reason: To make northwestern a better place.  If you guys come up with ideas, please reach out to us—you have your chance to voice your opinion.
	•	We just created a campaign, “if you had unlimited funds, what would you change about northwestern?”  We wanted to talk to you guys about this generally.  Please respond, tell your constituents about this.  We will have an open forum November.
	•	Questions?
	•	Q: How much funding do you have?
	•	A: We don’t start with a particular amount of money, we just provide recommendations for the university administration.  And they decide which things to fund and which things not to.
	•	Q: Are you working with the NSC initiative?
	•	A: The NSC has been at the top of our list for 5 years.  We will continue to look into that issue this year.
	•	Q: Do you choose ideas based on the popularity of the idea?
	•	A: We try and be statistically accurate as possible while being realistic about it.  There is some degree of discretion.
	•	Go take the poll online!
	•	Special Order: Funding Presentation
	•	Emma: The room will look a little different, make sure to bring your packets.  Beyond that, thought that it might be useful to go through an appeal round.  We will have a randomized “cut round” anyone who would like a cut in their group will raise their hand.  Will move to a “add round,” groups can petition to give money.  Debates will ensue.  You can petition to extend the debate if you want to hear more/have more debate.  Then will move to a vote.
	•	Tyris: Be prepared.  Supplemental will probably take a little longer than a usual meeting.
	•	Q: How do I find information about past funding?
	•	Emma: This summer we put up a new website that has information about past funding.  Just search SAFB northwestern.  [It will also be emailed out].
