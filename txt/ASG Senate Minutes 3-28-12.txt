	•	Parliamentary Body Elections
	•	Wilson: For the speaker; can nominate yourself
	•	Neil: Nominate Aaron
	•	Aaron: I accept
	•	Paul: I nominate Ani
	•	Ani: I gratefully accept
	•	Mark: Please describe the duties of Speaker
	•	Wilson: (lists some tasks)
	•	Wilson: Nominations are closed; 5 minute introduction speech.  Question period no more than 10 minutes.
	•	Ani: All I learned to do in Medill was tell stories.  Today, I will tell you my story, because it has a lot to do with why I’m here.  Coming to Northwestern was about finding a family I could be part of rest of my life.  Figured I needed to experience as much as I could do.  Asked myself if this was the best way to go.  Over the past two years, come to see ASG and Senate as very real channel with which to connect to community.  It has the potential to be central hub of community that is decentralized.  As member of Katie’s student life committee, my first project was mailrooms.  I’ve been behind the scenes of housing ordinance—been on front lines with talking with admin about resources.  Let me translate in terms of speaker.
	•	Aaron: Hi everyone!  Freshman year, I was a student groups senator representing Hillel.  Did rally towels for tailgate—most successful ever had.  Served on senate reform committee.  Throughout this entire process, wanted to make sure Senate was about efficiency and getting things done.  this year, I became IFC senator.  I can bring balance between efficiency and fun.  It’s more important to make sure other senators have their voices heard.  I have matured greatly and am really proud about job I’ve done in Greek Caucus.
	•	Wilson: Questions
	•	Amalia: Who do you think the Speaker answers to?
	•	Ani: Senate
	•	Aaron: Obviously Queen Amalia.  No, as I said before, Speaker not only answers to Senate, but to students at large.
	•	Victor: Role of speaker in recruitment
	•	Aaron: feel it’s very important to be complete exec effort in summer and in the fall a complete Senate attempt.
	•	Ani: Feel speaker needs to be well-connected to community because recruitment needs connections: 1) plugged in 2) recruitment doesn’t end once they’re accepted; it is about training.
	•	Matt: What do you think the single biggest problem with Senate is?
	•	Ani: purpose, mission, sense of camaraderie; any student group, we are a student group to a large extent, to feel together.
	•	Aaron: Neil example
	•	Ian: Motion to extend by one question; How would you deal with exec members acting out in Senate?
	•	Aaron: exec board reports?  Senate is senate—exec more on long-term goals. Senate on short-term.
	•	Ani: I disagree—senate is not short-term body.  Exec should be held to same standard as Senators.
	•	[Candidates leave for discussion period.  Comments below are without names but made by people present]
	•	Emphatically for Ani—he possesses proper talent, disposition for this role.  Commands respect.  Involvement is extensive and deep.  More than anyone, he has things to speak for because he knows what to expect.  Exactly the kind of person we need in this position.
	•	I’ve seen four speakers at Northwestern now and I could say that if Ani is not elected tonight it would be a travesty.  ASG would be at a loss with him without Speaker.  I want you to think about the future of ASG.  Consider the freshmen who are coming in next year and you are coming to an ASG orientation session or Senate and this is your first exposure to ASG, who do you want up there representing ASG.  Ani has the right temperament, patience; he is a doer.  When Senators come to him with questions, he knows where to point them.
	•	One of the first things I did was join the Election Commission and it was because Ani really encouraged me and I think that is important in senator training.
	•	Wilson: The Winner for Speaker is Ani Ajith.
	•	[Ani is sworn in.]
	•	Wilson: Senate is never going to be a useful and effective body unless you are right there pushing each other.  The ball is in your court.  It’s been fun.  So long and thanks for all the fish!
	•	Ani: Nominations for Parliamentarian are now open.
	•	Motoki: I nominate Brandon.
	•	Brandon: I accept.
	•	Ani: You have five minutes to give your speech.
	•	Brandon: I joined Senate when I was a sophomore.  I found rules committee to be one of the best commitments I’ve taken as a Senator.  It teaches you about how Senate works and gives you a chance to work with Senators from all four caucuses.  It is a way to work with Senators to know what they’re doing as far as the Parliamentary process goes.  I want better utilization of the Rules Committee.  We can use out time better—different Senators come in and learn how to write legislation.  I would love to be Parliamentarian for the upcoming year.  I have served on numerous election commissions.
	•	Ani: ten minutes for questions.
	•	David: One of the most important roles is to act as organization’s disciplinarian.  Are you comfortable with that?  How aggressive would you be?
	•	Brandon: It is difficult talking to Senators and sort things out.  We like to sort things out before it comes to that.  If it does come to that, I feel comfortable leading the committee.
	•	Ian: Time commitment.  Can move schedule around to account for exec, rules, etc.
	•	Ani: Question period is closed.
	•	Matt: Motion to suspend the rules and white ballot.
	•	Ani: All in favor of white ballot.  Motion passes.  Congratulations sir, you have been white balloted.
	•	David Chi: [Campaign Speech]
	•	Paul: Motion to white ballot.  The Ays have it.
	•	Ani: Congratulations, you have been elected Treasurer.
	•	[Josephine Lee Swears David Chi as ASG Treasurer]
	•	Ani: Elections for Clerk.
	•	[5k Committee Update]
	•	Transportation Working Group Update
	•	Ani: And now we have a general order about the working group for transportation
	•	Katie: We were using 
	•	Victor: So we have compiled a working list of contacts. We are also using data from an IE presentation because we can’t do it alone! We are proposing that e lobby  for increased funding for saferide, and database integration. 
	•	Katie: The shuttles also want us to look for quality assurance riders, and address the feasibility of adding stops and 
	•	Victor:
	•	Ian: To what extent are you guys considering sustainability?
	•	Victor: Safety comes first, but the saferides are priuses (priuii?)
	•	Mark: Could I join..as an interested senator concerned with sustainability?
	•	Victor: Sure
	•	Ani: Great! Great 
(Roll Call)
Ani: quarum, motions on the floor, moving to new business. 
Victor: senator training, conducted senator sureys, rules committee is an integral part of senate that has a big role. It follows that, it would make sense or rules committee to hold traiing sessions for new senators. Rules committee has the time for it and Brandon is on board, that’s the first one. 
Ani: Any questions?
Victor: It would take one session to go over the basics, ideally we would want a senator to submit the legislation before the first meeting. I don’t for see it being more than that. 
Mark: What are your ideas for the punishment for missing the training
V: up to the committee
PHA: when would this start?
V: up to the committee
Ani: moving onto the SL73 Senator Handbook
V: a vary broad knowledge of ASG, not centralized resource that teaches senators to do their job, this has 7 different sections
M: this is something that the dorm senators have been talking about for a quarter, senators have no idea what their doing or what has been done. imagine this to be a binder passed down that will have everything you need to know as a senator. Bullet points identified by RHA RCB caucus. 
V: how this handbook would be written: we think the caucus whips should be a part as well as VP parliamentarian and speaker of the senate because they do the internal operations of senate and they oversee it. 
RHA: any plans in place to institutionalize this hand book?
V: we can add that this is updated by rules (annually)
Matt: do have copies of the former handbook?
Victor: Yes
Ian: you have a member of exec and whips in charge, what kind of discipline do you have in place if they fail to produce a draft
V:that would be on the team to come together, the extent of the measures we do have are that it has to be approved by senate. The second draft will also need approval.
V: preferably we will move it up so we can start get it moving
Ian: are those people on board that would be required to be involved
V: I havnt asked them. We can keep this old business. 
Dan: we had an online constitutioal forum, the last senate there was an amendment to strike, what came up out of the forum, allow the election commission to set a date at their own discretion. I would be open to any friendly amendments. Equal opportunity to campaign during the campaign period. Allow students to observe the campaign period. 
Aaron: but back the clause about the 3rd week of the quarter with the committee to reserve the right to change the date, any questions
Mark: put the election in a situation where they can be influenced by candidates, assuming direct contact btwn commission and candidates
Dan: there is already this interactions, we can trust the public servants to act responcibly becauses that is what they have been selected to do.
Aaron: we elect these senators, if you are not in agreement don’t pass it. 
Mark: in that case I propose the amendment have a deadline
Matt: ASG suffers from lack of constitutional memory, since precedent is to have it on the third week is there something we can do to ensure that the 3rd week is strongly recommended. 
Dan: you are welcome to make a friendly amendment to insure that
Aaron: this is the amendment
Austin: it says the Pres and VP… the academic VP and student life VP, but theoretically the election commission could choose not to set a date
Dan: could set in stipulation that an election must occur. 
Aaron: not changing any assumptions 
Steven: potentially clarifying question, do you think its necessary to set a date as a minimum, what Austin was alluding to, an extreme situation, do you think it is necessary to ensure there is a final date set. 
Aaron: there is no point in doing something you dont know until it is finalized. I think that is in the code, I don’t think its fare to put in a specific date. We just want a clause that can allow a change to happen. 
Dan: I personally think we need a date? No, because I trust the discretion. If you think it is necessary I anticipate this round of amendments. 
Brad: what this amendment is proposing, it does not specify the date that THIS election will be occurring, because the date is passed for this year, would this election be subject to this. 
Dan: I believe the committee can supersede this
Groups: it has the dates set, 
Ani: there are actual dates that need to be changed
Dan: now the constitution would change this
Groups: if we change it, the change has to be approved by senate so there is still a check on the committee that is senate. we don’t have to change it but if they did it would have to be approved by senate
Ani: the election commission guidelines would have to be brought back up and approved by senate, is this a fair interpretation. 
Brad: because they have to ability to set the date, in order to bring that amendment up we would have to bring that up tonight, to what point would the election committee feel comfortable doing this
Ash: realistically how long does the election committee need to do this
Election commissioner: I want this to be done by senate, not to be left by the committee. as they are written now, petitions are due on Friday. must be due tonight 
Motoki: is this amendment solely for this cycle or for the future
Dan: for the future as well
Steven: as the amendment is read now, is there anything that prevents the commission from being amended multiple times? is there any protection against that, if not is that an issue?
Dan: there is a protection, 
Tori: for what reasons do you deem it acceptable to change the date
Dan: equal opportunity to all candidates, precedent by NU, delayed Welcome Week to accommodate Yom Kippur. Accommodating all religious beliefs. 
(extend question period)
Tori: hypothetically assume holiday overlaps with every holiday, how do you determine which holiday is most important?
Dan: there is a limited number of candidates, were asking for the ability to observe the holidays they feel obliged to observe. There is a limited amount of holidays that can be observed by candidates. 
Daniel: this has never come up in the past. Why does your choice, have to affect the constitution of ASG
Dan: all students should be able to run for ASG because of a neutral scheduling block. I don’t think it should be a burden placed on me to give up on campaigning so I can practice Easter
Daniel: others have to make choices all the time. 
Aaron: this is a different, matter, he cannot change it. 
Ani: lets not make this a back and forth
Ani: in response to the amendment, if they pass senate has the power to reconsider the power an senator could motion to reconsider. at that point you can make amendments. great
Ani: debate period, pro speeches
Tori: hi guys, I see many things wrong with this amendment, this hasn’t been an issue in the past, should have been brought up last quarter. What religion is more important? Shabbat is every Friday. If they are elected, they will have to make this choice all the time. Having the time that the election is now, it is before midterm season, it is optimal for the student body. This will only benefit the candidates and not the student body, we already have a hard time, the turnout is already not very great
Ani: pro speech
Motoki: in this debate we should not be focused on whether or not this thing will change the election cycle. We should focus on in the future if this comes up do we want senate to debate this again. I wont comment on this cycle, in the future, should we have the power to change this
Dan: It would take place in the 4th week, not the 5th or 6th, if you say academics are more important than allowing students to observe religious beliefs, I find that concerning, It was brought up in the past. This is your time you decide what you want to do. 
Ani: the senate shall approve the day of the election. Senate, already has this power if you want to consititutionalize this you can.
Matt: we aren’t debating the amendment itself
Ani: we are debating whether this amendment should be made. We are in the last pro con round. is there a con speech. 
Satirios: people are having trouble with whether or not it is set in stone, completely unnecessary, if you cant handle this, if youre not youre not doing your job. Were figuring out a way to figure out the hypothetical. 
Ani: in motion to vote:
(Passed)
this is now the proposed amendment to debate
Mark: I want one week to allow the committee to speak with the candidates. 
Groups: the way it is now, the date will have to be set by the time the elections  guidelines are passed. 
Ani: largely up to the discretion of the election committee. 
Ani: the date of the election has to be in the guidelines. 
Aaron: amend the line to say “by the end of winter quarter” the day of the election
Ani: now in line to debate the election. 
Ian: motion to amend the amendment: …
Ani: is there any debate for this? pros or con? PQ?
Fransis: we wont be able to change the date if this passes?
Steven: we would theoretically have to approve it, yes.
Ani: there is a decision, parliamentary interpritation, if this amendment passes, the amendment to approve the day of the elections. then senate would be bound to not be able to change the day. 
Ian
Ani: this doesn’t leave any room for senate to revise the guidelines. We are in line for a pro speech. in line for a vote, to delete the “day of the election and”
(passes)
now we are in line for debate. debating the last sentence
Mark: motivation is straightforward, addresses flexibility to discuss w potential candidates. unfortunate the new amendment wouldn’t apply to this election cycle, this is appropriate, a fair compromise, Ian agrees
Aaron: after speaking to francis, the way the language is written, senate is at a bind forcing senate to approve something by the end of winter quarter, I would like to amend it to say, “presented to senate by the end of winter quarter”
Ian: doesn’t senate defacto pass the guidelines by the end of winter quarter
Austin: they bring forth the guidelines by winter quarter
Ian: pro, given that senate generally passes these guidelines by the end of quarter, we are putting into words what we already do, this also solves many of the problems Dan presented, we don’t have to deal with technicalities. in coming years we will have to deal with the election in the future, not necessarily for religious reasons. Lets move away from this being a religious reason. 
Matt: con, everybody knows were talking around the real issue. Dan brought it up 4 weeks ago, we drowned him in all this crap about changing the constitution. what is at issue here to be discussed. Lets talk about we can change the election this year by one week. This has been a rant
Mark: just to address your point Matt, I think you’re right, this is an issue that we should address. I wish the election wasn’t in two weeks, we cant be inconsistent , we have to oblige ourselves to the rules we have agreed to. we have to address the pertinent issue that there are only 2 weeks. 
Ani: con?
Dan: I want to provide for the future under the understanding that we don’t harm the present, abide by your laws but that doesn’t mean you cant change them. I don’t think you are bound, I hope the student government is not bound by its laws. I cant say any more that hasn’t been said. 
Ani: what we are debating is the last sentence. we are now in line for a PQ on this amendment. all in favor of the last line
(passed)
Ani: in round for 3 rounds of pro con on this text as it stands: 
Aaron: change approved to presented
(division)
(did not pass)
Ani: in line for pro con, there is a motion to change wording to make sense. 
Mark: this leaves a lot of room for ambiguity, blatant inconsistency, some extraneous information, its what our intent is, it just has to be codified
Ani: motion to PQ, motion to extend senate 15 minutes.  we will now vote on whether to vote on extending. 
(passed)
we are now ending at 10 45
roll call
quarum is filled
Ani: in line to debate this amendment, all in favor to approve, 
(passed)
Ani: pro con
Motoki: motion to bring back the original
Ani: no second there is no motion, pro for this?
Ian: I think what started out as a second argument, this is different from what we started as, which is good. 
Austin: con, okay, at this point this debate has become too focused on religion on whether honoring Aaster is a good enough excuse, if you take that out of the factor, you will see some other issues with giving the committee the authority to move the election, 1 looking at the timeline of how this effects the rest of the elections, week three they would transitions. so even at the fastest you could get this out, would be week 9 or ten, losing the rest of spring quarter, exec believes this is a detriment. Midterms have been brought up. we are at an academic institution, last year we were elected a week before I had 3 midterms. there are certain dates that have president, that other groups work around. 
Francis: were this to pass we cant change the date of this election, 
Ani: this would have to happen within the last week of winter quarter, 
Francis: could be proposed earlier if the speaker put it on the agenda. 
There is no objection to PQ
roll call vote
(14 yes, 9 no)
does not pass)
Adjourned
