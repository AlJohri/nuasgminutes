Alex: We aren’t arguing about the bill tonight right?
Katie: Yes, tonight it is informational.
Carolyn: I am President of the Public Health Club. We are moving to
make NU a tobacco-free campus. It is a huge killer in America and
Illinois. Second hand and even third hand smoke is very dangerous.
There are 766 campus also making this move. It will benefit the
university financially and health-wise. It will cut down on littering,
health-care costs. So if you guys have any questions…?
Alex: How much weight would you say in cigarette liter is there?
Carolyn: I don’t know
Petros: Have you talked to the administration?
Carolyn: Yes, the administration passed a smoke-free bill. They
didn’t understand the difference between smoke-free and tobaccofree.
Mark: Can you explain the difference between smoke free and
tobacco free?
Carolyn: Yes there is a difference. This bill also includes ecigarettes. We are collecting all of this together.
Taylor: How will the university enforce this?
Carolyn: Signage and peer encouragement.
Taylor: What will consequences be?
Carolyn: Police can be involved, like they could maybe search
students if they found their activity to potentially be suspicious.
Petros: Will this just push smoking off campus?
Carolyn: That is a worry. But 70% of smokers do want to stop. And
there are statistics that prove that
Alex: Can you smoke while driving by?
Carolyn: Technically, I guess no.
Isaac: What is the current rule?
Carolyn: No smoking within 25 feet of ventilation and doorways and
in university buildings.
Harrison: If the language of the bill we pass and the Faculty Senate
differ, what will happen?
Carolyn: the Faculty Senate want to uphold the tobacco-free bill.
Senator: Why e-cigarettes?

Carolyn: There is empirical data that I have on hand, but I feel that
it should be included.
Melanie: Would there be tobacco-free products on campus?
Carolyn: NO
Alex: What would the implementation timeline be?
Carolyn: A couple of months.
Senator: So could students have cigarettes in their rooms?
Carolyn: Technically no, but that would be hard to track.
Mark: Who will be implementing this?
Carolyn: I don’t know yet, but we wanted to show support for this
from ASG first.
Mark: Should this be legislation so we can have action to help this?
Carolyn: I was told not to.
Sean: Can we explain the difference between Resolution and
Legislation?
Katie: A resolution calls for support and legislation calls for action to
be taken by ASG.
Arian: Does this to the possession of tobacco products, like if
someone had a pack of cigarettes in their pocket?
Carolyn: The whole campus would be tobacco free.
Arian: So would off campus students have to stash cigarettes
before coming on campus?
Carolyn: I don’t think that would be an issue.
Dillon: Why don’t you just make it for no use of tobacco on
campus?
Carolyn: It is a social norm change.
Petros: Do you have any statistics on use of tobacco on campus and
statistics of complaints of use.
Carolyn: I don’t think we have stats for complaints, but we do have
statistics for students who smoke.
Taylor: You said police officer like this because it gives them
greater right to search students?
Carolyn: It’s not to search students.
Taylor: So what are we doing for enforcement?
Carolyn: We won’t know that until further down the line.
Mark: Motion to extend questioning by 3 minutes.

Katie: Great let’s explain what this is. We have 10 minutes for
question period. And you can ask to extend the period by
motioning. The we will vote on it. For, against, or abstain. All in
favor? Opposed? Abstaining?
[passes by visual vote]
David: Are you familiar is with what COFHE is?
Carolyn: No
David: it is a collection of private schools that our administration
compares us to and looks to a lot for moves on issues like this.
What schools have adopted this sort of tobacco-free campus policy?
Carolyn: Some Harvard institutions, Stanford, and some others.
And a full list is online.
Mark: I have a question for Abby. Has this gone through Rules?
Abby: Yes. That is why it is here tonight.
Mark: Okay, we will talk.
Melanie: Have you talked to smokers about this?
Carolyn: Yes, and a lot of smokers are against this. But a lot of
smokers in the end are usually in support of moves like this
eventually.
Katie: Any more questions? Okay thanks Carolyn. This will be old
business next week and then we will vote on this.
New Business: Associate Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion
Selection Process Presentation
• Alex: Okay we are going to do a little presentation.
• Katie: Any questions about legislation really fast?
• Dylan: How many votes to make it pass?
• Katie: Majority.
• Alex: So AVP of D&I has been vacant since spring of 2013. Since
then we have really evaluated with our advisors, CoC, and others
on campus to really talk about what this position is. We went back
to the drawing board and kind of redefined the role better. You can
read this and there is a link in the agenda. What we want to
emphasize is that this position is simply a voice to Ani and I, and
we will be the ones speaking on these issues for ASG. They will
assist with me and Ani on projects relating to D&I. They will be
sitting on various committees that are pertinent to their role. There

is an Eva Jefferson day, an old ASG President in MLK Jr’s day, and
they will be working on that. It will function very similarly to Anna
and Sophia’s role where they sit on university committees that
relate to their role. Okay so qualifications. Most importantly,
experience in the related area. We want to see track record and
dedication to D&I on campus. Ability to work across various
communities. This position is open to anyone on campus, as long as
they meet the qualifications. If this is a passion of yours, please feel
free to apply.
Mark: Can you speak to the status of the group and how it will
factor into the process?
Alex: Sophia?
Sophia: We reached out to them over the summer and asked about
their projects. Some have left the committee, but are still working
on D&I issues. All have been reached out to though in the summer
and fall.
Mark: So there is a committee? Or would they have a recruitment
process?
Alex: Yes there will be a recruitment process after the selection of
the AVP. So this is brought to you, because when there is a
vacancy, the process that we are going to take to fill it must be
approved by Senate. There is a new selection committee, chaired
by Ani and David. I will sit on there, Anna, Sophia, Coalition of
Color co-chairs as non-voting members to share their thoughts.
Katie will also be on there. This mirrors what we did in spring.
Normally the outgoing member sits on there, but she has
graduated. Apps will be released tomorrow if passed. And then we
will use grassroots method to spread the word. Apps due next
Wednesday and approval will happen in 2 Wednesdays. Any
questions? I want this as clear as possible.
Elena: Are you going to be sending this out?
Katie: Yes it is linked in the agenda/
Alex: Also a lot of this will appear on the application.
Dylan: Is there written record of this?

Abby: Yes I am taking minutes. As Parliamentarian that is one of
my duties, and you can view the minutes that will be linked in next
week’s minutes.
• Senator: Do we get email updates about this?
• Katie: Yes I was going to announce this later, but if you are not on
the list serve let me know. Any questions about this process though
right now? Okay, great so we will vote on this selection process. So,
we will now move to a vote.
[passes by visual vote]
Okay, so now we are doing something a little new. We are swearing
in all new senators. This is new. We have a book but there are a lot
of you, so you can just stand up. I will now administer the oath.

happening on campus or a comment that they would like to make
to Senate.

Katie: Skipping second round if Rules elections temporarily to
consider this bill
Carolyn: only affect usage, not possession. No ability to search
students. In addition, tobacco policies have been changing all our
lives. Slippery slope, you can’t go back once you start. Initial
opposition, but it tapers off as time goes by and everyone gets used
to it. Tobacco free instead of smoke free, in order to include
potentially unsafe products and maintain uniformity in the
community. Also assures for promotion of overall health for the
students at large. Harder to pass tobacco free after smoking free
because of loss of momentum. Inclusion of COFHE schools in the
proposed amendments. Faculty Senate has already passed a similar
resolution.
Katie: 10 minutes for questions
Harrison: Isn’t tobacco free campus a misleading term?
Carolyn: Generally used terminology for these resolutions.
Jacob: Work with grad students?
Carolyn: Working with med school student.
Jacob: Enforcement on Chicago and Evanston campus?
Carolyn: Ideally yes.
Ronak: Talk to staff?
C: yeah
Adam: Have you talked to campus security?
C: Not yet, we wanted this support first.
Mark: People don’t abide by 25 feet rule, so how will this help?
C: Signage and also getting rid of ash trays.
Evan: What about staff and workers that smoke? Would they have
to go off campus?
C: Yes that it is what they would have to do. 69% of people do
want to quit smoking
Senator: Do you have any stats on here?
C: 3.4% and 12.9% from Searle
Taylor: Do you have any background information that this currently
is working?
Carolyn: The numbers have gone down since 2010.

Adam: Have you talked to any other groups or organizations that
have adopted polices such as this?
Carolyn: Yes….
Senator: How will this be enforced?
Carolyn: signage and will be introduced through spread of word.
Timo: What difficulties have people had with implementing this?
Carolyn: It just take times and changing the social norm.
Isaac: Don’t you think it is harsh to compare an outdoor smoke-free
policy to an indoor policy.

are transitioning to these policies slowly.
Elena: Have you talked with administration and staff that will have
to enforce this?
Carolyn: Only some

protect the public health of those around us.

estimate 25 feet.
Senator: Do you have any stats on progress for schools that have
implanted this?
C: A lot are still in the implementation phase.
Taylor: Sheridan sidewalk belongs to Evanston, could students

Dana: Motion to amend. Motion to put in all amendments in red.
“reads amendments”
Senator: 2nd
Katie: Okay we will now move to a vote.
[pass]
Katie: Great those pass. And now we will move into debate.
Petros: I don’t think that this is the solution to a current 25 foot
legislation law, and we shouldn’t put forth more legislation to pass
this. It is up to Evanston to demand for their policies to should
enforce there own issues.
Katie: Pro speech
Sean: I am not 100% sure about the this. I am more in offense of
what Petros said. This is a resolution, not a legislation mandating
action. This isn’t a band aid resolution, but it is for when they go
forth to those to who will find a solution to show that they have
ASG support.
Alex: Hi I’m Alex and I am here to speak against this legislation. As
students, we are adults and should have a right to smoke. And it
would be problematic to staff to go off campus. I think this
resolution breeds mistrust amongst students, and I think going up
to someone and a making a comment about someone else’s health
would breed more problems.
Carolyn: It is about protecting the right of non-smokers, not against
current smokers. We are choosing the right for a clean air and
healthy environment.
Mark: If that is the case, why are you supporting a full tobacco
ban?
Carolyn: It is move to support a healthier life overall, and we don’t
know yet the effects of e-cigarettes.
Isaac: I think that my issue with the resolution is that we are
inflating issues of smoking with all tobacco products. I like clean air,
but it is someone’s right to be able to chew or smoke e-cigarettes. I
think it’s an insane way to look at the world to ban things that are
bad for them. What’s next, cookies? I think that the school needs
less rules not more rules. The closest place on campus for kids to
smoke is Sheridan road. So, logistically everyone would go to

•

•
•
•
•
•
•

•

•

•

Sheridan road, the most populated area of campus. Is that where
we want all of the smokers of Northwestern to go? Think about it.
Alex: I can understand the issue with e-cigarettes. I do think that
we should keep chewing tobacco. People tend to turn to tobacco if
they can’t smoke to get nicotine. And chewing tobacco is gross if
you have ever seen it and you don’t want to do that either.
Sean: Would you be willing to amend this to be a smoke-free
campus?
Carolyn: I would like to keep e-cigarettes, but if it won’t pass than
this then yes.
David: Motion to amend to take out and e-cigarettes.
Carolyn: Evanston may pass legislation about e-cigarettes.
David: I don’t think that is relevant.
Kevin: It is still under consideration and it is still skeptical.
Katie: All in favor of David's amendments? Opposed? Abstain?
[Passes]
Katie: We are out of time for debate. So we will now move to a
vote.
Senator: Division
[10, 19, 8]
Katie: The resolution fails.
New Business: SL1314-01 The Never Ending Story of the 10K
Initiative
Author Speech/Alex: This is legislation that clarifies the initiative. In
the fall a survey gets released to the student body for ideas on how
to spend $10,000. We go through those ideas and then recommend
approximately 5. Senate then approves or denies those ideas and
they are sent out. Whichever wins the popular vote is then enacted.
A lot of things were passed, but never became part of the ASG
Code. Basically, what happened before was that there were no term
limits, which confused things. If that makes sense at all. You now
must be re-elected every year as an ASG rep. I also added 5-7
submission because that is more clear. And, yeah.
Mark: Why is reasonable similarity to other selection processes
relevant criteria?

Alex: We could combine ideas that are similar. Like benches and
tables.
Mark: Does that not read against ideas that are out of the box?
Alex: No, but if you think so we can amend.
Senator: We fund all of this now?
Alex: Yes
Senator: Can those on the committees submit an idea?
Alex: I don’t know, but it would have to work more as a trust
system
Mark: I don't think that is consequential. It is about finding the best
idea of all students.
Dana: My question is about change from approximately 5 to 5-7.
What if there is only 4? Do we just present a bad idea?
Alex: Ani can speak to this.
Ani: It’s more as a guideline to the committee to not cut so harshly.
Alex: Last year we got 300 submissions, I hope we can find 5.
Senator: How many people vote in the final selection?
Alex: I don't know. I don’t have those numbers first-hand.
Senator: We will put a threshold on how many students are voting
to see if it is worth putting forth $10K?
Alex: I think we do have a good enough turn out of voting to keep
this going. It is a yearly thing. Outreach is definitely critical though.
Dana: Point of Information: last year it was nearly 2000 votes.
Taylor: Last year, it said the money that wasn’t spent last year
would be rolled over. What oversight would we have for budgeting
and making sure we are spending the money smartly.
Alex: We have to give a presentation at the end to Senate about
where the money went, and Senate acts as oversight.
David: Motion to move this to old business.
Katie: Okay, that means we will not wait to next week to go to
debate about the legislation, but we will debate tonight and then
vote on it.
Dana: I object.
Alex: I would normally let this be old business next week, but we
are doing elections next week. And I want to advertise opening for

the committee. And right now there are no term limits. I want to
advertise 3 and 3, instead of I think 2.
Isaac: Why can’t we move elections back a week?
Alex: We want to get started with PR immediately. We did a hard
campaign last year, and I want things to go well again. And we are
already almost 4 weeks in the quarter.
Mark: We are not voting on new ideas, just to codify them right?
Dana: I rescind my objection.
Katie: We will not move to a vote.
David: I motion to PQ.
Mark: Can I amend?
David: I withdraw.
Mark: Can we amend or strike 3a?
Taylor: Motion to amend to say similarity of ideas…
Sean: Yes like similar ideas can be bunched together.
Katie: How would you want to say this?
Mark: Does this need to be in the code?
Abby: Common law
Alex: I just don’t know if we would be able to combine ideas.
Dana: Didn't senate do that last year?
Katie: Yes senate did that last year.
Mark: We all know what we are trying to say, but I don't think it
belongs in that section.
Sean: I think we can combine ideas to free up a slot, but I withdraw
for better wording.
Alex: I motion to amend, add “The committee reserves the right to
combine similar ideas.”
Sean: I like this. Yep. This is what I was wanting to do.
Katie: This would be section 4 and then we would change numbers.
Isaac: Motion to amend to add Senate.
Katie: Not necessary.

Abstaining?

Good of the Order & Announcements
• Abby: Congrats to Isaac, the newest member of Senate.
• Anna: We got 22 new members, which is great and they will fit into
good roles. Jen met with Sodexo about to-go options. Please give
her some feedback
o Jen: So basically, Rachel is marketing head of Sodexo, and
we are looking to roll-out the wildcat to-go plan. We will test
a pilot program in the west side of foster-walker.
o Katie: Any feedback?
o Mark: What happened to great room?
o Anna: Closed.
o Mackenzie: Can we use regular meal swipes for it?
o Rachel: That was the original idea, but it doesn’t work for
unlimited meal plans.
o Katie: Questions?
• Abby: Okay Senate Reform update. I met with Burgie who
determined school wide coverage for the Weekly isn’t feasible. Now
I am working on reaching out to each school. Weinberg is tricky.
School-wide emails aren’t really sent out normally and we cannot
go by department because those who are still undeclared would
never hear from their Senator. I will give you an update when I
hear from the schools.
• Harrison: What did Burgie say?
• Abby: Logistically it wasn’t feasible to send out school wide updates
and announcements about ASG. It is too cumbersome.
• Mark: Tuesday, Seed is bring Adrian Green from Entourage to talk
about green issues.
• Jaime: Saturday morning, 8-10, breakfast on the block, some
sororities are coming to together, $3.
• David: This Sunday, dancer registration for DM starts. If you don’t
know what that is, well you’re not living. Also talk and spread
interest. Also, let me know if there is any interest in creating an
ASG team.
• Katie: My sorority is hosting a slumber-party registered party. We
are also holding a Ztate Fair.

Special Order: Associate VP for Diversity and Inclusion Confirmation -Thaddeus Tukes

•

•

•
•

•
•

•

•

Ani: Just to give you guys a refresher on the committee itself, a few
of us came in and presented this revamped position. This position
was created last year and works under the Director of Student Life.
We updated the position description to include how Northwestern
approaches Diversity and Inclusion. The position is not the sole
person in ASG responsible to all things Diversity and Inclusion
related. They are the expert and the person of contact and help us
navigate issues related to Diversity and Inclusion. The position is
supposed to serve all students on campus, because at this
university we hold Diversity and Inclusion highly. Any questions?
Thaddeus really blew us away in the interview and touched on not
only the obvious issues, but also more subtle ideas.
Thaddeus: My name is Thaddeus Tukes, I’m a sophomore here,
doubling in Jazz Studies and Journalism. I applied for this position
because I have not only observed events last year and this year,
but also I’ve also spoken to many leaders and have noticed holes in
communication. I don’t see minority groups just as race, gender,
sexuality, etc. but any group that is underrepresented.
Taylor: One advantage members on exec have had is the time
they’ve had already. How will you start out?
Thaddeus: A lot of what I’ll be doing are things I’ve already started
doing on a micro-scale. Being in this position allows me to do it at a
larger scale. I don’t have the same experience they’ve had, but I do
have experience and knowledge that I can use and apply to that
larger scale.
Alex: What do you say is the most similar position to this one that
you’ve held in the past?
Thaddeus: I’m also the editor of Pulse Magazine and one of my
roles is expanding the magazine. How can we reach more
communities and expand what we’re doing. I’ve been in that
position for a year and it’s my most applicable official experience.
Mark: You are obviously very accomplished on campus and I
imagine you double majors are also time consuming. How will you
manage your time?
Thaddeus: It’s just a matter of changing spaces. A lot of what I’ll be
doing are things I already do every day. Now, instead of it being in

•
•

•
•

•
•

•
•
•
•

•
•

my own personal space, it’ll be in the public space. It will be an
additional time commitment, but definitely manageable.
Alex: When did you hear about this position and when did you
make your decision to run?
Thaddeus: I heard about it last year and didn’t realize that it was
open this year until a day before the deadline. Luckily there was an
extension.
Isaac: How are you at relating to people who are not a member of
your specific community?
Thaddeus: Even within my own community there are people that
are very different. The way I approach everything is very open. I
know I’m in a unique position. I’m the only jazz studies and
journalism on campus and I would like people to approach me as a
unique and open person, so I do that for them.
April: How do you plan to use ASG to bring together different
communities?
Thaddeus: The first step is to approach the student and faculty
leadership in various realms. If you get all of the leadership on
board and on the same page, it’ll be easier to connect the groups. I
will be going person to person and within groups of friends, but the
key thing is to get the leadership in on the same agenda. Then we
can expand and simultaneously become inclusive.
Mark: Have you had the opportunity to interact with the committee
as it exists now?
Thaddeus: No I haven’t. That’s probably because I’m not in the
position.
Mark: How do you plan to lead a committee?
Thaddeus: The best example I like to lead is being the leader of a
band. I know about egos and personalities and opinions. As a
leader, you have to listen to what everyone has to say and
understanding what we can do and what we can. Not everyone will
agree, but I’m going to try my absolute best to compromise.
April: How do you plan to get other students involved in ASG,
especially communities that are underrepresented.
Thaddeus: Leadership. I have to go to the people with sway and
have them explain how important it is. We need to impress on

•
•

•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

everyone how important it is to be a part of ASG and be able to
influence change. Leadership is the first priority, but after that I
want to work with that leadership to help communities understand
the importance.
Gio: Can you list off some of the relevant people?
Thaddeus: I can say I’ve spoken with – administration is a difficult
one. I have not yet been in a position to address them forthright.
I’ve spoken with the leaders of Alianza and FMO. That’s how I found
that there was a lack of communication between those two groups.
Obviously there are more groups than that. I do have to reach out
more to leaders, but that will definitely happen.
Katie: Okay that is the end of question period.
Mark: Motion to extend by three minutes.
Senator: Second.
Taylor: There are obviously some students who don’t think diversity
is important, what do you say to them?
Thaddeus: It really is hard to convince people who don’t see the
need. First, I would express to them the amount of resources they
would have access to in an inclusive environment. Friendships,
relationships, jobs, careers, everything. If you want to become the
best you, that requires putting yourself in positions that you might
not be comfortable with.
Alex: Who’s your favorite jazz musician?
Thaddeus: That’s a hard question, bro.
Angela: One of the issues in diversity debates has been the
emotionality that arises. How would you approach that obstacle?
Thaddeus: I would let them know that being emotional is okay.
Different experiences will cause emotional responses. What I will do
is create safe spaces. Yes this will be touchy, emotional, and you
might be offended, but we have to go there. I won’t say it’ll be
emotionless, but I want to help people work through that.
Katie: That’s the end of question period.
Mark: Motion to extend by 3 minutes.
Senator: Second.
Mark: The university is using the euphemism “uncomfortable
learning.” What do you think about it?

Thaddeus: I think the concept is good, but you’re predisposing
people to feel uncomfortable. I do like the idea of people being
uncomfortable, but it could be reworded.
Harrison: What do you see being your major accomplishments a
year from now?
Thaddeus: Communication, because once you establish that, that’s
how you get expansion and change. I’m also interested in mental
health and we’ve seen the consequences of ignoring our well being.
I want to work with Student Life and the rest of exec to help us feel
like we’re in a safer and more comfortable environment. We’re
young, we should not be this stressed. I don’t want to give a
general answer, but more inclusivity. It sounds ambiguous, but in
general we should have a safer and more comfortable environment
between communities.
Katie: That’s the end of question period.
[Confirmed unanimously.]
[OATH ADMINISTERED]
Order: 10K Committee Elections
Katie: We will now move to the non-Senator positions for the 10K
committee.
Alex: The 10K Committee is in charge of conducting the 10K
Initiative. Fall is a low commitment about getting the word out and
getting students to submit the ideas. Then in Winter we narrow
down the ideas that then get submitted to Senate. Then 4 weeks to
the end of Winter, the final ideas get sent out to students to vote
on. Then Spring is about getting it accomplished.
Katie: We have 3 non-ASG positions.
Senator: Frances
Alex: 2nd
Harrison: Dane Steer
Alex: 2nd
Dane: What is going on? No thanks.
Alex: if any positions, aren't filled, I can just fill them.
Isaac: How? Your friends?
Alex: It is up to my discretion, but it will be a legitimate process.

Frances: My name is Frances Woo and I am a junior. I want to be
on 10K because I am very involved on campus. I founded a group
on campus promoting public and mental health. I am involved in
SHAPE and my Greek community. These experiences have given
me the opportunities to work with ASG already, working on the
alcohol working group and others. I really want to help the
Northwestern student body. I have great time management skills,
but I have already made connections to many people on campus.
Alex: What was your favorite idea last year?
Frances: The mental health one.
[Confirmed unanimously]
Katie: We will now move to fill 3 ASG spots. Nominations?
Harrison: Korri and Evan
Korri: I accept
Evan: I accept
Angela: Danielle Lay
Danielle: I accept
Isaac: Mark Silberg
Mark: Kind, but no.
Nevil: I nominate myself.
Korri: I am the Elder Senator and I am interested in being on the
10K committee because this year as a freshman I have been blown
away by how passionate the student body is. And I want to be an
active part to help facilitate having student ideas come alive.
Evan: I am the Allison Senator. I was on the 10K committee last
year, and I love working to make student ideas real. It is like a live
Campus Voice.
Angela: I am on SGC. I want to be on 10K because I think ASG is
an invaluable resource to Northwestern and people underestimate
the power of student voice with ASG. I think that is really
important. On campus, I have been involved in SGC since
Freshman year, I am VP of Finance for one of the newest groups for
NSH, and I am in an a cappella group.
Nevil: I am on Services. I was on D&I and PLI and that allowed me
to get exposed to many aspects of Northwestern. I am a CA. The

•

10K really fascinates me, and the idea of getting ideas and seeing it
through to completion I would really like to do.
Petros: What would be your winning 10K idea?
Evan: I am going to go with one that I saw last year. Sorry to be
cheating. I would go with an outdoor movie theater. I think it would
be a great way to bond the Northwestern community.
Danielle: More Saferides. More cars and resources.
Nevil: I would suggest updating the bus signs to track shuttles and
buses.
Korri: I would want to update Patten gym. I would want it to be a
more full-scale gym. I think it would help with late night workouts
and on cold days when walking isn’t very good.
Isaac: I move to end question period.
Senator: 2nd
Alex: Oh and Maddy Low wanted to run. Here are some notes she
sent me to read:
o 1. I'm Maddy Low, senior theatre major, environmental policy
minor, Chinese minor. I'm the senator for StuCo.
o 2. I'm interested in the committee because I think a lot of NU
students feel like there's a lot of bureaucracy in the way of
their voices being heard about suggestions they have to make
NU a better place, things that don't fit into the established
channels, and the 10K is a great avenue for them.
o 3. I'm currently in a show that rehearses 4-5 nights a week
(hence why I'm not at senate this week) but weekends are
free and the show ends mid-November.
o 4. I've produced student theatre before so I have first-hand
experience with how far an amount like $10,000 can go on
campus, and the proudest I've felt as a producer was when I
was able to not only say "yes" to a team member's idea, but
be able to support it with money we raised. I've been
involved with all kinds of activities in my four years from
Jones Res College exec to marching band to theatre to
Engineers for a Sustainable World so I've got my feet in lots
of areas on campus and think I would be a good candidate to

raise awareness and have conversations about the 10K
initiative across the spectrum.
[Winners: Evan, Nevil, Maddy]
• David: Motion to move SL1314 up.
• Senator: Objection.
• Katie: We move to debate.
• David: Motion to suspend the rules and vote.
• Senator: Objection
• Katie: We are going to go to a vote.
• Katie: Now we are going to go for a vote on whether to move the
agenda item up. That’s two thirds, so we are going to see the new
business SL1314 now. We are in line for an authorship speech.
New Business: SL1314-02: Increasing Dance Marathon Accessibility
• DM Exec: First off thanks for changing the agenda. As a bit of
background information, we strongly feel that DM is one of NU’s
strongest organizations. No matter who you are you can participate,
but the $50 registration fee does stop people. We are asking for
some money from the Senate Pool. The students would have to
apply for a scholarship through CSI to help them register to dance.
This is a registration fee and should not be confused with the
money raised for DM. Students who get external scholarship will be
considered in the same way as people with Northwestern Financial
Aid. One of our goals is to help people sign up who aren’t able to
financially. Any of the $4000 that isn’t used will be given back to
the pool. And if it is used, that shows we do have need. And
according to ISBE the reason most students are not able to
participate financially is due to the registration fee.
• Senator: What if they can’t raise the $400?
• Janet: That is a difficult question, but we would refund the $50.
• Josh: We wouldn’t give back donations, but we would refund the
$50.
• Sean: How much do we have in the Project Pool?
• Katie: $15,000
• Taylor: Why don’t you just waive the fees?
• Josh: We need that money for the actually production of DM.

Anna: And any money that is raised goes straight to the
beneficiary.
Taylor: Why don’t you get the productions money donated?
Janet: The money from registration fees does not cover all of the
production costs and we do raise money for it as well.
Nikki: Would this go to towards this year?
Anna: Yes, on the registration right now there is a box you can
check to talk to a CSI member.
Isaac: Is this something you are going to ask for every year.
Janet: We are looking for more sustainable resources.
David: We have talking to PTI right now. We are a sustainable
group, but we are in the position that we need those fees to make
DM possible.
Sean: Can you talk about your decision to be B-Status?
David: This is due to revenue fees. If we received a large amount of
money, it would be worth it. But since we would have to give back
80% of ticket sales (registration fees) to the fund, it does not make
sense for us right now to become and A-Status group.
Isaac: So you will never become A-Status?
David: That is not necessarily true. We are looking at adjusting the
rules to make it make sense for us.
Isaac: You guys get a lot of corportate sponsors. You would just
raise $1M instead of $1.4. So is that what you are asking from
Senate?
Janet: No that is not how our corporate sponsorships work.
Anna: It would be considered embezzlement if we didn’t have what
they donate for exactly go towards exactly towards that.
Sophia: Would you look at Student Affairs to get money, if it wasn’t
awarded tonight? Or would your return the money not used to the
Pool? So, if only 1K is given or even used?
Josh: Yes. We are making a conservative estimate.
David: The money could go back this quarter.
Natalie: Would it be helpful if I explained the SASF? This is a fund
for $5000 per quarter, and it is a fund that is used for any student
for any student group that demonstrates for need for financial aid.
The way that is vetted is that they fill out an application and sign

something that lets me go to Financial Aid to get a ranking. It is not
a perfect system, such as if you receive money from another source
for school. We are encouraging students to apply for this first, and
then this money that you are giving would help supplement that.
Katie: We are out of time.
David: I motion to move this to old business due to time
sensitivity?
Senator: Objection
David: We need the money this year and it would be negligible for
next year. Registration ends Friday.
Josh: Not totally negligible. But if the idea is about inclusion, we
need to make sure we have the money this week.
Senator: Would this make it old business and move to the end of
agenda?
Katie: Yes
Petros: You all probably set this time for registration a long time
ago, and you should have come last week.
Ani: As an old Speaker, I understand the importance of
parliamentary procedure. But, this idea has developed over the past
couple of days, and we have been trying to connect the dots. But
we are talking about inclusion here. We want to make sure DM is
representative of the whole student body.
Isaac: I don’t understand why you can’t move your deadline one
week to accommodate the procedure of Senate, because you are
asking for 1/3 of our money for the year.
Evan: I do understand what you are saying, but not making this old
business that makes this money useless.
Alex: I absolutely understand the objections, I normally would
agree, but this money will not be gone immediately. The money will
only be gone if students really need it. And isn’t that what the pool
is for?
Taylor: I think that one thing is being said is that this would be
good for our constituents. But, if I don’t talk to my constituents,
then I don’t know. Also, if registration for DM has increased each
year, then I am not sure why this would be necessary. And I think

extending registration due to finance concerns, that would be
creating more inclusivity.
• Sean: They came in here with a lot of background information and

• David: If you were to talk to your constituents, they would say 2
things, “yes I do this money, or not I don’t.” So the money will be
spent or it won’t. And the bill is built for just that. As a long-time
member of ASG, I understand, but I don’t want this to affect
someone’s ability to participate in DM.
• Will: I think we need to be able to go back to our constituents.
• Mark: Authors, can you explain the claim that students don’t
participate because of the registration fee?
• David: ISBE analytics conducted it because they are much better at
it. I am not sure how they question is worded, and but I know that
need for a fund like this is needed. This would pay for 80 students,
and if 300 apply then we will take a look at they applications.

Working on the SAFC, I have noticed continuity working with the
student group is extremely important. Also, there is a huge learning
curve, and I think I am in a great position to help my groups
continue to be doing well.
Jason: I am a five quarter member of SAFC. I agree experience is
really great. I have help coordinate inter-group programming. And I
think that the relationships I have are strong and should continue.

my student groups and I want to apply that to other student
groups.
Sean: I’m Sean, junior, IFC Senator. I have been an AE for a year
now, so I do know the time commitment. I have worked with 3 very
unique groups, smaller and larger. I have helped the smaller groups
rise up to success, and the larger groups continue to succeed. As an
AE, I have learned a lot and gained a lot of experience that I think
is very necessary for this position.
Tori: I was a senator until the end of last year. I am the longest
standing member of the SAFC and have worked with all sorts of
student groups. And it has been the most rewarding experience. We
currently have a young board, and I would love to see it continue to
grow.
Adam: This is my second time to run for SAFC, and I am very
passionate about student groups. This year, I asked Siddiq how I
can pitch in. I have now talked to 15 student groups, asking how
can we help them as ASG. Because what is obvious to an AE, may
not be apparent to student group leaders. I have been a leader of
student group, and I think that experience would really aid me even
though I haven’t served on SAFC yet. I think I would be an
innovative and helpful AE.
Will: I am a junior and a College Republicans Senator. I have
worked at 2 banks, so I think I can combine my experience there
and with student groups and ASG.
Ronak: I am an off-campus senator. I want to give Northwestern a
bigger focus of the whole school. I am apart of model UN, and we
raise our $50,000 budget internally, as well as working on our
current deficit. I have lot of experience with student group
budgeting, and I want to help work with groups to get recognized,
because we have a lot of student groups that should be heard, and

Siddiq: We do work a lot of hours but it is a selfless job. You have 2
midterms on Wednesday and it is Tuesday, and you have to attend
an SAFC meeting or else Blowout wont’ happen. When have you
Tori: I have a job offer, so school doesn’t matter anymore. I would
definitely prioritize the group over the school work and I have done
it before and I will do it again. It’s about programming using a lot of
money compared to one grade.
Adam: I interviewed this week with a student group leader when I
had to study for a midterm. I would make sure to make us. Also,
we could create an anonymous facebook persona, so all can take
advantage of asking questions.
Will: It is all about prior planning, so hopefully it won’t happen. But
if that were to happen, you need to make this commitment a
priority. I am apart of ISBE, and working with micro financing I had
a lot of reports to get in and prioritized ISBE.
Ronak: I would make sure I didn’t get into that issue. And my
grades only affect me, so I would have. I have 2 midterms
tomorrow, so I am experiencing that tonight.
Eliza: A&O Blowout, I had a lot of work, so did I have to pull a lot of
late nights. Yes, but it was worth it.
Sean: I think knowing what you are getting into before you do it
really is important. Being flexible with your schedule means good
communication. So working with. Also, I am a film major, so that is
not that burdening…were going to cut it off there.
Isaac: I motion to close question period
Alex: I object.
Isaac: I rescind
Amrit: Time commitments?
Adam: I am apart of the c. I will make sure that the student groups
that I work with will always be able to reach me. I have worked
with an AE and know the importance
NARS, NUCR, and Senator
AKPsi, and Model UN, but those aren’t too time consuming until
Spring for Model UN.

Old Business: SL1314-02: Increasing Dance Marathon Accessibility
• DM Exec: I think at this point everyone understands the logistics.
From our understanding inclusion is the end goal for everyone and I
know that’s a priority for ASG. The project pool is really cool and
using all the money is ideal, because it shows that there is a need.
The competency about us does not have to be worried about,
because we are going through the Northwestern department that
always does this. We’ve been asked why we aren’t trying to get this
money from other places and it is because we know that ASG’s
mission matches this initiative. This is a great way not to ask
students to single themselves out, but to give them an opportunity
to ask anonymously. If we get this from ASG then we can use it to
show the administration later on.
• Isaac: Are you putting any of your own money to this? For instance,
you could have some kind of fundraiser for production expenses?
• Josh: For us it is really difficult to distinguish the fundraising for the
organization and the beneficiary. For legal purposes, we want to
keep fundraising for the beneficiary. We are not giving Senate Pool
money to Team Joseph and we are not going to ask people to

fundraise for a tent and not for the beneficiary. Our costs go mostly
to put on DM as a production. We haven’t put forth money to do
this, because we don’t have the capacity to do so.
David: We were cornered to raised our registration fees. We are
have a lot of expenses and pressures that made us raise our
registration fees 11%.
Taylor: You said this was a short-term solution but you are looking
towards longs term. What are some of those?
Janet: We are hoping that this will be a catalyst for other
Northwestern bodies to help out in the future.
Josh: This is a conversation that would need to happen in the
spring.
David: We have already talked to PTI. If you think that we think
this is our fund, then next year you can turn it down. This pool is
for causes just like this.
Isaac: Do you see these extenuating circumstances being an issue
in the future.
Janet: NAA will be helping a lot more in the future.
Arian: You said that you may go around the conventional revenue
sharing. Are those conversations already going on?
David: That is something we are looking to explore in the future.
But I may have misspoke, but we are looking at our options for
more sustainable sources of funding for issues like this in the
future.
Ronak: Was the 11% inflationary, or reasons why you aren’t getting
as much sponsorships?
Janet: It is mostly due to relationships over the years with sponsors
and donors.
Josh: Each year we work to make the event safer and that is costly.
David: the extra costs are mostly due to a new financial system
that we had to use that was unexpected. But Northwestern is
working to help create a better financial system.
Taylor: Why wouldn’t you just lower the cost for student for those
who can’t pay?
Janet: We need a registration at X level because the revenue from
registration helps cover a portion of our production costs.

Taylor: Did you have an increase in dancers from last year?
Anna: Yes, but that doesn’t necessary mean it was from low income
students.
Isaac: I have an amendment. Be it enacted here assembled
“$2,000 be allocated from the ASG Senate Project Pool to provide
up to $2,000 of matching funds”. I think it is too early in the game
to allocate almost 1/3 of the Pool. I don’t remember even when we
took this money out of the budget, other than the fireworks at Dillo
Day. They said that they couldn’t raise funds that wouldn’t go to the
beneficiary. And I don’t think that is the case.
Senator: Did we spend the entire pool last year?
Katie: Not sure…
Alex: At the beginning of Spring, I think only $1000 was spent and
$5000 after that went to the project pool.
Isaac: I rescind.
Senator: Where did the fireworks money come from?
Sean: The fireworks are now sustainable.
Sarah: This is money goes towards production costs. This money
just offsets that for students.
Sean: They are B-status for a reason. On SAFC, we allocate $1.4M
pretty quickly. $20 for a B-status is a lot, and this would not be
much for a production like DM.
Siddiq: Did you work in a deficit last year since you didn’t get any
money last year from funding?
John: A lot of our funding comes from registration and a small fee
from our beneficiary.

to people
• David: Hey! So I have kind of a significant topic to preview you all
about. I have been thinking about Senate reform again. Thank you
for the input I have received so far. So for a bit of context, every
year I have been here, I am now a senior, that every year a Senate
Reform has come up. And while some legislation of some sort have
been passed to increase accountability for senators, but a greater
change has not been enacted. Currently, I see two problems
regarding Senate Reform. 1. Senators feel that it is just one
singular group coming up with the plan. 2. They present one solid
plan that you have no input. So, next week we are having an open
focus group forum during Senate next week. Also, a week from
Monday we will have a larger meeting for all students. We will also
solicit various members of campus to get their input. Then we will
devise 3-5 plans to then present in Senate to vet and then we will
present one final plan. Any questions?
• Alex: Do you think next week will be the best day because of
funding?
• David: yes we talked about it, and it should be fine. Also, fill out the

It is a really cool opportunity. Also the mentorship program will be

lot of considerable outreach this week. I have reach out to graduate
students, advisory boards. So if you have any personal contacts,
that would be really helpful for me to pass along. We are following
up on library chargers. Looking at practicum’s and JR’s. Please also
look at the Student Faculty Interaction Grant. It is a really neat
opportunity and you really should consider applying.
• Kevin: I will keep it brief. We just finished brainstorming and we
are in the beginning works of starting projects. We will be helping
out with the Evanston downtown bash. We are getting various
student groups to perform. Also, look out for the housing fair on
December 4th, and we will have another in the Winter. If you are
involved in a student group that wants to get further involved in the
community, please let me know. We are looking to be a resource
for students this week.

student group has any funding questions, please contact me.

Aires. I am really excited. If you can help out with interviews, that
would be great. Contact me.

Harrison: hey guys, so same thing as last year. No changes. This is
an event for NUSPAN, a graduate student group that got spread t
Chris: Have you thought about partnering with other student
groups on campus? I think this could be a great opportunity.
Harrison: That’s a great question. You can pool resources that way.
NUSPAN as it launches into the undergraduate student body, we
want to hold a lot of programming with many student groups. This
event specifically, we want this to be a repeat even for NUSPAN and
working with another group would hurt us next year with securing
funds.
Chris: So as a follow up, I think there are other groups on campus
that could help out.
Harrison: of course I understand that the Pool should be a last
resort, but we have gone to all of the resources we have explored.
Siddiq: Can you talk about other events that NUSPAN has put on
and the results?
Harrison: NUSPAN was a graduate student group. They had a
speaker last week. We had a small fall event, and for a new group
and a fairly last minute event, I was happy with the 20-25 people
that came. We want to add something to the environmental event.
Siddiq: How many undergraduate students came to the event, and
how many are on your exec board?
Harrison: 2 on the exec board and I am not sure how many came
to the spring event?
Siddiq: Do you think that this $50 is essential for the program to be
put on?
Harrison: for the best and full experience event, yes I do. I think
that the speaker is essential and then that food afterward would be
it essential.
Chris: At first I felt like $50 was not so much, but now I feel that
we as ASG should be encouraging now
Mark: Just so you know NUSPAN has a student that sits on the
sustainability committee, and it has been a group that has a PHD.
There is collaboration, but not financial.

Harrison: The speaker has been secured, so this is only for food

Alex: Is it okay for the funds to be allocated towards the speaker,
and not food?
Harrison: yes I guess that could happen. It is only an accounting
change.
Parag: Can you describe what you see as the future of NUSPAN.
Harrison: We want to discuss environmental events in the political
arena. We want this to be a policy discussing group, and I feel that
this event is the start of that.
Neel: The reason we don’t want normally give student groups food
is because we don’t find it sustainable. So have you looked into
venues that provide food?
Harrison: we did go to multiple different sources for food, well
groceries stores because we want cupcakes. I think that cupcakes
set a certain mood. We have looked at other sources, like the
sustainability fund. As far as the project pool goes, the pool should
be a last resort. We have tried to be organized, and we understand
that ASG should be our last line of defense and we are there. This is
a first time event. We want it to be sustainable, so we will not be
asking for further funds next year.
Katie: Question period is over.
Ani: Motion to amend to change the line item to cover the cost of
the speaker for the event.
Senator: 2nd
Katie: [Reads amendment] Any objections?
Sean: I object. Just seeing as what we have been discussing, we do
not fund retroactively. This event will occur no matter what, they
have the speaker. So, we should just fund the food, not what has
already been funded.
Mark: Just remember the pool is open for however Senators see fit.
Katie: We will now have a con for the amendment.
Adam: This is a more professional change. Food is not necessary,
and a speaker is more professional as well.
Alex: I don’t want a precedence that student groups can come to
Senate for food money, and a speaker is a much better choice.

Ani: To echo Mark’s comment, you can spend the pool money
however you see fit. I am just asking you all not to set a
precedence for food. I want to help student groups with this money,
but I want it to go to the speaker.
• Isaac: I have an issue with just misplacing funds so it looks like we
allocated money for a speaker. That is just disingenuous.
• Sean: We can just willy-nilly just spend the money on a case-bycase basis. Funding an event retroactively does not show
sustainability.

went down form $350 to $100. We had a lot of limitations and had
to be a little bit stingy. We get about $11,000 for 80 groups. Next

preliminary discussion on Senate.

o What assets do you identify in the current structure?
o What are the problems you identify with the current
structure?
o What solutions do you recommend?
If you have anything you want to say, this is the time to say it. We
will take this data and organize it in an open forum for all students
to get more feedback. Then we will come back with plans. Caucus
whips will be leading these discussions, but you will not be with
your caucus. We want you to disaffiliate yourselves from your
caucus, but don’t worry you are not voting on anything today.
• Katie: I will call out groups. Please stay in the area. Also, caucus
groups take notes please.
• Katie: Please send in your responses to David. And we have a new
Senator Megan. Please introduce yourself Megan.
• Megan: Hi my name is Megan, and I am replacing McKenzie as a
PHA Senator.
Old Business: B and T-Status Funding
• Katie: We will start with a cut round. Sheng will you please start
with an amendment pool of $500?

 Michael: I am president of ISA. ISA applied for funding
for $450 for the annual winter formal. I was surprised
when we received no funding for this. Last year we
were funded. The event attracts 200 students and two
security guards are needed $300 is needed for space
and safety, and $150 for lights and sounds
 GE: We didn’t give funding due to lack of funding. We
didn’t see this as a priority due to lowered attendance.
 Neel: Also, we are only
 Michael: We moved an event from fall to winter, and
that’s why we had 2 events in the same quarter.
 Alex: What do you mean by lack of attendance?
 GE: I didn’t feel like there was a large attendance last
year at the formal. It felt very empty. That is why we
are pushing for funding for the festival instead of
formal.
 Dana: How much is being asked for?
 Michael: For $450
 Isaac: How much were tickets last year, and how much
will they be this year if we do not fund this?
 Michael: Last year $19 and that covered venue costs
mostly. So it is hard to say. Probably about $20.
 Evan: Are formals normally funded?
 GE: It depends on what other programming the group
is doing. And if the formal is open to the entire campus.
The ISA formal is open and publicized to all, but it is

mostly international students that turn out. Which is
why the food and film festival was funded.
 Michael: We sold last year around 200 tickets.
 Siddiq: Where is the venue?
 Michael: The Hilton garden Inn or the Orrington?
 Petros: Have you looked for a cheaper venue?
 Michael: The Hilton was cutting costs.
 Ronak: why don’t you just raise tickets prices?
 Michael: We want to keep it as cheap as possible.
 Harrison: What happens if you don’t get this funding?
 Michael: We will raise ticket prices
 Parag: Do you think there will be decrease in
attendance if the ticket prices are raised?
 Michael: Yes
 Katie: We will now move to a con speech.
 Harrison: I motion to amend the funding request to
$300 for security guards.
 Senator: 2nd
 Katie: We will move to a vote.
[Passes]
 Harrison: I think this is in line with what SGC does. And
I would like to see this event go on.
 Katie: Con speech?
 GE: We normally don’t fund events off campus
 Isaac: Didn’t you fund it last year?
 Neel: We had a surplus, so it was lowest priority but we
did.
 Katie: We are in line for a con speech.
 Alex: I don’t think it is fair to fund only a couple groups
for 2 events. We need to do it for all groups, not just a
couple.
 Katie: We will move to a vote.

 David: Motion to add $200 to the line item tents.
 Katie: Okay come up and explain what the line item is.
 David: Two years ago we received $2000 and last year
we did not apply. To be honest, we were kind of
confused. We understand that ASG can’t fund DM. We
are kind of the status of an A-Status group but we can’t
forgo the money from revenue back to the SAF.
 GE: Why didn’t you apply for funding last year.
 David: It was a miscommunication on our part.
 GE: How did you manage if you didn’t have that
money?
 David: we kind of just made do. ASG gives very little to
DM so we have to find other ways. I am being very
transparent here. DM will go on if we don’t get this
money. We requested much more money than we were
allocated.
 Neel: So the $14,000 surplus. We had an $8000 deficit,
so we really only have a $6000 surplus. We want to try
to save as much for spring funding. Also DM is a highly
functioning group. We try to only fund groups that will
not be able to do funding for groups whose
programming would not otherwise go on.
 Isaac: This is going to seem irrelevant, but I will make
it seem relevant. When you asked for the $4000, you

said you couldn’t extend the deadline for registration
and then you did.
David: I pushed it to extend the deadline because I
thought we really should
Isaac: did that have any repercussions?
David: not any major ones?
Sarah: where is the money going to and why is it
important?
David: the tent is kind of arbitrary, but it is our biggest
costs. The tent is a fixed cost, and gets higher each
year as we get more participants. DM will go on no
matter what, but DM has to be more financially tight
than I had ever really expected.
Sarah: Sorry I think you misinterpreted the question. I
just want you to clarify for freshman.
David: Oh, sorry. The tent is put on the east lawn of
Norris and where hold the entire event each year.
GE: Why $200?
David: Because that’s how much we have left. I thought
we would have a bigger amendment pool. So, I am
asking for what is there.
GE: So where would the money go?
David: if it is allocated to the tent, it will go to the tent.
Harrison: why did you not ask for this in the first add
round.
David: It should go to a group first if a programming
event for them would not go on.
Katie: we are in line for a pro speech.
David: If you had an unlimited budget, think about
what sort of programming would you spend money on.
Students put more hours in to DM than any other event
on campus. We receive money 10 fold, 100 fold times
smaller than any other group on campus. Therefore, I
think

Alex: I love DM as much as anyone else. But this is
pretty blatant that this we would like how much money
you all have left. There are a lot of events that aren’t
going on because of lack of funding, and DM must do
that too.
Petros: I agree with everything Alex said. In addition,
we should follow the recommendations of
Katie: Pro speech?
Parag: DM is one of the most uniting events on campus.
Eliza: as David said, DM brings in a huge amount of
people. And as a Winter event, we should fund this
now.
Katie: Con speech?
Isaac: Last time you came in, we had to move
something immediately to old business, even though
you ended up moving the date. So, I am very unwilling
to fund this amount.
Ronak: As David said, DM will go on. Have the money
go to an event that will not go on if we do not give
them this money.
Katie: pro?
Harrison: If the money is there for us to use and they
could use it, we should grant DM the money.
Dillon: We should not hold grudges against DM due to
what has happened in the past.
David: We did not extend, we pushed back. If we
misled you, I am so sorry but that is not relevant to this
conversation.
GE: I want you to know that by granting this money,
you are taking it away from another group. DM will still
go on with this funding, but other programming will not.
GE: I understand DM is a special case, but we have
standards that we must follow. Precedent is very
important for us and must be followed.
Katie: We are in line with a pro.

David: I don’t disagree with anything that has been said
in the con speeches. I appreciate the standards that
SGC follows, but I also appreciate that Senate does not
have to follow the standards. Just because some
groups, this money will impact them more greatly, but
DM needs money as well. As Petros mentioned, DM
does not really fit into the status roles. This is a special
case that does not really set a precedence. Like with
NCDC and funding candy, it’s breaking the rules, but we
do it anyway.
 Senator: PQ
 Senator: 2nd

• Katie: Next week will be doing the same thing only with A-Status
groups. Thanks to SGC.
• Siddiq: Stay tuned. If you want more information on student
groups, please contact me.
• Petros: Are you going to send it out?
• Siddiq: Yes we will.
New Business: SL1314-04: Northwestern Crew New Boat
• Katie: Anyone here for the SL1314-04?

• Senator: 2nd
• Katie: okay we will move to a vote.
[Passes]
New Business: SL1314-05: $hining a Light on $tudent Activities: An
Assessment of Support for Student Groups
• Sophia: We are asking to create a working group. I thought a lot
about the framework. Student groups are a huge apart of
Northwestern. This working group is to examine that culture. NU is
being looked at to be increased. We want this working group to
examine how the money is being spent and the transparency of it.
We are spelling out a really loose structure, but that is on purpose
so that no one is hypothesizing anything up front. The reason I am,
as AVP am speaking on this, is because there are programming and
academic spaces on campus. And a lot of groups choose to practice
in academic spaces, which I am more proficient on the workings of.
The working group will be overseen by me, Siddiq, and Neel. We
are not there to run the group, but to guide the group. The group
will be made up of SGC, SAFC, Academic and greater NU students.
• Ronak: have you thought about adding a space for a student group
senator?
• Sophia: The NU students can be SG Senators
• Sarah: Will the group be confirmed by Senate?
• Sophia: Yes
New Business: SL1314-06: Dog Therapy Benefitting Northwestern Relay
for Life

Alex: We confirmed the contract with the therapy dogs today, but
we need $50 for Northwestern to be named on Rainbow Therapy
Dog’s insurance. The $100 is a suggested donation fee. Relay For
Life wanted to pair with us as a fundraiser. So if we get the money
for the suggested donation, all other donations will go to Relay For
Life.
• Evan: Since we don’t normally fund donations, can we say that if
we raise $100, that we can get it back?
• Alex: We could not have given them any money last year, but they
probably wouldn’t have come back.
• Dana: Just to clarify, the $150 covers all costs for the event?
• Alex: yes
• Chris: How many people came last year?
• Alex: Over 500 students in two hours. And it was great PR.
• Petros: When was it last year?
• Alex: The Saturday between Reading and Finals week.
• Alex: Will there be fluffy dogs with waggy tails?
• Alex: Yes, and there will be hopefully 2 shifts of dogs?
• Chris: Last year, it was advertised at puppies and it wasn’t.
• Alex: sorry that was PR not me.
• Ani: POI-Can’t bring puppies, because puppies are too fragile.
Good of the Order & Announcements
• Ani: We are handing out member t-shirts tonight. As Abby calls roll,
come up and tell us your name and you can get your shirts.
• Petros: It is transgender awareness week. Next week, there is a
vigil happening, but it is during Senate so you can’t go.
• David: DM trivia t 9pm if you want to come.
o Steven: Hey I am in Stitch and we have fundraiser at Unicorn
this weekend.
• Anna: Exam relief will be happening and we are pairing with the
library. Come to Fitzerland.

Senate 11/20/2013

3/5/14 8:59 AM

Call to Order and Roll Call
Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
Executive Board Reports
Student Group Spotlight: College Republicans’ Freedom Week
Special Order: Typhoon Haiyan Relief Presentation
General Order: 10K Launch Presentation
Old Business: A-Status Funding
Katie: Siddiq do you have anything you’d like to say before we get started?
Siddiq: There are a bunch of organizations that are A status groups that put
on a lot of the big programming on campus. Each AE has a few groups that
they help each year and they go to all the programming that the groups put
on. When funding comes around, they help Student Group leaders put
together a proposal and then we sit down with them and they explain what
they are asking for. Then we go through all the materials and look at the
different tiers they have asked for and based on the quality of the
programming we increase or decrease funding. Things we don’t fund include
food, alcohol and anything exclusive. When we go through all the funding,
we look at all the applications and try to distribute it as fairly as possible. So
that’s the perspective we’re coming from and a little background.
Katie: Any questions? Okay, then we are going to do a cut group first. I’m
going to run through a randomized list of the student groups receiving
funding. Now we’re going to move into an add round.
College Feminists: Motion to add. We’re moving to add $200 dollars to the
Vagina Monologue line item, we originally received $0.
SAFC: We’re comfortable with the $200.
Katie: Anyone have any questions? We’re in line for a pro speech.
Alex: Motion to Previous Question.
Katie: Anyone objecting? All those in favor, all those opposed. Passes
unanimously.
Caribnation: Motion to add. We motion to add $500 dollars to our
honorarium, which is an event to raise awareness about Caribbean culture.
SAFC: We recognize that this is a successful event, but it already received a
4% increase and $500 would not be sustainable.
Katie: Any questions? We are in line for a pro speech.

Caribnation: It’s hard because artists are always expensive and most of the
artist we’ve had have not had much name recognition outside of the
community.
Katie: We’re in line for a con.
Alex: Motion to Previous Question.
Katie: Any objections? All those in favor, all those opposed. The motion
passes. Now we’ll do another cut round. Now we’re open for another add
round.
College Republicans: Motion to add. I want to add $250 to travel.
SAFC: Their winter speaker has only gone on once and we fund consistent
events. It was a good event last year, but they need to prove that they can
do it consistently.
Katie: Questions?
Chris: Can you describe whether they’ve had consistent programming in
general?
College Republicans: We have consistent speakers and the attendance
ranges from 75 to 500 people.
Isaac R: Can you define consistent?
SAFC: It makes more than two and also consistent attendance. They need to
prove that they can do it and that the campus wants it, because there is so
much programming at Northwestern. Last year they used a connection to
get the speaker and we want to make sure it’s not an anomaly.
Alex: Can you explain the Young American Foundation?
College Republicans: I don’t know exactly, but I know they have bee really
helpful. They want to increase public engagement on college campuses. We
don’t know if that source of funding is sustainable.
Katie: We’re in line for a pro speech.
Will: We’ve done this event in the past without attendance so we stopped it,
but we’re trying to bring it back because of our recent momentum and
success of other events.
Katie: We’re in line for a con.
Alex: In line with what the SAFC has said, the fact that it’s only the second
time you put it on and because the YAF has helped you so much with other
events, I think you guys can make do without the funding.

Will: To what you said, I definitely understand what you said. If we keep
going back to them, we don’t want them to take away money from other
speakers. We need to show them that we’re expanding.
SAFC: We do operate on precedent and we want to be fair to all groups. We
try to be conservative and attendance is lower compared to your other
events. We’ll take the success of this year’s event into account.
Alex: Motion to previous question.
Objection.
Withdrawn.
Katie: There is additional time on the con.
Isaac: The YAF is a foundation that is headquartered at the Reagan Ranch in
California with an endowment of over 10 billion dollars. I think the default
answer for new events should continue to be no.
Chris: If you’re going to not give them a funding, do it because of precedent
and not because of Isaac’s personal knowledge of the YAF.
Isaac: It absolutely is appropriate, because we have a pool of money that
goes to student. If one groups does not face scarcity for any reason, then we
should focus the limited resources on where we’d have the most impact.
SAFC: What he’s trying to point out is that we look at need. But we look at
events, not groups. They are a great group, but this event is newer. We
need to adhere to the guidelines.
Alex: Motion to PQ
Katie: All in favor, all opposed. The motion fails. We’re going to continue
with the add round.
Alex: Motion to close funding.
Katie: Any objections? All in favor, all opposed. Funding is closed.
Old Business: SL1314-05: $hining a Light on $tudent Activities: An
Assessment of Support for Student Groups
Sofia: Basically the premise of the group is a working group of six students
that will assess the way the SAF is spent currently and how policies influence
that spending. We want to know what student groups want. Any questions?
Katie: Seeing that there are no questions, we’re going to go to debate. Open
to a con speech and amendments.
Isaac R: You plan to elect the two students today?
Sofia: Yes.

Mark: Motion to amend. Can we change the title to Ss instead of $s?
Katie: Any objections? No objections. All those in favor, all those opposed.
Motion fails.
Isaac H: Motion to previous question.
-: Isn’t it unreasonable to have the election immediately following the
passing of the bill?
Sofia: The timing isn’t the most ideal, but we’ve reached out to people and
there’s been a week for you to reach out to your constituents.
Isaac R: Is there precedent for moving it?
Dana: In the past 2-3 years that has not happened and you would have to
suspend the rules to do so.
Isaac R: Are you looking for students at large or senators?
Sofia: I just want to leave it open, because the most important component is
interest.
Lauren: Are the people being confirmed tonight?
Sofia: Yes.
Katie: All those in favor? All those opposed? It passes. Now we’ll move
immediately into confirmations of the SAFC members.
Siddiq: Our two members we are hoping to confirm are Jason and Amrit.
Amrit: We’ve been involved in a data project to try to get at the bottom of
this. We want to know what money is going to things that aren’t actually
going to programming.
Katie: Does anyone have any questions? Now we’re in line to
Isaac H: I move to suspend the rules and vote on confirmation.
Katie: All in favor, all opposed. The rules have been suspended. All in favor
of confirmation, all opposed. They’re confirmed. SGC members.
Addalina and Danielle: We’re both on the SGC and we are interested
because we are very active in the SGC and part of our conversation there is
how we can most efficiently allocate funds. I think we are particularly good
because Danielle does logistics of programming and I created a database of
our archives and internal logistics, so we understand historical precedent.
Katie: Any questions?
Isaac H: Motion to suspend rules again.
Katie: All in favor, all opposed. Rules suspended. All in favor, all opposed.
Confirmed, congratulations. Now we’ll do in-Senate nominations.
Alex: I nominate Katie McLaughlin.

Katie M: I accept.
Sean: Tori.
Tori: I accept.
Neel: Justin.
Justin: I accept.
Katie F: Any other nominations? The nomination floor is closed.
Katie M: I’m interested in this working group, because I want to get greater
insight into how it works. I’ve been involved in a variety of student groups,
but not on the executive level.
Tori: I’m on the SAFC, but I’m also the treasurer of a B status group and
have a better understanding from that. I’m also part of an organization that
gets outside funding and have had lengthy discussions about how NU
funding is different from other schools. This is very important to me.
Justin: I’m entering my second year as a treasurer of a B status group and
am also the treasurer of an A status group. I’ve been through many funding
cycles and am not a member of ASG.
Katie F: Any questions?
Lauren: Time commitments?
Tori: The groups I mentioned. But I’m only taking three classes and I’m
done in spring.
Justin: Just the two groups I mentioned.
Katie M: Senate and non-exec members of other groups.
Katie F: Any other questions? Seeing none, we’ll move into endorsements.
Old Business: SL1314-06: Dog Therapy Benefitting Northwestern Relay for
Life
Alex: Like we said last week, legislation pays for 50 dollar fee for dog
insurance, and 100 dollars is for suggested donation. Noticed in the past
that we ended up paying out of pocket very often
Maria: Main reason for application is because we will have suggested
donation for ACS of 5 dollars. This money you offer would support more of
the efforts of the ACS, so we don’t have to take it out of pocket and
maximize donations
Alex D.: If funded this year, do we have to do this long term?
Alex V.A.: We would need to pay at least 100 dollars each six months, so we
would need to find a way to make it happen or include in budget
Katie: Questions? [no questions]

Alex: PQ
Katie: We will move to a vote. Passed unanimously.
New Business: SL1314-04: Northwestern Crew New Boat
Kaylee: Operating budget is 80k dues and most of that comes from dues.
Dues are $1500 per year and there is a 2$50 fundraising requirement. It is
obviously a challenge to raise that money. Our budget goes to coaches and
travelling and equipment. As college students our budget, we barely scrape
by each year. We were the only club boat to make it into the finals, but to be
as competitive as possible, we need a new boat. A new racing shell is
$43000. We currently have $11000 in our capital campaign and are in the
beginning stages of a capital campaign. We are asking the ASG project pool
for $2500, but in all honestly, anything would be helpful.
Katie: We have 10 min for questions.
Alex: How many students would use this?
Kaylee: We have 20 varsity members. The 8 is normally rowed by our top 8
varisty women. So, 20 per year. You can expect a boat to last approximately
8 years on the varsity squad and 8 on the novice squad.
Isaac H: Why are you asking now?
Kaylee: We want to put the down payment now so that we can order it and
it’ll be available in the spring when we’ll pay the rest of it off.
Belinda: What is the number of boats you have right now.
Kaylee: We have four eights and five fours.
Belinda:
Kaylee: It comes largely from alumni donations, but our alumni are
relatively young because we’re a relatively new team. We also do
concessions at football games.
Isaac R: Will you need to replace any other boats soon?
Kaylee: We are trying to transition our team, so depending on the success of
the campaign, we might try to look into a boat for the men.
Mark: You said you were selling boats, can you explain that? Have you
approached corporate sponsors?
Kaylee: We had a boat crash a few years ago, so we turned it into a four.
It’s not being used, so we’re hoping to sell that. Because we’re a crew team,
it’s more viable to sell the naming rights to a boat, which is more likely to be
bought by a family. Corporate sponsors aren’t interested in this kind of
thing.

Isaac H: Once you sell the boat, will that be enough for the down payment?
Kaylee: No, we’ll need an additional $5,000.

Senate. Also we have some new Senators, can you please stand up
and introduce yourself?
[Introductions]
• Abby: Thanks for a great quarter
• Ani: There is a list of everyone who joined the new class of PLI in
my exec board report. Check it out.
• Alex: Continue with 10K submissions. Therapy dogs on Sunday. If
you are living a residence hall that is doing cookie chats, let me
know how they are going.
• David: Your mentee or mentor should be scheduling meetings with
you soon. With Senate Reform, we are rethinking the way we are
going about the process, so let me know if you have any thoughts.
• Sofia: Had a meeting with the CTEC committee, possibly redoing
response format due to a poor response rate.
o Chris: Have they considered sending out more reminder
emails?
They are working on various response structures to make it more
beneficial for professors as well as student feedback. They are
definitely taking a more holistic approach. There is also a lot of just
wrapping up for the quarter.
• Kevin: We had the housing fair which you heard about a little more
earlier. We will have another one in January. We also had the
holiday bash, and we are in the middle of debriefing a bunch of
projects. I am going to some alderman meetings this week. If you
want more info, I can fill you in. We were supposed to have ETHS
student government members come in tonight, but they had a
scheduling conflict. Moving forward though, we are looking to make
more of a partnership with them.
• Siddiq: Not much to say this week. We are working to making this
super expansive spreadsheet. We are working with Sheng about
putting a calendar of events of A-status events.

Neel: Not too much happening this quarter. Just starting to prepare
for next quarter and working on solidifying our best common
practices.
• Noah: I have started interviewing new potential committee
members. Please post your books on Book Swap. As ASG, we
should set the example. For those you don’t know, it is an internal
booking buying and selling resource for Northwestern students.
Also, apply for Deering Days.
• Sheng: API is developing on schedule and we will be pushing
CourseSeek next quarter. This means students will be having much
more updated information.

nomination for DTSA. Also, participate in Purple Fridays, it will be
really fun.

• Eliza: I am a new Senator and I sat through 2 funding cycles and
knew I wanted to get involved.

Kaleigh: We are a university club sport and as a crew team we
travel and. We are asking for $4000 for a boat. We are fundraising
and we are looking to get the boat for the spring.
Member: We are a very inclusive environment. We have done many
initiatives and events to involve the community.
Kaleigh: We have an $80,000 budget that
Alex: How long will the boat last?
Kaleigh: It will be on the varsity for 8 years, and then move to the
novice team for 8-10 years. So they last for a long time.
David: Can you talk about where your funding comes from normal?
Kaleigh: we have $1500-1700 dues and we do fundraising on
campus. We also rely a lot on alumni support.
David: Do you know that most fund
Kaleigh: We do get university funding, and we get $10,000 from
the university. If we didn’t get the money from the university, we
would have to raise dues.
Siddiq: Can any student use the boat? How or could this benefit all
students?
Kaleigh: we do not turn away any student who wants to row crew.
Also, the realignment we would be able to do with the new boat will
allow us to have more seats for new students.
Ani: Why are you coming before the aggressive capital campaign
you mentioned you were doing in winter?
Kaleigh: We need half of the money now to order the boat now to
be ready for the spring.
Eliza: What happens if you want to be involved but can’t pay dues?
Kaleigh: There is a CSI fund to subsidize some of the costs, and
you can do more fundraising opportunities to cut off some of your
dues.
Katie: We are moving to debate and moving to a con speech.
Alex: You guys are a great student group, but the money you are
asking for will not be affecting or benefitting many students.
Harrison: Motion to amend amount to $1000.
Senator: 2nd
Harrison: I think the story you are bring forth is very compelling,
but I think this is much more acceptable amount to pass.

Alex: Objection. This is still a lot of money to be asking from the
SAF that will benefit very few students. This amendment will
increase chances
Isaac: I have a question for alex. Is there any amount you would be
willing to pass?
Alex: No.
Eliza: Would you still be able to meet your goal you think if you
only got $1000?
Kaleigh: It would be possible but that is harder.
Evan: would you be willing to come back after your fundraising
efforts in the winter?
Kaleigh: Yes, but I think this is the best time to ask for this money.
We need to purchase the boat as soon as we can.
Alex: PQ
[amendment passes]
Siddiq: Would students have the opportunity to use the boat too, or
just crew members?
Kaleigh: We are looking to have some fundraising efforts to teach
students how to row after our season ends in the spring.
Noah: Motion to amend. Any money that is not used to purchase
the racing shell would be returned to the pool. I think this is a good
cause, but we don’t know how much the capital campaign will raise
so whatever money you don’t need will be returned.
Alex: Object. I just don’t think this is very realistic. If they are
trying to fundraise, we just give them the money or you don’t.
Katie: Pro speech?
Dana: I disagree. They will try to raise as much money as they can
and then if they have money left over it should be returned.
Alex: PQ
[amendment passes]
Katie: We are in line for a pro speech.
Dana: We have talked a lot about the amount of students that this
would be helping. This boat will have a much longer longevitiy than
many other things we fund on boats. And over time we would fund

Ani: There is something also to be said for that this group has high
prestige and goes out to represent Northwestern. We take a lot of
pride in this group, and we have the opportunity to help them
Katie: Con speech.
David: I wish you the best of luck on raising the money. I would
like to say that historically, I don’t think we have every funded a
club team. This money should be going to student groups that do
not have that funding access. However, going off what Ani said, it is
Katie: Pro speech.
Jamie: This is a group that normally does not receive funding, so
this a great opportunity to do so.
Eliza: this boat does have a long lifespan. They have 16 years of
boat use to expand use to northwestern students.
Katie: con speech
Petros: There is no assurance that the boat will be put to the
correct use until 2029. I think this pool could be used to for groups
who need it more and that would have more accountability.
Isaac: Is there any money in athletics available for capital
improvements?
Kaleigh: No not really. That’s why we are here.
Alex: We are giving up 1/10 of our budget for 1/43 of the boat.
Also, they may be trying to sell their boat.
Kaleigh: Our goal is trying to expand the program. We do not want
to sell our current 8 because we would like to expand the program.
Sarah: So any student can join the team?
Kaleigh: Yes, if you make it through your novice year, you are on
the varsity team.
Isaac: How have you historically raised money?
Kaleigh: Mostly with donors and alumni.
Chris: Hypothetically, if you don’t get this money, how long do you
have to order the boat, as well as if you do.
Kaleigh: We need to order the boat by January 1st, we need $2500
more. If we don’t have the money by then, we may not get the
boat until fall.
Chris: would it be more helpful to have a down payment that you
must pay back?

Kaleigh: I am not sure but I don’t think so.
Katie: Pro speech.
Harrison: If you remember Henry Brooke, a senator from last year
on a club team, he felt that ASG helped club teams. This is a
chance to do that.
• Parag: This money would help get money ready early so we should
do this now. I see this as an investment for the crew team.
• Katie: Con speech.
• Siddiq: This group will still function without this funding, while
many other groups on campus will not. And while the Crew team is
incredible, there are groups that cannot function without this
money.
• Alex: Again, this money I don’t think has the benefit to justify the
cost.
• Katie: We are in moving to a vote.
[legislation passes]
New Business: SL1314-07: Hoop for Haiyan
• Arshad: Hi everyone. This is a request for a fundraising basketball
effort to raise money for Haiyan. Just to clarify, no groups have
been tied to this event but things are going. I think this is an
opportunity to really energize students towards a great cause.
Based upon quotes, I have given an exact amount for the event.
This is large amount from the pool, but I think this event could be
really great. I think that this could raise about $5000. The Athletics
office cannot be financially involved, but they are getting involved
in the event and have student athletes to help facilitate the day.
The president’s office is also able to give funding, because I am just
a single student. The tournament can be up to 112 participants
based upon the bracket to set up. There will be a registration fee
and you will get a t-shirt. All the left over t-shirts and water bottles
will be sold. The plan is pretty thoroughly laid out. The money will
be going directly to effort groups and not an umbrella organization.
• Katie: 10 minutes for questions
• Dana: You mentioned the Hoop for Haiti event. Did they have tshirts and stuff?

Arshad: They did have t-shirts, but local sponsors paid for the
shirts. Given the short time span, we don’t have too much time for
it.
Chris: would the event still go on without the funding?
Arshad: Yes, but it would not be as profitable. Also the t-shirts help
create an outward appearance of this event is for a cause.
Evan: Could you elaborate on the $200 fee for PR? Don’t we know
have $50 PR budget for groups?
Arshad: This was just an estimate, and I would be open to be
lowering it if you are more comfortable with that.
Luke: how early do you need the money?
Arshad: We need 2 weeks for the t-shirts and water bottles.
Luke: So you can’t wait to pass this next Senate?
Arshad: No. We would need to make this old business tonight.
Senator: have you thought that about only selling the shirts?
Arshad: I am not sure the costs would be less than the profits that
way.
Dana: why did you pick two items to sell. It ups the costs.
Arshad: for the sake of variety I guess.
Korri: Who is your target market for the 88 shirts.
Arshad: supporters of those playing and then selling them outside
Kellogg if they don’t sell after the tournament.
Chris: What other areas have you gone to ask for money other than
athletics and president’s office and what did you do to minimize
costs?
Arshad: I haven’t really but I would like to make this a campus
wide event to unify campus. I want this to be unaffiliated to make it
as campus wide as possible. I also did my own research to get the
best prices to minimize costs.
Katie: We have time for one more question.
Chris: Motion to extend question period by 5 minutes.
Franco: This is just a single event?
Arshad: No I was just modeling after Hoop for Haiti.
Franco: So what is the purpose of having t-shirts and water bottles
to advertise a single event?
Arshad: the relief efforts are ongoing even if the tournament is not.

Alex: How long has the tournament been in the planning process?
Arshad: 3 weeks
Dana: Why are you holding it so soon? Also, no sorority women will
be able to participate and you can get more sponsorships to fund.
• Arshad: It was just earlier in the quarter, so people are less busy.
But that is the a good point about sorority women.
• Senator: What corporate sponsorships have you looked at?
• Arshad: I have looked at those who are were involved in Haiti and
new businesses.
• Parag: Could you push back the event to get corporate
sponsorships?
• Arshad: Yes, but we would still need to money from ASG to fund
the event.
• Katie: Okay this is old business in January.
• Harrison: Motion to move this to old business. I think he explained
why this is needed to be made old business.
• Chris: We also can use this time to amend appropriately.
• Katie: Con speech.
• Isaac: I think we need time to talk to our constituents and you may
need time to figure out some other details.
• Alex: We are in an awkward position, but I think we need the extra
time.
• Katie: Okay, we are in line for a pro speech.
• Petros: I think by holding the event as soon as possible to have the
most effective event.
• Katie: Con speech.
• Evan: I am fully in support with this event, but I think we have
seen that there are issues with this date. So, we could use this as a
chance to move
• Arshad: I also just want to mention that I would have to redo that
paperwork for Student athletes to be involved.
• Alex: PQ

Evan: The World Cup is one of the largest watched sporting event
in the world. We have locked in the McCormick theater in Norris.
We would need $50 for chips and food. I have talked to ISA and NU
World Cup about PR costs and Einstein’s about free bagels. I think
this could be a great event that embodies what the project pool is
for.
Harrison: We are sorry to have to make it old business tonight, but
we the selection party would have to be on Friday and there was no
Senate last week.
Katie: 10 minutes for questions.
Alex: What kind of food?
Evan: Orange juice, cream cheese
Senator: Can you eat in the McCormick theater?
Evan: worst comes to worst, we can eat outside.
Parag: Motion to make this old business?
Alex: 2nd
Alex: PQ
David: objection
Alex: withdrawn
Katie: con speech
David: this is a great idea, but a terrible use of project money. If it
is integral to the event, that is one thing, but not the feed
attendees. If we wouldn’t fund a student group for it, we shouldn’t
fund it now.
Katie: Pro speech
Petros: I love the World Cup and that I think it would bring together
students.
Alex: I think they have done a great job of taking initiative to get
free bagels.
Kevin: Why do you need the money if you have bagels.
Evan: we need drinks and cream cheese.
Katie: Con speech
Ani: I think this is a great event, even from a mental health
prospective of giving money out. Also, I think it was a bit
presumptuous that I have already received advertising that said
ASG is sponsoring it.

Noah: This money is not sponsoring an event, but to feed students
chips. We should be helping new events happen, not funding
extras.
• Alex: Can you further elaborate on the advertising issue?
• Harrison: I’m sorry that was a miscommunication on our part with
NU World Cup on how project pool funding work.
• Evan: Maybe they meant that Harrison and I are working with them
on behalf of ASG.
• Katie: Pro speech.
• Harrison: I think Ani brought up a lot of issues that should be
addressed. As you can see, we are very surprised by the
advertising. Also, this is not haphazard. We have been planning this
out for a while, but there was no Senate last week to bring up.
• Katie: Con speech
• Sofia: I think in terms of fundraising the pool is an outlet and there
are funding outlets on campus that ISA has relations with for you to
go to. There are B-Status whose complete focus is food and that is
the purpose that put in a concerted effort to fundraise even though
their programming is centered around food. This event will happen
regardless and the event is not about food, it is about the World
Cup.

• Alex: 2nd
