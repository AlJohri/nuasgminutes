	•	Olivia: I accept. 
	•	Alec: I nominate myself!
	•	Dana: I’m dana. I’m the parliamentarian (not a conflict of interest!) I was the election commissioner last year, and before that i was on the commission. At this point i’m pretty much ready for anything. 
	•	Jake: I’m jake,im good under pressure because theater and auditions and shit like that. I’m a freshman and dont know many people who are running, so it’s easier for me to be impartial.
	•	Nehaarika: I’m on rules right now, i’m a fan fo the code.
	•	Matt: I’m a sophomore, first year on asg. it’s time for me to get more involved. I think it’s important to take an interest in the elections and making sure they are run well. I’m an RA this year, i’ve had to balance a lot of interests this year. [giants fan nonsense]
	•	OLauren: i am good under pressure. 
	•	oliviia: i’m a freshman,very new to this. i like to think im decent under pressure.
	•	Alex: this is my second year as a senator, i was on the commisssion last year.
	•	Noah: question
	•	Isaac: Can the election commission do anything to make elections less messy? 
	•	Jake: I have not read the actual policies yet, and would need to do that. from what i have seen of advertising in gheneral, theres a lot of flyers in wasted places where people step and i think we can be more evironmendally frinedly.
	•	Nehaarika: because it’s part of government, i think we can streamline it
	•	Matt: i dont really knw how the election was run
	•	lauren: i think last years was pretty un-messy, and i thnk that was because we shortened the time frime. i thinkthat was good. at the same time, i think we can make some things simpler.
	•	olivia: i haven’t picked up the guidelines yet but i’m sure we can make them simpler. 
	•	alex: i agree with lauren. from my perspective it wasn’t messy
	•	Dana: what do you mean messy?
	•	isaac: messy to the point that bad things occur
	•	Dana: Iv’e been on the commisssion for one contentionus election and one less contentious one. we didn’t have any violations last year and i think that’s because we clealry told every candidate our expecations and made ourselves available to everyone. people don’t want to commmit violations. i like to think of the commisssion as a resource. when i was on the commission, each person was assigned to a campaign.
	•	What’s a creative debate qyestion you’d want to ask?
	•	Nehaarika: what are some negative experiences that have led you to better conflict resolution methods?
	•	matt: what is your relation with your running mate and why did you choose him? why are you wearing what you are wearing?
	•	lauren: what is one isssue that has not been in the spotlight this year that you would like to address?
	•	alex: who is your biggest role model?
	•	dana: this isn’t creative either: one problem is that every campaign tries to tackle all issues, so that each campaign looks the same. so my question
