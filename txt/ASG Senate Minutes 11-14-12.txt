	•	Girish: Hopefully shouldn't take too long. We'll be going through add and cut rounds- you'd cut for any number of reasons, including if you didn't think the event was good, it doesn't help the NU community, etc.

	•	Motion to previous question

	•	Girish: Most current spreadsheet was sent out?

	•	April: Motion to add $200 in funding to the line item of camera.
	•	Ani: Please come up and speak on the motion
	•	April: Justin's not here…
	•	Ani: we'll do it in the second add round then...
	•	Peace Project
	•	Cory: Motion to add $300 to the Spring Speaker Honorarium
	•	Cory: Last night, Peace Project did great programming like Damien Echols who was wrongly convicted and released.  Not a huge impact to our pool, but can make the difference as to whether or not we can get quality guests like that again.
	•	SAFC Opinion (Girish): Last night's event was co-sponsored with NCDC and we can't really judge co-sponsorships since it's hard to see which group did the most work. We already funded them generously considering the previous allocation
	•	Ani: Questions
	•	Mark: How much did it cost to bring last night's speaker?
	•	Amalia: $10,000
	•	Cory: Point of Clarification- I used last night's speaker as an example of what kinds of speakers Peace Project can bring, not as direct standard for comparing this event to the one from last night.
	•	Ian: Is this funding a co-sponsorship?
	•	Girish: This is a different event- this event is not a co-sponsorship
	•	Ani: Moving into debate on the amendment, now in line for a con
	•	Ian H: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- approved.
	•	Dana: Wait, what happened? Can we do that vote again?
	•	Girish: Ok, you voted to add those funds from the amendment pool.
	•	Tori: Can we reconsider?
	•	Girish: Motion to suspend the rules and reconsider
	•	Vote- confusion. Then approved by Division.
	•	Yea- 21
	•	Nay- 16
	•	Abstentions-1
	•	Kaibigan
	•	Special Olympics
	•	Rainbow Alliance
	•	College Feminists
	•	Caribnation
	•	NCDC
	•	Amalia: Motion to add $300 to Spring Advocacy Honorarium
	•	Amalia: I'm one of the co-chairs of NCDC- would like to get speakers in the $3000-$5000 range- will enhance this event to a greater caliber.
	•	SAFC Opinion (Tori): Event was actually funded at a $10 increase to keep it stable. Hard to tell how well this event went since previous years were co-sponsorships. Not in line for an increase this year, maybe next year
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Mark: Amalia, do you have any further motions this evening
	•	Amalia: No
	•	Sarah: Changes between when you co-sponsored this event and now?
	•	Amalia: FMO just donated money when they were a co-sponsor, last year we pretty much put it on by ourselves
	•	Sarah: Trying to get an idea of change between years?
	•	Amalia: Did it all ourselves following separation from FMO
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Amalia (pro): This range is key to get great speakers- last night's event was great- hope you'll give us these funds to put on a great event.
	•	SAFC (con): Attendance dropped between years- can only consider it when they did it alone. Can only reward changes in attendance- if this group were to put on this event again and then seek funding from us, we would be much more open to this request.
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- fails. Amendment is defeated.

	•	Motoki: Motion to cut $300 to the Spring Speaker Honorarium
	•	Motoki: Before we added to this event, this event was at an 11% increase, this moves it to a 38% increase and the size of this increase is absurd and unsustainable.
	•	Rebecca: We already passed this with this knowledge.
	•	Ani: Yes, this is asked and answered. Motion denied.
	•	Ian: Motion to cut $200 to the Spring Speaker Honorarium
	•	Ian: Will still be well over the growth of the pool- people in this room may want to scale this back a little since they do seem to want to fund the event, though perhaps not this much.
	•	Alex Lower: Can we amend changes? Like could someone have motioned to change the amount?
	•	sgn
	•	Rebecca: Objection
	•	Jesse: Can we vote to not hear this?
	•	Jesse: Yes, following pro/con
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con on the motion
	•	Ian C (pro): doesn't make sense across the board to fund at this level of increase
	•	Jesse (con): Agree in principle- but against this because it's redundant and we already decided this. It's asked and answered.
	•	Hannah (con): originally voted against the increase, but we need to stand by our decision.
	•	Alex Lower (pro): part of the democratic process to consider all options fully
	•	Tori (pro): The facts that we didn't go through pro/con and PQ justifies bringing this back to the floor
	•	Girish: This is a loose funding cycle- usually with tighter rounds, we'd go over the amount we'd have and need to use cut rounds to get back in the black
	•	Cory (con): We're very far in the black- ridiculous to be this up in arms about such a small amount when it'd mean a great deal to peace project.
	•	Rebecca (con): We did PQ it, and a lot of people aren't new. Sorry, but we passed this, it's a second chance to give the opposition an opportunity to shoot this down.
	•	Ian H: Point of Clarification: I called PQ because the floor was dead...
	•	Point of information- SAFC Opinion hasn't happened before
	•	Motoki (pro): Want to consider each case of funding on it's merit, not based on the size of the pool. Should hear the rest of this
	•	Girish (pro): The con that this gives the opposition a chance to respond is a good thing, makes a better decision. And Motoki is right- by giving out more money now, you're doing large disservice to groups in the next cycle.
	•	Jesse (con): we're looking at the pool now, weren't looking at it before.
	•	Moving to a vote on hearing this amendment
	•	Vote- approved. Amendment will be heard on the floor.
	•	Ian: People probably didn't want to give them so much money- we should discuss it again
	•	Ani: Questions on the amendment?
	•	Nouha: What would be the change in the amount of funding given?
	•	Ian: would be giving  additional 100 moving funding for the event from 400 to 500
	•	Senator: What percent increase would that be then?
	•	Would be a 20% increase
	•	SAFC Opinion: We spend hours debating on these amounts- we've allocated groups more now than ever. We had extra money this year to give
	•	Logan (pro): 11% is a high increase- this would signal to other groups to apply for more funds and would drain the spring pool.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- approved. Funds are cut.

	•	Motion to add $300 to line item camera
	•	Justin: We need a camera- it's a pain having to borrow cameras or get them through other means.
	•	SAFC Opinion: When we look at funding for administrative expenses, we have to treat all student groups the same. Since cameras are available at the library for renting, we chose not to approve this request
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	April: How many cameras available for rent at the library?
	•	Tori: 6 or more
	•	Rebecca: Have you tried to rent a camera previously
	•	Justin: Not tried the library- other means
	•	Noah: What is the procedure and cost associated with obtaining a camera?
	•	Tori: Only fee involved with the process is if you're late in returning it
	•	Ian H: Is this the cycle when we'd usually fund this sort of thing?
	•	Tori: Supplemental is usually the cycle we use to fund capital improvements
	•	Girish: this is when we would fund this
	•	Sofia: Average demand for these cameras?
	•	Tori: I work in the library- it varies. Most have their own cameras- they're rarely all checked out and come out fairly quickly
	•	Evan: Is it usually groups that check these out?
	•	Tori: we've never funded cameras or camcorders since I've been here
	•	Ian H: Reservation system for cameras?
	•	Can reserve cameras up to a month in advance and can extend duration of rental
	•	Ani: Pro/con for this amendment
	•	Ian C (con): Sounds like there are sufficient resources in the library, we don't need to fund this.
	•	Mike: Would be more interested in funding this as an investment to all students, rather than one group
	•	Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- fails. Funds are not allocated.

	•	SAFC: Thanks for the shortest funding cycle ever!

III. New Business: SL1213-13: Services Committee and Vice President Code Reform
	•	Noah: It's Services- watch out!
	•	Noah: This legislation makes Services VP position have similar structure to every other position on exec and brings the code in line with current practices
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Hannah: Reasons for why the code was messed up?
	•	Brad: Was the newest position on the executive board- in the past, each VP would manage their own services. When this position was created, the leadership at the time didn’t want this new position to step on everyone's toes, so they put a lot of restriction on the position. We knew that bringing this before you guys was a risk, because if you vote this down we'll actually have to start following the guidelines the way they are now. The current procedure hasn't been followed because it's incredibly unproductive and would definitely slow progress.
	•	Ian: Motion to move this to old business
	•	Ian: Really being terrible with the code in this state- Rules would've corrected it through code review if it wasn't so large.
	•	Ani: Moving to pro/con on moving this to old business
	•	Jane (con): should have David here to speak on this
	•	Hannah (con): changing the code is significant- should have the person affected by this here
	•	Rebecca (pro): breaking the code is more significant, we need to make this change now.
	•	Noah (pro): we're acting in violation of the code, successfully so. David is fine with this passing through old business.
	•	Ian H (con): didn't get a chance to read this closely, wanted to focus on funding...
	•	Ani: Not an excuse
	•	Jane (con): Big code change, we should consider this further.
	•	Rebecca (pro): how long will "being a new senator" be an excuse?
	•	Ian (pro): this code change is de facto- we need to have our official documents in line
	•	Sarah (con): Need time to look at this and make sure we can look at this to ensure it'll be successful
	•	Ani: In line for a vote on moving this to old business
	•	Vote- division
	•	Yea: 22
	•	Nay: 13
	•	Abstentions: 2
	•	Approved- legislation is now old business.
	•	Noah: Code as it is makes it so exec has to approve everything we do. Would be incredibly inefficient.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Senator: Are we sure that it isn't best to leave the code as it is and start voting on what projects Services takes on?
	•	Brad: Not in current practices to vote on everything the services committee does
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Brad (pro): Services VP is the second newest exec position- when the position was proposed, exec was afraid that services would step on the toes of other VPs territory- wanted to make sure that the Services VP didn't overstep their bounds- wanted to prevent a new position from dominating the exec board. Would be a major waste to the exec boards time to approve every service. David knew he was taking a risk in bringing this to the floor- we as exec fully support this legislation.
	•	Motoki: Would you say that the Services committee has overstepped their bounds in the past couple years?
	•	Brad: consulted with academics and student life whenever that's happened.
	•	Alex Lower: Doesn't this remove accountability?
	•	Brad: Services is currently accountable to the entire exec board, which is shared by no other exec position
	•	Motoki: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Code is amended.
