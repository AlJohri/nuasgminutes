ASG Senate Minutes
02-20-13

	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	Victor: Thanks to those of you who came out to the NU Harlem Shake on Sunday- that's our practice run for the larger campus wide music video that we'll be talking to PTI about. We'll also be having focus groups about UCS next week- please respond to the email we'll be sending out if you're interested and have experiences with UCS, good or bad. DSTA apps are down to the final few, selecting soon- and One Book One Northwestern book will be selected in the next month.
	•	Brad: Met with Kelly Schafer, new executive director of the Norris center. Talked about a lot of ideas, including a staff member that checks Campus Voice everyday for Norris issues- hope this expands. Also will have presentation from David about Cab Corner soon that he wanted me to tell you all to look out for.
	•	Alex: Therapy dogs will be happening- read my exec board report for various updates, let me know if you have any questions.
	•	Neil: Want to reiterate what Victor said about UCS, check out faculty honor roll and forward it out to people.
	•	Steven: Off-Campus office confirmed we'll have an apartment/sublet search service next quarter- thanks to off-campus office for that!
	•	Ethan: HEY EVERYBODY! Read my exec board report!
	•	Carly: Please respond to your OM about coffee chats- everyone eats lunch, contact Emily Schraudenbach. Senator spotlight for Alex Lower- his proposal to have NU radio playing in dining halls was fantastic and a great idea to implement.
	•	Victor: Hayley wanted us to pass on that we have a proposal for a diversity requirement- going to faculty senate for a vote next.
	•	Ian: I can talk a little bit more on this- the proposal will be released to student body on Monday- this proposal needs to go through the faculty senate- we'll be arranging trainings for students to go to school admin and tell them why this requirement is important to the Northwestern curriculum. More info will be coming.
	•	Brandon: By my records there are three people who cannot vote tonight due to an absence last week: Kevin, Corrine, & Sean. You also cannot vote if you are subbing for someone.
	•	General Order: Director of Residential Life Confirmation
	•	Alex: Been utilizing director positions to promote members of my committee to have a leadership position. Anna’s been on the committee since last spring and is really driven and would be great for this position. Needs to be confirmed for this position since she will be speaking on behalf of residential life.
	•	Ani: Questions about the position?
	•	Ian: What do you envision this role overseeing?
	•	Alex: The equivalent of Paul Riehl, would be meeting with him on a regular basis to keep a pulse on residential issues and know what's going on with residential life and taking the lead on residential life projects. Would be my sort of go to person for residential life projects that come up.
	•	Rebecca: Term period?
	•	Alex: As long as she wants to be in this position or as long as she's on the committee and wishes to maintain this position.
	•	Brad: To clarify our committee structure- our committees are staffed by our Executive Vice President, it's up to the sitting Executive Vice President to determine whether directors are still relevant.
	•	Anna: I'm a Junior in the School of Communications- I've done a lot with athletics, parking, residential services on several projects. I don't see my role as being another Alex, but as a right hand to Alex. I'm really excited about it.
	•	Ani: Questions for Anna?
	•	Ian: How do you plan on working with RHA and RCB?
	•	Anna: Paul will be very helpful- initially I'll let him take the reigns, but when I get a better feel for both groups, I'll be able to have a better handle for communicating with them and will work with both groups effectively.
	•	Alex: Residential forum next week will be good to start this communication.
	•	Ani: Moving into a discussion/debate period.
	•	X: ResLife is near and dear to my heart- wasn't the best answer, but I trust Alex.
	•	X: Anna was my PA and she was super on top of her game and I'm sure she'd be great.
	•	X: I worked with her, she's incredibly goal-oriented and likable, which I think is important for this position.
	•	X: She does work really well with people and gets stuff done since she's able to connect really well.
	•	X: Want to reiterate- her responsibility is to students, not Paul Riehl, and her ability to work with RHA and RCB is paramount.
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote on confirming Anna.
	•	Vote- passed. Anna is confirmed as the ASG Student Life Director of Residential Life.
	•	General Order: Campaign Reform Survey
	•	Abby: Our committee was formed 3 weeks ago, looked at COFHE schools of various sizes in various metrics- from there we met and created a survey to see what you all want in the election process. In the agenda, you all received a link to the survey- we broke it down into different categories. Just want to get an idea of what you guys think would be best for the election period going forward.
	•	Brad: Are you saying you're opposed to having the entire campus running for election commission?
	•	Motoki: We tried to throw out our ideas about what the process is like now and wanted to know what Senators think.
	•	Abby: If you have feedback about this, we'd love to hear about it in the comments section.
	•	Abby: I'll go through the survey...
	•	General Order: Financial & Student Group VP Selection Committee Senator Election
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Katie: Timeline for selection?
	•	Girish: For mine, this weekend, or early next week. Not a huge time commitment
	•	Lauren: Probably next week is when interviews will happen.
	•	Ani: Opening the floor for nominations
	•	Tori: I nominate Patrick.
	•	Patrick: I accept.
	•	Senator: I nominate Katie.
	•	Katie: I accept.
	•	Ani: Introduce yourselves
	•	Patrick: I'm a Junior and just finished my obligation with the community engagement grant ad hoc and want to have a place influencing the future of student groups at Northwestern.
	•	Katie: My second year in Senate- I'm a student groups Senator representing NCDC. Student groups Senators have a vested interest in ensuring the FVP is quality and would be glad to be involved in the selection process.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian: What A-status groups are you a large part of and are there any conflicts of interest?
	•	Katie: I'm in NCDC, but pride myself on being objective and have been in other positions. Most interested that future leadership is most qualified.
	•	Patrick: I'm on the leadership of A&O and Mayfest, but think it's good that I'm not a student groups Senator.
	•	Girish: In 30 seconds or less, what does the FVP do?
	•	Patrick: The FVP is a coordinator and communicator who oversees funding and ensures good communication between groups and ASG.
	•	Katie: Needs to oversee guidelines, manage misconducts, know what they're doing with money, be impartial.
	•	Ani: Moving into a discussion period.
	•	X: Want to endorse Katie- she gave the better answer, been on Rules, her experience as a student group Senator is important- I know she'll be impartial and she's a quality person.
	•	X: want to echo X's words- the fact that she's a student group Senator means that she likely interacts more with SAFC and Katie would have a better handle on choosing a good FVP.
	•	Ani: Opening the floor for nominations for a Senator for the SGC selection committee.
	•	Alex Lower: I nominate Motoki.
	•	Motoki: I accept.
	•	Ani: Nomination period is closed.
	•	Senator: Motion to white ballot.
	•	Ani: Need to give at least one speech before we can white ballot.
	•	Ani: Please tells us a bit about why you're interested in being on this selection committee.
	•	Motoki: I'm the longest standing Senator in Senate, I'm on SGC and think I'm qualified to help select the next SGVP.
	•	Senator: Motion to white ballot.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Motoki is on the SGVP selection committee.
	•	Ani: Votes have been counted- Katie won the election for the FVP selection committee spot.
	•	General Order: Firearm Regulation Ad-hoc Committee Letter Presentation
	•	Alexander: Been working on this letter for the last couple weeks- we're going to send this letter as Northwestern University, but will be contacting other schools to get their support. Wanted to give a chance to Senate to look over the letter before we submitted anything.
	•	Steven: Let me or Alex know if you have any major suggestions, we'll start talking to others tomorrow, barring any major objections. This draft is endorsed by all members of the committee
	•	Ani: Any questions on the letter? Send comments to the authors.
	•	Old Business: SR1213-10: Administration Transparency
	•	Harrison: Motion to move this up on the agenda to now.
	•	Harrison: A lot of people here to talk about this- funding will take a while and want to get this voted on.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Motoki (con): A lot of student group leaders here waiting for funding as well.
	•	Ian (con): Funding is an essential part of ASG- a resolution isn't. Prioritizing  a resolution over funding isn't acceptable.
	•	Aaron (pro): These people are taking time out of their days- I have to leave at 9, if you could do me a favor, please spare me and my friends from sitting through funding.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote-
	•	Ay- 22
	•	Nay- 8
	•	Abstentions- 4
	•	Vote- fails. This agenda item Is not moved up
	•	Old Business: B-Status Funding
	•	Lauren: We've changed some of the recommendations which are listed- need to vote on these amendments.
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote on the amendments.
	•	Vote- passed. Amendments are implemented.
	•	Ani: Moving into the first cut round.

	•	Pablo: Motion to add $50 to line item Sternos and Sternostands.
	•	Pablo: I manage outreach for ISA World Cup, we invite every cultural group on campus. Our request was cut down to half, so an additional $50 would be good.
	•	Ani: SGC Opinion?
	•	Paul: We recommended $150 since it's their first time applying and their application was late.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Senator: What was the problem with the application submission?
	•	Paul: Didn't cc Lauren on it, so their application ended up not getting reviewed in the first round of initial hearings.
	•	Mark: What's the exact problem with their application?
	•	Lauren: Application wasn't cc'ed to me- seems simple, but caused a lot of extra meetings and deliberation, had to plan two additional meetings since it was vague as well.
	•	Ian: Is it SGC policy to fully fund a new line item?
	•	Lauren: Generally no- we know this event and have seen it be successful, but we've never funded it ourselves and have no point of reference for judging it's  successfulness when funded by us.
	•	Brad (point of information): Came before Senate with a project pool request for this event previously because they missed the application deadline and didn't get additional funding from us.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con.
	•	Ian (con): An incorrect submission this year and a missed submission last year, it seemed to go well without us last year and will still go well with less funding from us this year.
	•	Pablo (pro): We hope to improve and expand the event- I'm part of the organization and take responsibility, but wasn't personally accountable for this problem
	•	Alexander (con): $50 is a third of someone's activity fee- it's important.
	•	Paul: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- fails. Additional funds are not added to line item.

	•	Boomshaka        
	•	ISA World Cup
	•	ISA World Cup 1: Motion to add $100 for goals
	•	ISA World Cup 1: Largest student run athletic event at NU- have students from all over campus- we need two extra goals. It's annoying to keep up with two broken goals on the day of the tournament and want to have as many fields playing as possible to ensure things run smoothly.
	•	ISA World Cup 2: We will reuse these every year.
	•	Ani: SGC opinion?
	•	Motoki: Just received B-status a month back- usually fund newer groups more conservatively. Also didn't fund this last year, didn't see a reason to fund when they can just rent from the university. Felt comfortable funding one of the goals, not two.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Jane: Have you looked into fixing them?
	•	ISA World Cup 1: Don't have specifics on the goals, another committee handles this- the two goals were cheaper and some of the goals were handmade
	•	Mark: Could the SGC or ISA talk about goal rentals?
	•	ISA World Cup 1: We tried working with Athletics, but they've been uncooperative with us and don't like to rent us soccer balls
	•	Alex (question): If you plan on buying goals this year, how do you plan on storing them between years
	•	ISA World Cup 2: Will be stored in MCC.
	•	Ian: Should you be funded money for an extra goal, can you see a way to give these to other student groups throughout the year?
	•	ISA World Cup 2: Wouldn't be against it I guess.
	•	Ian: Let me rephrase- have you loaned goals to other groups in the past?
	•	ISA World Cup 1: No.
	•	Aaron: Is there a registration fee and where does that fee go?
	•	ISA World Cup 1: $7 and goes toward our programming and other events. It's very valuable to us and is used for other things.
	•	Mark: Can you explain how these goals were damaged and how you'll prevent this in the future?
	•	ISA World Cup 1: Mainly just wear and tear- the goals we have just aren't that great. The ones we're looking into getting this year would be more durable.
	•	Mark: What you're describing seems repairable?
	•	ISA World Cup 2: Hard for us to say since we weren't the ones who checked them- they're likely dented and makes it difficult to put them together.
	•	Evan: You said all your goals are in mediocre state- is there any way to prevent this from happening every year?
	•	ISA World Cup 1: As we said, we're going to try and buy more durable goals and likely won't come back more goals since we feel like our other goals are in fine condition.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Motoki (con): Want to be conservative with new groups
	•	David: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- passed. Additional funding is approved.
	•	ISA World Cup 1: Motion to add $100 for a medic as well.
	•	ISA World Cup 1: We have 450 people registered to play in the spring, 2-day event- it's $25 per hour, so we're asking for money to fund a medic for an additional 4 hours.
	•	ISA World Cup 2: Medic last year was swamped and difficult to find.
	•	Ani: SGC opinion?
	•	Lauren M: Same reasoning- we support safety, but they're a new group and need to hold them to same standard as any other group that's applying for the first time. Don't think that not funding this will mean they won't get a medic- they'll get one and will just have to make cuts elsewhere.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Senator: You mentioned in the application that this is in line with previous allocations- were they allotted this same amount last year?
	•	Lauren: We tend to look back at previous applications, we tried to make it as fair as possible.
	•	Jane: Have you thought about upping your entrance cost to cover the medic?
	•	ISA World Cup 1: We've actually increased it already- we want to keep the registration cost low so that everyone who wants to get involved can get involved.
	•	Jane: Have you thought about cutting costs in other areas?
	•	ISA World Cup 1: Like Lauren said, we'll have a medic, we're just asking for a little more support.
	•	ISA World Cup 2: Some of the concern is that you guys don't want to fully cover our budget- we have a budget of around $10,000, we have other offices funding the bulk of our expenses, this would be supplementary
	•	Alexander: Have you thought about first aid training for students for less serious things?
	•	ISA World Cup 1: No- but good idea, haven't thought of before.
	•	Ian: Have you considered partnering with Feinberg to have an alumna to help manage this?
	•	ISA World Cup 2: Relatively new program, still building alumna network, but we could look into that as well.
	•	Jane: Have you gone to other donors about funding this?
	•	ISA World Cup 1: Lots of other aspects not included here that need to be taken into account that they're covering.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con.
	•	Jane (con): We've already funded them an additional $100, seems like they could get other sources of funding doesn't make sense, and they're a new group.
	•	Angela (con): We already funded them $100- there are many other places they could go for this sort of support.
	•	Paul: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- fails. Additional funding is not approved.

	•	Relay for Life
	•	Relay for Life 1: Motion to add $100 items to line item for photo booth rental
	•	Relay for Life 1: We had this event for the past 8 years- we'd get the photo booth for entire night, it's essential to our programming and is essential to celebrating those who've survived cancer. As an investment, we've talked to many vendors to get the cost down, we'll be fundraising a lot of this as well. Better for liability than bounce house and saves us from doing a lot of paperwork.
	•	Ani: SGC Opinion?
	•	Lauren: While the event isn't new, the photo booth rental is new. We're being conservative in case this doesn't work out. We try to be a supplementary funding pool to events, we don't see the photo booth as essential to the event happening.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Jane: Have you looked at other sources of funding besides ACS and ASG?
	•	Relay for Life 2: We try to keep our overhead costs low and most of our other costs are donated.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Lauren (con): We recommend funding at half for this year due to constraints of the pool.
	•	Lauren M (con): We are really limited this year- keep in mind that this is a funding accessory to the event and isn't necessary to the event happening successfully.
	•	SGC Member (con?): I won't stand up and will speak quietly so the Parliamentarian can't hear what I'm saying.
	•	Relay for Life 1 (pro): Don't see how this could be seen as unnecessary.
	•	Hannah (question): Any information on why this isn't being funded now?
	•	Lauren M: It's a new item for the event and we've had more groups request this year, so we needed to cut back wherever we could.
	•	Connor (pro): A lot of what we do with funding is based on precedent- if they received this money in the past, they should get it now- they outlined a lot of different reasons why this is essential, I urge you to support this.
	•	Rebecca (pro): They shouldn't be punished for coming up with a better idea.
	•	Ian (con): SGC is justified in funding a little bit less since this is so new- they're both fun add-ons and it makes sense for them to fund a little bit less.
	•	Lauren (con): We had to make cuts where cuts could be made- I'm glad you're switching to a photo booth, you still would've been cut if you got the bounce house. We really needed to cut.
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote.
	•	Vote- fails. Additional funding is not approved.

	•	Relay for Life 1: Motion to reconsider.

	•	Relay for Life 1: Motion to amend line item for photo booth to $75
	•	Senator: Asked and answered?
	•	Ani: Different enough to warrant allowing this.
	•	Relay for Life 2: We get most of our funding from canning- we don't ask for much- we wanted to reduce some our other line items to get more funding for this.
	•	Ani: SGC Opinion?
	•	Lauren M: Same exact reasoning- I've been here since Winter 2010. This happened previously, they requested a lower and lower amount until they got it. We talked a lot about the photo booth.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Jane: Have you asked anyone besides ACS and ASG about this?
	•	Relay: Only groups we ask from, no one else will fund.
	•	Ian: How much were you funded last time they were funded?
	•	Lauren M: $720. All groups are expected to fundraise- we only funded a lot of the events partially and encourage groups to get creative based on their purpose.
	•	Jane: Current fee for relay and have you thought about raising it?
	•	Relay for Life 1: $10 and American Cancer Society sets that. This is funding that we deserve, I don't see what the problem is.
	•	Lauren M: ASG funding is only supposed to go to Northwestern students. A lot of the SAF funds should stay here and go to students and not the American Cancer Society. 
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con.
	•	Paul (con): If 47 groups applied, as opposed to 30, I'm sure groups got cut across the board- would be unfair to fund any group additional funds with this in mind. It's a great cause.
	•	Rebecca (pro): Important to note that these girls are here because they're here sitting through all this- while we usually do adhere to SGC opinion, if we think this is fun or useful, we, as Senate, can let them have fun.
	•	Alexander (con): This isn't just free money that exists in a vacuum, this is student money we have to take seriously. I think the committee's recommendations are fair. This is the students money that we have to prudently allocate.
	•	Mike (question): What happens to funding not used
	•	Ani: We've been over this- it goes into next funding cycle.
	•	Senator (pro): They've taken a major cut, fair to fund them this.
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote.
	•	Vote-
	•	Ay- 11
	•	Nay- 22
	•	Abstentions- 1
	•	Motion fails. Additional funding is not approved.
	•	Senator: Motion to suspend the rules and close funding.
	•	Vote- passed. Funding is closed.
	•	General Order: Cab Corner Launch
	•	David: Been talking with services about way to make things more effective and one of the ways we've done this is making Cab Corner
	•	Alex: Wanted to make this app to give students an easy way to connect with other students for organizing cabs shares, just want to introduce app and show how it works.
	•	David: Questions?
	•	Alexander: How to stop people from ditching rides?
	•	Alex: Valid concern- if someone decided to duck out, we're not sure what we'd do in that situation, maybe put a flag on their account.
	•	Morgan: Limit on how many people can join a ride?
	•	Alex: I think it's two people currently, might be future development to allow larger rides.
	•	Abby: Is this tied to a certain cab company?
	•	Alex: We have a database with fare information- not attributed to just one.
	•	Mark: Great service- as AVP for Sustainability, I need to speak up. This isn't more sustainable, you should strike all language about this being sustainable for our institution.
	•	David: I spoke with you about this and we contracted this site from someone else, so we can strongly request they change this, but not demand. Will work to do so.
	•	Paul: I know this is done through an outside company- can you include options for non-gender/transgender individuals?
	•	Alex: Thought this would be easily fixable- working on getting them to change this.
	•	Ian: Can we tie this in with a NetID?
	•	David: Would have to give CabCorner access to NetID and passwords…
	•	Ian: Say no more.
	•	David: We have pretty fliers for you to post up, please bring them back to your dorms- we'll be back to encourage additional PR closer to spring break. Thanks for hearing us out!
	•	Old Business: SR1213-10: Administration Transparency
	•	Harrison: Similar to the bill you saw last week- changed language to create a stronger bill more favorable to the student body.
	•	Harrison: Motion to amend- change in title, striking second be it resolved clause, changing language in first be it resolved.
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. Amendments are now included in the bill.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Alexander (con): This places unfair responsibility on administration, who've already stated that they cannot release additional information about this matter.
	•	Matthew Renick (pro): I'm the head of Chabad's student executive board- Harrison made a great point in saying this bill is focused on transparency. Transparency is good for moving forward, good for showing the administration that in the future, administration should be transparent.
	•	Brad (con): I appreciate you all writing this, but this is a non-starter and will only serve to antagonize administrators. Won't enact any change- will only serve to jeopardize our working relations with administration and won't be worth it. We've been in meetings where they've told us if you pass this nothing will happen. If we change the language of the bill to focus on Administration transparency, then maybe it can be more productive
	•	Ian (pro): Saying this will jeopardize our relationship with the administration is a bit much. Though not everyone may not have gotten to know Rabbi Klein, he is a powerful individual. We can ask for more information and should pursue that information ourselves. Not futile for voicing our opinion on this.
	•	Jesse (con): We all know that the university can't comment on this- if we ask them to comment on things preemptively is a little unfair- we should trust our administrators to give us information.
	•	Natalie (con): The university isn't trying to subdue information, it's a legal case that the university can't speak on. You're welcome to find information yourself, but passing this won't change anything.
	•	Senator: Motion to extend debate period by 5 minutes.
	•	Vote- passed. Debate period is extended by 5 minutes.
	•	Ani: Moving into more pro/con.
	•	Meredith (pro): I know a lot of you aren't Jewish and Chabad doesn't have a role in your  lives. Wrote a speech but won't have time to read it so I'll summarize. He was a first responder, has comforted students on campus during tough times. He is a selfless man and can help a lot of people on this campus, the transparency will help everyone see what a great community leader he is
	•	Victor (con): I don't like that this is becoming a discussion about the person in question. This is about the legal case- Chabad is great, Rabbi Klein is a good guy, but good people can still do wrong. We've done what we've can in promoting transparency- this resolution is asking us to go to PTI with the same question and would get us the same answer. This isn't the most productive approach. We can possibly have PTI come into talk, but I don't know if she'll have a lot to say. We've already explored this route.
	•	Evan (pro): This legislation represents what ASG is meant for- we're not going to get much more information from this resolution- it's about the right to ask for information. Our purpose as ASG is to give students a voice.
	•	Senator: Motion to extend debate period by 5 minutes.
	•	Vote- passed. Debate period is extended by 5 minutes.
	•	Ani: Moving into more pro/con.
	•	Alexander (con): The questions have already been asked and answered- there's not more that we can reasonably, practically do. No use in trying to squeeze blood from a stone
	•	Brad (con): That is what ASG is for- we met with PTI immediately after this happened in fall quarter. We've discussed this with Senators between then and now- getting the same answers isn't a productive use of our time. We are open to meeting with your executive board and finding these documents, but we can't go back to the administration for answers.
	•	Nick (pro):  Want to echo what Evan stated- you all are voices of the student body and this is very important to us. We want this as a precedent to move forward and know that ASG supports transparency for student groups on campus. Our group and Rabbi Klein are stunned by the administration's actions after 18 years on campus. To his knowledge, everything that he did was correct and protected- please just pass this bill to support him, if nothing else.
	•	Carly (con): Want to make sure everyone is aware that when issues arise, we meet them and exceed them. With mental health and other issues we've been doing our job and meeting with administrators- I don't think we need to write legislation to state what we're already doing.
	•	Ani: In line for a vote on the bill itself.
	•	Vote- division
	•	Ay: 16
	•	Nay: 11
	•	Abstentions: 6
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is approved.
	•	New Business: SL1213-25: Expanding the Library Charger Program
	•	Ian: I told you this was coming, talked with Mudd and Main Library, decided to send 7 chargers to Main, 3 to Mudd. Demonstrated interest in expanding into PC chargers, seems to work well based on reviews. Recommending 4 be bought to be sent up to Mudd, 2 to be sent up to main, since engineers tend to be up north and use PCs for their work.
	•	Ani: Any questions?
	•	Abby: Buying these through amazon?
	•	Ian: Yes
	•	David H: Motion to move this to old business
	•	Vote-passed. Legislation is now old business.
	•	Ian: I am interested to hear if people think we should buy more at a lower price now or less.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Alexander: Will this lead to ASG buying large quantities of things up whenever there's a sale?
	•	Ian: There is a potential for a slippery slope, but only 4 chargers.
	•	Mark: Motion to previous question
	•	Alex: Objection
	•	Alex: Would like to amend so that the bill states that $240 be granted to library committee to be spent at their discretion- think there are prudent people on the committee
	•	Mark: Objection.
	•	Ani: Questions on the amendment?
	•	Dana: Is this committee even still continuing after this?
	•	Ian: I did most of the work for this committee, I am happy to do more work on this, but am more than happy to let this die tonight.
	•	Jane: Confused, are you asking for more money for more chargers?
	•	Alex: Yeah.
	•	Mike: What would be the structure for deciding this?
	•	Ani: Committee would vote on it
	•	Mark: Motion to previous question on the amendment
	•	Vote- passed. Amendment is included in the bill.
	•	Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is approved.
	•	New Business: SR1213-11: Acknowledging Our History
	•	Ian: University just created committee to look into John Evan's participation in the sand creek massacre. Specifically will look into policy toward Native American people of Colorado and whether or not the railroad he was building financed the university. Brown Unversity had a similar issue. Want to say that we support the efforts of the committee and want to involve NAISA and model this process similarly to what Brown did.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Alexander: What ways do you have in mind to encourage this dialogue?
	•	Ian: Based on Brown, they created a department to create academia focused on this issue going forward.
	•	Mark: Using both a Rawlsian and Nozickian framework, can you discuss this in terms of aspects of social and political philosophy.
	•	Ian: While we weren't the ones who committed these acts, there is knowledge in the world that John Evans was a part of this and Northwestern does nothing to acknowledge this. Don't want our diploma tied up in this.
	•	Good of the Order & Announcements
	•	Ian: Campaign reform is coming back next week with a bill; be ready for that.
	•	Brad: Please take a couple fliers and post them up!
	•	A&O Girl: this weekend is Oscar weekend, A&O is showing a lot of movies
	•	David: 7pm on Monday, the student advisory athlete committee is putting on a talent show, see them do cool stuff!
