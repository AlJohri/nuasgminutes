	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	John C: Can substitutes come?
	•	Brandon: Nope

	•	General Order: Code Review
	•	Brandon: Mostly basic grammatical/formatting changes, but there were a lot of them. Changed to also reflect all the legislation that amends the code. Any questions?
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote on passing code review.
	•	Vote, approved unanimously

	•	General Order: Introduction to FUNding
	•	Ani: Computers are a privilege- pay attention! Take it away Girish.
	•	Girish: funding kicked off last night- want to give a quick explanation of the process.
	•	Everyone pays $54 a quarter into the ASG Activities fee- 97% apply for A-status funds, the rest is for B-status groups
	•	A-status groups fill out an application that lists past programming, request for the year and tiers.
	•	Tiers- different levels of funding that groups want to be funded at.
	•	There are applications, then interviews, then recommendations are made, and these recommendations are approved by Senate. You should talk to your constituents about the funding recommendations once they're released
	•	You can propose changes to recommendations through add & cut rounds. Can use the Senate Amendment pool ($13,171) to add funds, but remember that if the money is not used, the money will be added onto the next cycle- don't feel pressured to spend all of it.
	•	SAFC is bound by tiers groups give
	•	If event has not happened, will not fund until SAFC can review it
	•	Capital improvements not vital to programming funded in supplemental funding cycle
	•	SAFC does not fund new events or food.
	•	Questions?
	•	Girish: Mock Funding Session with Lauren!
	•	We're going to start with an Add round, where you'd be able to motion to add funds-
	•	ADD ROUND
	•	Lauren: motion to add funds to the T Swift dance party- want to fund it at a 30% increase, which is some amount that is reflective of a 30% increase… it's currently at 6%
	•	Lauren: we all love T Swift- great, wholesome music, and I know people feel the same way. There were 5, kidding, 100, no 150 people who came to our last event, and attendance this time will blow my mind- because there will be so many people who want to dance.
	•	SAFC Opinion (Tori): The T Swift Dance Party didn't... [moustache issues] while we realize attendance increased, the pool increased by 4% and we already gave a 6% increase and need to fund other groups, so can't fund that much.
	•	Ani: Any questions?
	•	Girish: We have to be conservative based on the size of the pool
	•	Ani: Other motions?
	•	Lauren: More money for our winter speaker- what happened last year is we brought people to campus to analyze T Swift's lyrics. It was successful, so we want it funded in full and we were close to discovering T Swift's last boyfriend she's never ever everrr getting back together with
	•	Ani: want to add anything else?
	•	Lauren: No. We think the last boyfriend was John Mayer. SAFC should come to the event and we did it without their money, so it'll be awesome.
	•	Tori: we typically don't fund new events, but we funded publicity and other event costs because we want to see the event happen consistently and maybe give funds in the future
	•	Girish: didn't show consistent funding
	•	Ani: Questions? Motions to add?
	•	Lauren: want to fund exec trip to concert in full
	•	Lauren: want to bring exec, emailed T Swift telling her we'd be coming, will be expecting us- very important for our group. Might get stuff from the concert and it'll help us put on awesome programming later
	•	Tori: we fund programming, not groups- we want all of the programs we fund to be open to all students. This event is not open.
	•	Girish: don't look at what a student group needs, just what they program. It's to benefit all the student swho put money into the pool
	•	Lauren: groups that are ASG recognized and accept funding for an event need to make sure the event is open to all of campus.
	•	Question: how does that work with equipment?
	•	Girish: happens in the supplementary funding cycle- capital improvements are covered then unless it's vital to programming happening before then.
	•	Girish: You have a right to change any of this if you don't agree with it
	•	Lauren: A lot of people are confused about funding, you need to be the voice to explain to constituents how funding works.
	•	Girish: recommendations will be out next Wednesday- look out for it.

	•	General Order: Director of Campus Safety Confirmation
	•	Alex: Been talking about things Student Life can do to increase legitimacy- looked at the code and figured out that Student Life can appoint executive officers. Want to appoint Jane Gilmore for director of Campus Safety because she led the light-walk which was very successful and something that she'll be working on in the future. The title will give her a little bit of extra push & authority
	•	Ani: Exec members can with 2/3 of senate vote appoint executive officers- can give larger sense of legitimacy.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Noah: New subcommittee out of this?
	•	Alex: No- just gives Jane a title with more authority
	•	Ani: If no further questions, we'll move into a confirmation speech
	•	Jane: I'm a junior in Weinberg on student groups caucus and on student life- should be finished with light-walk reports next week and will be working on blue-light changes- been working with administration on other safety issues
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian: How long do you see this position lasting?
	•	Alex: As long as Jane's on the committee
	•	Mark: Describe relationship with PTI
	•	Jane: Loves PTI… can't pronounce her name… she's awesome
	•	Ian: Do you see this being a position that Student Life should fill year after year
	•	Alex: Should be appointed on a case by case basis- something to keep in consideration, but may not be required every year.
	•	Ani: Any endorsements?
	•	Motion to previous question,  second, passed
	•	Vote on approving Jane
	•	Approved- unanimous vote

	•	General Order: Working Group on Alcohol Policy & Culture Recommendations
	•	Ani: look for link to this on your agenda, group was tasked with looking at alcohol policy and culture and is now due to report back to Senate about research progress.
	•	Alex Van Atta: Yeah, we formed this in the spring to research and analyze NU's alcohol policy as compared to other peer institutions with the goal of making a comprehensive evaluation of NU's alcohol policy.
	•	First met June 24th, decided on what universities to research based on administrative recommendations
	•	Met in September to get on same page and had more individual meetings leading up to deadline.
	•	Selected a list of schools to research between other COFHE schools and interesting cases like University of Indiana, U of C, Wash U
	•	Northwestern's Alcohol Policy
	•	Known as "Call, Stay, Cooperate"
	•	Call 911
	•	Stay with person
	•	Cooperate with emergency officials
	•	Incident will be documented
	•	“…This means that no formal University disciplinary actions or sanctions will be imposed for alcohol or drug infractions…”
	•	“…the incident will be documented, and educational, community, and health interventions – as well as contact with a student’s parents or family – may be required as a condition of deferring disciplinary actions or sanctions…”
	•	From data, many viewed alcohol as social lubricant and something to do- steps have been taken to give students more late night options
	•	Before coming to NU, only about 40% of students have had alcohol, after the first few months of freshman year, number increases to mid 70%
	•	Monika: Stanford implemented new alcohol policy highlighting high rish drinking as area of concern, provost spoke with parents about alcohol and targetted alcohol education and discouraged hard liquor consumption
	•	Alex Matelski: U of C has on campus pub, requires educational online course.
	•	Hampton: No alcohol at all, even if 21+
	•	Nothing notable.
	•	Wash U: "Students should be treated as responsible adults until proven otherwise" Very tolerant
	•	Indiana: Hoosier PACT- specifies medial amnesty for individual, caller and organizations- fosters community-wide "culture of care," that encourages calling over anything else.
	•	Notre Dame: Recent policy of prohibiting alcoholic beverages >14%. Resulted in fewer alcoholic containers found
	•	Ian: (Question) Research states that hard alcohol is worse than things like beer- did you do any research on this?
	•	Administration wouldn't give data and stated beer could be just as bad at harming students. We're under this assumption, the administration is not.
	•	Elder CA stated that all incidents of alcohol hospitalization was from hard alcohol
	•	University of Florida: Fine with non-hard alcohol, and it's PTI's old school
	•	Dartmouth: "Students seeking assistance will not be subject to disciplinary action after taking an educational course on alcohol."
	•	Alex Van Atta: Looking at some of the schools, saw schools implement student run system of third-party risk management. Would look for reckless behavior. They're trained and incredibly effective. Haverford showed that alcohol hospitalizations went to zero- can be paid by school and only requirements are four hour course and sobriety on the job. At Dartmouth, students get paid $44 a night for this, and this program has also been effective.
	•	Alex Van Atta: Inhibitions to Research
	•	Lack of willingness to release data about alcohol consumption
	•	Absence of communication or cooperation from administration stakeholders
	•	Lack of data from administration made our research much more difficult
	•	Administration appears to value their image over the safety of their students
	•	Alex Matelski: University should change campus drinking culture and make more realistic picture of campus drinking with an educational system to prepare students to make wise decisions. University should lend implicit trust to student to make wise decisions, emphasizing responsibility over punishments
	•	Monika: Other recommendations
	•	Northwestern University should institute a student-led organization for the indirect policing of campus parties via risk management. These groups should be university trained but only internally accountable, so as to develop trust between the organization, students, and organizations hosting parties.
	•	Northwestern University should provide for an anonymous exit survey following a hospitalization in order to gather more reliable data on demographics as well as geographic circumstances of dangerous behavior.
	•	Northwestern University should mandate Red Watch Band training for all student leaders so that no confusion or hesitation exist in the event of an emergency.
	•	Alex Matelski: University should monitor distribution of distilled liquors. Should also implement amnesty for students and organizations
	•	Ian: (Question) Can you formally back up the suggestion to limit distilled liquors with evidence and numbers
	•	Anonymous exit surveys provide that data and would ask what they've been drinking
	•	Alex: There's data from administrators that we can use, but not share
	•	Girish: (Question) how would the administration monitor limiting distilled liquors?
	•	Alex M: University has a lot of sway over local businesses and limiting such things.
	•	Alex Van Atta: Next steps
	•	Alcohol survey written and distributed campus-wide by end of Fall quarter
	•	Focusing on students’ knowledge of alcohol policy
	•	See if the current policy has caused hesitation when calling for help, or even stopped them from calling
	•	Analyze over Winter Break
	•	Go over recommendations with relevant parties (IFC, PHA, MGC, NPHC, RCB, RHA), get approval/amendments from exec boards, then proposed/voted on by ASG Senate
	•	Present to administration Winter Quarter
	•	We have good data from other schools, but we need to get more groups on board to get more push.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	John C:These recommendations to meet with other groups, when will this happen?
	•	Alex Van Atta: After we have data from our survey and have a more complete argument using our data and recommendations
	•	Mark: is the university doing anything formally for this?
	•	Monika: Dartmouth initiative: meets every 6 months to look at other schools for solutions to underage drinking incidents
	•	Alex Van Atta: Some consortium of schools in our tier has been meeting to compile a report in 2013.
	•	Michelle: Why isn't the Quaker Bouncer being recommended
	•	Alex Matelski: We did, still want to work out logistics
	•	Corrine: What is end goal for Notre Dame's policy?
	•	Alex Van Atta: It's an attempt to change campus culture
	•	Paul: If we instituted a Quaker Bouncer Program, where would we get funding from?
	•	Alex Matelski: Our recommendation is that it starts as a student group, not university funded work-study. Would move to that in the future
	•	Alex: These are just preliminary recommendations, will provide more info as details become available
	•	Sean: In terms of the relationship between the student group and the people throwing parties, how would this group be informed of parties happening?
	•	Alex Van Atta: Student groups would ideally come to them to have another sober individual watching over things.
	•	Alex Matelski: Would hopefully increase accountability
	•	Corrine: Why didn't they give it to you?
	•	Alex: Administration member said she couldn't give a copy of the data, didn't want data to get published.
	•	Monika: Tried higher-ups to get data, but got no response
	•	David H: How will you get this data? Through CAs? All campus email
	•	Alex: Still in preliminary stages of planning that aspect. Want to use initial survey to see if students know policy. Exit survey would be done through university, ideally.
	•	Monika: University doesn't have demographic info on drinking incidents at the moment
	•	Girish: Is there a way for other Senators to get involved with this process.
	•	Alex Van Atta: Yeah, seen lots of interest for this, we've had two people drop out so we could use more spots
	•	Brad: the seats are RCB and RHA's, as things are written, the open seats are designated to those respective bodies. Maybe edit legislation to change group constitution
	•	Ani: now is the time to redefine the membership of things like this.
	•	Ani: Other questions.
	•	Ani: Alright, they'll continue work and we'll take a candy break!

	•	General Order: Shuttle Working Group & Dorm Conditions Selection
	•	Ani: Lot has been spoken to you, now we'll elect people to two working groups which have since diminished. Focusing on Shuttle and Dorm Conditions Working Groups
	•	Transportation Working Group
	•	Ani: Katie, Victor- can you give some background about the working group?
	•	Katie: Victor and I worked on transportation working group which focused on shuttles and pointed out problems with shuttles to administration. There are lots of hidden restrictions with changing the schedule, and that was the roadblock we hit. We definitely need more people. The work would probably entail sending out a survey to students about shuttles and using those results to make a recommendation/proposal to the administration. Wouldn't be huge time commitment, but would be some work
	•	Victor: Saferide?
	•	Katie: Worked with a class to see ways SafeRide can be improved. I only have a limited knowledge about it, but it's something we can definitely work on
	•	Victor: lots of room for improvement with SafeRide's infrastructure- maybe look into vendors for different technology for SafeRide management?
	•	Katie: It'd be ideal if we could have 1-2 people to focus on SafeRide and 1-2 on shuttles
	•	Ani: 2 spots, great for a deep dive into an issue and start proposing solutions to that problem. Any questions about this working group?
	•	Ani: Alright, nominations?
	•	Ian Coley: I nominate Ian Hendrickson
	•	Ian Hendrickson: I accept
	•	Ian Coley: I nominate Mike Morgan
	•	Mike: I accept
	•	Ani: The nomination period is now closed. Ian, Mike- please give introductory speeches about why you want to join this working group.
	•	Mike: Really interested in getting voice heard on this issue and improving shuttles/saferide for students
	•	Ian: Really using SafeRide more often now that I'm off-campus and can see that things need to be changed. Not sure of what I can change right now, but will be able to talk with people who have thoughts on the subject
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Noah: What are the problems you have w/ SafeRide
	•	Ian: Every organization can be better- want to work on the operational side of it.
	•	Mike: Definitely ways to improve wait times and make the service more accessible. Also want to review when SafeRide operators tell people to take shuttles, and that's not always and option.
	•	Mark: Ways to reduce fuel consumption per capita of SafeRide cars?
	•	Mike: ways to reduce fuel consumption? Might be beyond the scope of our committee...wouldn't know how to make it better.
	•	Ian: when the working group got to that point, we'd talk to you for input.
	•	Ani: Other Questions?
	•	Ian: Motion to white ballot?
	•	Second
	•	Objections?
	•	Ani: White ballot instantly moves candidates into spots
	•	Vote, passed unanimously
	•	Dorm Conditions Working Group
	•	Ani: Fizzled out after completing work last year, have heard from Senators they'd like to work on it, 3 spots open and an opportunity to work on tangible issues
	•	Brad: Difference from the work RHA/RCB does
	•	Ani: Dorm Conditions Working Group meant to centralize and formalize solutions to these problems outside of the traditional means of trying to solve these problems- would be tasked with evaluating ways to call attention to facilities problems. Would work in conjunction with Student Life and RHA/RCB Senators
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Harrison: Time commitment?
	•	Ani: Working groups are traditionally self-governing- responsible to report to me and Alex and Senate, but working groups try to split the work equally and self-govern. Great for taking ownership of projects, time commitment is what you make of it.
	•	Ani: Any other questions? Nominations?
	•	Lauren: Nominate Morgan Hunt
	•	Morgan: I accept
	•	Lauren: Nominate Harrison Flagler
	•	Harrison: I accept
	•	Chris Harlow: I nominate myself
	•	Chris: I accept
	•	Ani: Nomination period is now closed- please come up and speak about why you want to be on this working group
	•	Morgan: Lived in Sargent before, now live in Kemper, there are a multitude of problems to address
	•	Chris: Freshman in SESP in LOC & Econ, in community relations committee- wanted to work with Evanston City Government, but living in Elder and wants to use opportunity to address problems in on-campus life to better prepare for off-campus work
	•	Harrison: Live in NMQ- showers are cold, there are centipedes, as a freshman, I can see issues in my own dorm and others
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian: How will you make sure you're looking at all dorms on campus when evaluating?
	•	Morgan: Send out survey to residents
	•	Chris: Creep through all the dorms
	•	Harrison: They already stated the best methods, maybe as a group, survey all the dorms on campus and decide what needs to be improved
	•	Alex Lower: NU probably won't want to renovate every dorm on campus, what are low-budget solutions to focus on?
	•	Chris: Student happiness, shower conditions and curtains/doors, putting in water fountains (for the long term). Wants to focus on small things that can make an impact. Smoking receptacles…
	•	Harrison: Dorms like Elder won't need a huge amount of money for renovations- need to get all the dorms up to the same base-line, like getting air conditioning for all dorms- then can work on stuff like showers to get all of the dorms to a point where none of them can be considered bad.
	•	Morgan: my first priority would be bugs because they're gross, then things that are manageable, like shower curtains
	•	Mark: Personal experience with housing, facilities management?
	•	Harrison: Bizarre problem that only my room lost power- communicated heavily with facilities. Was part of a high school that was over
	•	Morgan: Has worked with these departments in the past
	•	Chris: Worked with online request system for work orders, reserved a room… not much else other than that
	•	Ian: How to make sure capital improvements will be done in a sustainable way?
	•	Morgan: work with sustainability and Mark Silberg
	•	Chris: Work with companies in Chicago and stuff like light bulbs
	•	Harrison: Would consult sustainability
	•	Ian: How to work with RHA/RCB?
	•	Chris: Would talk to that one marketing guy in RCB… would contact RHA. Lot of places to cover and lots of sources for information.
	•	Harrison: Will be the person to meet with RHA to convey information for caucus and will use that consult with RHA about these issues.
	•	Morgan: Will communicate through Harrison and be sure to remain in contact otherwise
	•	Alex Lower: Will this cover things prohibited in dorms like microwaves, Christmas lights?
	•	Ani: That's Illinois Code… but they can look into it
	•	Jane: Motion to close question period
	•	Accepted
	•	Ian: Motion to white ballot
	•	Accepted, passed unanimously, new members approved

	•	Old Business: SL1213-08: Service and Community Engagement Grant
	•	Chris Harlow: I'm Brad for Halloween
	•	Ani: 2 minutes to go over legislation
	•	Chris: Want to pull $500 from project pool, by the first of March, selection committee will present three choices to fund to Senate and then fund groups accordingly. NUnite has a grant for collaboration, but it's very different from what we want to do
	•	Steven: Money for collaboration
	•	Mike: Goals of the two opportunities are totally different- our bill wants to encourage groups to do programming off campus for betterment of community
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Rebecca: Long timeline, reasoning for dates?
	•	Chris: No reasoning at all
	•	Mike: Nooo, we want to give the working group time to build up and get prepared for this, want to give people a chance to work on this over Winter Break.
	•	Steven: do you have any other suggestions for the timeline…?
	•	Ani: Not in line
	•	Jane: Motion to close question period
	•	Ian: Motion to amend, change from Reading Week to penultimate Senate
	•	Previous question on the amendment
	•	Passed unanimously
	•	Jane: (Question) How much in Project Pool after this
	•	David C: Around $7,000
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question
	•	Ani: moving to a vote on the bill, ending debate
	•	Vote, legislation passed unanimously

	•	Old Business: SR1213-02: Northwestern Climate Commitment
	•	Mark: This resolution confirms our commitment to a greenhouse gas review, it's all in the legislation. Questions?
	•	Ian: Motion to amend… rescinded, change was already made
	•	Ani: Pro/Con?
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote, passed unanimously
	•	Ani: Great, we'll send this to Morty

	•	New Business: SL1213-09: NU Day at the United Center
	•	Brad: Yay, I get to talk. As talked about last week, this got brought up at the beginning of last year, but the lockout killed this. CSI wants to revive project and wants money from ASG. Asking to help cover $20,000 cost, some of this will be covered by students buying tickets- people will be able to sit in a student section at the United Center, this funding would also cover travel.
	•	Brad: One of the concerns was if this event would happen without our funding, without our funding would be able to purchase fewer tickets and would diminish the event's impact. Would get great publicity and would really connect students
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Motoki: Can we amend to possibly change the date?
	•	Brad: it's up to the Bulls
	•	Motoki: Like if one date was cheaper?
	•	Brad: You can amend, but CSI needs to know they can get the money before selecting the date
	•	Noah: where's the rest of the $20,000 coming from? And we cover 5%, why would our non-commitment reduce attendance?
	•	Brad: Lots of other things that go into the $20,000, other organizations like RHA are submitting much more, can't speak to exact seat decrease, but that was the example I've given
	•	Ian: Can you come back with a line item budget and other contributors?
	•	Brad: Line-item budget doesn't exist, not determining budget until they know how much money they have. I can't dictate to them to come up with it, it's not our event.
	•	Mark: historical attendance numbers for NU Day at Wrigley?
	•	Brad: NU Day at Wrigley has higher attendance- 800-1000 or more and open to faculty, not just students. Since this is more expensive and the weather is worse, they expect that interest  would be lower, and the Bulls don't think we can fill more than 300 seats with no prior experience doing this.
	•	Rebecca: Could there still be a decrease in attendance even if we give this money?
	•	Brad: Potentially, yes.
	•	Alex Lower: If other groups end up giving more money, will we get less publicity?
	•	Brad: No
	•	Jane: How much left in the project pool after this?
	•	Brad: $6000
	•	Motoki: Once we pass this, is there any push you can make to change the date…?
	•	Brad: If you write it into the legislation, I'll convey that request
	•	Ani: Alright, will be old business next week.

	•	New Business: SL1213-10: In-Senate Voting Procedure
	•	Ian: This is really important- some previous votes through plurality have been unfair. Preferential voting is basically ranking the candidates, and removing loser to … … … … basically look on the website and in the legislation for how to do it.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Alex Lower:  Do you think it'll take longer to count?
	•	Ian: It will, but it's better for democracy and Senate's interests
	•	Rebecca: Who counts votes?
	•	Ani: Parliamentary Body
	•	Mark: Economic basis for this form of voting?
	•	Ani: Not going to allow that
	•	David Harris: How to disincentive strategic voting?
	•	Ian: Hopefully senators aren't trying to rig the system.
	•	Dana: Who takes minutes while votes are being counted
	•	Ani: The Senator pro tempore, or someone from Exec
	•	Ani: this will be old business next week

	•	New Business: SR1213-03: Helping Those Affected by Hurricane Sandy
	•	Victor: This resolution is in response to Hurricane Sandy and voicing support for the East Coast. It's a sign of support and encouragement to donate. Would send out email voicing support.
	•	Mark: Want to move to old business since this is time sensitive
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Mike: If this was passed, I know this says the student body supports this, but will there be follow-up to actually get the word out about our support?
	•	Victor: Haven't considered other donors to submit money, but can, and will send out email over ASG channels for wider distribution, it's something we'll talk to PTI about as well
	•	John C: Motion to move to old business
	•	Passed unanimously
	•	Motion to Previous question
	•	Ian: objection
	•	Ani: We'll move into pro/con on moving to previous question
	•	Ian (pro): I feel like there's a greater point of resolving legislation that needs to be discussed.
	•	Rebecca (con): We should go to a vote
	•	Mike (pro): Should still give opportunities for a pro/con
	•	Noah (con): Urgency of situation lends itself to passing it now, can think of other solutions in  the time ahead
	•	Mark (pro): Agree with Ian, if you have something to say, let's just go ahead with the legislation
	•	Ani: Seeing no other cons, moving to a vote of whether to move to vote on this immediately.
	•	Vote- Division
	•	21 in favor
	•	13 against
	•	1 abstention
	•	2/3 majority needed to move to previous question- motion to previous question fails
	•	Ani: Moving on to pro/con
	•	Mike (pro): I'm from New York, seeing the destruction is devastating, more needs to be stated to publicize this message. I'm very much in support of this legislation though. We need to put the action into it
	•	Ian (con): what we want here is more action on an issue- resolution doesn't necessitate positive action on anyone's part. Saying that we support people doing things isn’t effective. Need to change so that resolutions are meaningful- consider that we can write something more actionable.
	•	Rebecca (pro): Writing resolutions in support of things are what legislative bodies do. Action is necessary, but there's no reason not to pass this right now. It's a way of showing we care and shouldn't be stopped because there's no action behind it.
	•	Steven (pro): I would recommend adding something in to put real action behind this
	•	Ani: After passing a resolution, we show the resolution to other relevant parties and can broadcast this message under the terms of a resolution.
