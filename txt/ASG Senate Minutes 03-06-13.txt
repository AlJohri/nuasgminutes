ASG Senate Minutes
03-06-13

I. Executive Board Reports
	•	Brad: A couple things- Victor is stuck in DC unable to get a flight home because of the snow. 10K publicity will go out next week, with voting starting on Sunday until the following Sunday. We'll also be meeting with the new Dean of Students, Todd Adams. Also talking about restarting New Student Center Initiative to gauge student opinion about making a student fee for it.
	•	David: Three announcements- first, Cab Corner launched last week and works as an online service to facilitate taxicab sharing when students travel to the airport. Second thing- food truck festival confirmed with Spoon for first Thursday next quarter- they do great PR. I'll let Casey talk about the third thing
	•	Casey: I gave a presentation a few weeks back about BookSwap- should be launching tonight. Please post your books on the site. The more books that get posted, the larger the effect on the community.
	•	David: To emphasize, we really want you to post your books. This can be a powerful tool- it's most efficient if students are buying and selling from each other. You can post your books now, the site will be beautified tonight.
	•	Lauren: Tonight is my last Senate- we recognized three student groups: Project RISHI & Cirque de NU got T-status and Students for Justice in Palestine got B-status
	•	Girish: Also my last meeting, transitioning out
	•	Steven: Nothing new to report. Things are going as planned, registering people for Evanston voting.
	•	Brad: Remembered the last thing I was gonna say- Board of Trustees are in town- we'll be going to a meeting with them tomorrow and will report on what they discuss. Will talk about the New Student Center- hopefully something will come of that.
	•	Brandon: Nothing much new to report, just working on code, guideline and constitution review depending on what exactly is passed tonight.
	•	Ani: SGAC will be meeting next week to determine student group seats.
II. Special Order: Kelly Schaefer, Executive Director of Norris University Center
	•	Kelly: Came from IIT and before that DePaul. Want to be a partner for making things happen for students. Want to also talk about New Student Center- lots of concepts have developed, the student life BoT meeting tomorrow is a big hurdle coming up. Have been talking with SGC and members of the administration about various initiatives going forward
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Alex Lower: Can you give us an idea of what the new student center will look like?
	•	Kelly: Very conceptual, but from a campus plan, will be connected to campus in a really cool way. The architects are considering us as cutting edge in our ideas. We're trying to connect more with academics in terms of Norris, and want to bring the learning experience to Norris. We have some pretty big issues to contend with, including the loading dock.
	•	Brad: She can't point to a specific design because it's all very rough at this point.
	•	Lauren: Best way to get in touch with you?
	•	Kelly: My number is 773.329.7531- you can text or call me. I'm on the third floor of Norris next to the alumni room. My email is kelly.schafer@northwestern.edu, I don't like voicemail.
	•	Mike: When Norris is open 24-hours next week, will that be used as a test of 24-hour spaces?
	•	Kelly: That was the initial intention, but the week that we're holding it will be different from most weeks in that it'll have more programming and it'll be later in the quarter. We try to think about health concerns when deciding whether or not to keep Norris open 24/7- want to make sure we're encouraging spaces like these without encouraging bad study habits and staying up all night.
	•	Mike: Would you ever consider extending the service of the campus/Evanston loop to match Norris staying open 24/7?
	•	Kelly: SafeRide can't extend, haven't gotten a reply from shuttles. Not my department and it's a funding year, might have to look at the issue later for sweeping changes like that.
	•	Kyreese: Will student staff be required to work overnight during 24/7 hours?
	•	Kelly: No, we have a full time staff that will stay overnight and keep the center open.
	•	David: Some of my committee members talked to you about Norris mini courses- how do you see mini courses changing and will there be any changes in pricing to make it more accessible to students?
	•	Kelly: Student led seminars have come up- we'd want to make sure that student instructors are qualified. Also wouldn't want to pay them less than regular instructors. Want to also open these seminars up to students in lower SESs. Been talking about a lot of these things
	•	April: Can you talk about the construction of the new student center?
	•	Kelly: A lot more glass- more wide open spaces. Don't want to make it more than 4 floors so that it's more centralized. In the conceptual drawings we're looking at, there'll be a student organization porch/collaborative area. Student orgs have changed to work better in environments like this- would be mostly glass.
	•	Chris: When construction begins, how long will it take and how will it affect students?
	•	Kelly: Depends if we can get money all at once or not- could affect timeline. Also depends on campus master-plan and other buildings under construction. Would likely move to another building during construction.
	•	Ani: Thanks for coming in!
III. Special Order: Social Inequalities & Diversities Requirement Presentation & Discussion
	•	Sofia: This will have huge implications if passed and many students have questions about it, prompting this presentation. [Presentation Linked Above]
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	David: Why didn't we compare with COFHE schools?
	•	Hayley: We will wanted to compare with schools we've been comparing ourselves with lately.
	•	Alexander: I don't see religion as one of the positionalities looked at?
	•	Sofia: I brought this up as well, we're still working on this and it'll be included if it's determined to be a priority.
	•	Alex: Wouldn't picking a class time ensure people will be there?
	•	Sofia: This is outside of the class, it's like a discussion section.
	•	David: Is there any thought into making sure groups are deliberately diverse somehow?
	•	Jazzy: Yes- you can't just sign up with your friends, and moderators will be included in the groups.
	•	Motoki: You said this committee is formed by faculty, staff & students? What will be the backgrounds of these professors?
	•	Sofia: The actual make-up of the committee is quite diverse.
	•	Sarah: Will those managing these sessions be able to discuss more sensitive issues?
	•	Sofia: Yes, they will be trained to do so.
	•	Motoki: Do you know when the COFHE research will get done?
	•	Hayley: Soon! I want to stress that it's unusual that this proposal has been shared with students at all- this is unheard of as far as proposals go.
	•	Tori: Are you trying to create new classes or implement this curriculum into existing classes?
	•	Sofia: A little of both, depending on specific factors in each school.
[Breakout Sessions]
	•	Hayley: Ok, bringing it back… other questions?
	•	Alex: Currently, how would this class be graded?
	•	Hayley: That's yet to be determined, but there are a lot of cool options on the table- right now we're just trying to get it through faculty senate and get it approved. If any of the groups discussed any good ideas about that, let us know!
	•	Alexander: Shouldn't be the kind of grading where students lose sight of the purpose, yet shouldn't cause students to stress out.
	•	Henry: I think it should be heavily participation based.
	•	Mark: Have to disagree- not everyone's super comfortable speaking up in discussions.
	•	Alex: If you grade it entirely on participation, you could be very close minded and just be vocal.
	•	Sofia: A lot of professors grade participation a bit differently based on the quality of discussion as well, so hopefully that problem would be avoided.
	•	Jesse: If you enter the class close-minded, you should be able to do well- not ok to force someone to change their opinions.
	•	Jazzy: I get what you're saying- there's an assumption we're trying to change. We want people to bring their beliefs to the table and discuss them.
	•	Abby: Will there be any sort of personal assessment before and after the course?
	•	Hayley: That's another topic of conversation and will be something to consider down the road.
	•	Sarah: Was going to say something about participation and closed/open mindedness- there's a difference between being close minded and open- if you won't listen to anyone, that's different from having an opinion that's less popular.
	•	David: Have you worked to engage the people who show up to these meetings?
	•	Hayley: We've submitted this draft, gone to faculty members- we've been working to engage students we haven't heard from
	•	David: It's important to talk to students who aren't having these conversations. That's difficult, but if there's any way that we can seek these people in a sort of focus group environment, maybe through a fireside, it's really important.
	•	Mark: You're presupposing that majority opinion is relevant in a conversation about minority rights. Ian brought up a good point in our breakout group that I'm going to make him say again.
	•	Ian: We might learn about a new culture in a class, but we don't have anything that analyzes our current ability and status and how that affects our ability to function. We don't have that now and the curriculum component will provide that.
	•	Sofia: The requirement is very much about how students view their environment in the context of their experiences.
	•	Motoki: Are you going to say that students support this or encourage them to collect student support
	•	Hayley: We're working with the Provost, it's how we're getting the voice of students. They've reached out to us a lot about it. We're having a Q&A session tomorrow with administrators at 6pm in the Armadillo Room. If you want to make sure faculty hears you directly, come to that!
IV. General Order: Financial VP Confirmation
	•	Girish: As we touched upon earlier, me and Lauren are both done with our terms. We had a selection committee made up of several individuals- we ended up nominating Siddiq for the position.
	•	Siddiq: It's an honor to be nominated for this position. To give some background, I was one of those freshman who went to every event, started as an AE for the SAFC in my sophomore year- been advising groups for quite some time- it's basically helping to form campus culture. Being in the FVP position will allow me to work with these organizations in a better way. Want to upgrade our price index, digitize everything with Google Drive. Also want to get faculty and student advisors on the same page.
	•	Ani: Opening the floor for questions.
	•	Ian: What other major leadership positions will you have over the next year?
	•	Siddiq: Since the FVP is such a large commitment, I won't have any other big positions.
	•	April: Will you encourage your AEs to go to many of the events as possible?
	•	Siddiq: I love going to the events- you can learn a lot from them. I would like to urge AEs to go to as many events as they can, but they're only required to go to their own groups events that are funded through the SAF. There are so many events, it's sometimes just not possible to require them to go to more.
	•	Mark: In comparison to Girish, what are your strengths and weaknesses as relevant to your role as FVP?
	•	Siddiq: Girish was very good at starting new initiatives, I want to sustain that. As a con, Girish is very motivated and likes to take on responsibilities by himself- want to delegate more to the committee.
	•	Patrick: Favorite A&O show?
	•	Siddiq: I liked Lupe Fiasco.
	•	David: Major reforms to the funding system seem inevitable- what are some of the priorities going forward regarding how we allocate money through the SAF?
	•	Siddiq: The pool is growing substantially- we want to target co-sponsorships, and also want to look at how much groups have to give back to the SAF when the accept money.
	•	Sofia: Given your strengths and weaknesses, what added direction do you want to give to the position?
	•	Siddiq: A good move in the right direction is getting the advisors to be more of an asset to student organizations so that they can do their jobs well. We, as students, might not be here after 4 years, but faculty advisors will.
	•	Mark: How will you work with the sustainability committee to make student group events more sustainable?
	•	Siddiq: Many student groups have done small things on their own to move toward more sustainable methods, but would definitely be interested in talking about more organized efforts with the sustainability community.
	•	Sarah: What do you think that you would bring to the exec board?
	•	Siddiq: I will be hearing about a lot of student group issues- I stand as a representative of student group concerns and issues
	•	Ani: Moving into a debate/endorsement period.
	•	X: Something abundantly clear from his answers is how much he cares about student groups, which is the most important thing someone in this position can have
	•	X: I endorse this candidate since he actually likes going to student group events, I also like how he wants to work with advisors.
	•	X: I really got to see Siddiq grow- he is probably one of the best people to look at both sides of the argument. I don't need to talk about how dedicated he is to going to student group events. He truly cares about every group he works with.
	•	X: Siddiq has been my account executive since the fall. I've dealt with several AEs in my time here- most want to make sure your group is doing well- Siddiq is different in that he wants to bring a critical element to programming and discussing ways to make student group events better.
	•	Alexander: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Siddiq is confirmed as the next Financial Vice President.
	•	Girish: Thanks for a great year- people care about what ASG does, administrators certainly do, even if students don't seem to. Thanks again everyone!
V. General Order: Student Groups VP Confirmation
	•	Lauren: Like Girish said, we met this past weekend with a selection committee to select my successor- want to nominate Neel Lalkiya.
	•	Neel: I'm a junior chemistry major- I joined the SGC in April of last year and worked with a wide variety of groups. That gave me a wide variety of experiences dealing with different kinds of groups. The SGC should improve on meeting with groups- it's important for the GEs to meet with groups. It's important for the SGVP especially to ensure groups learn about funding, training, SOFO, CSI, administration and other parties to ensure that events happen.
	•	Ani: Opening the floor for questions.
	•	David: As Kelly Schafer mentioned, a big priority for going forward is changing recognition processes- how do you see this changing over the next year under your leadership?
	•	Neel: A lot of groups don't need ASG recognition necessarily, but still think it's important for them to go through ASG for support. There're a lot of groups that have specific interests- the New Student Groups Committee will focus on helping any group on campus with resources. It's a good direction to go in so that we don't have to deal with 600 groups but need to make sure groups are still getting the resources they need.
	•	Mark: Same two questions as before.
	•	Neel: Sustainability- it's important that GEs enforce this and can work with your committee to ensure this happens. Comparing myself to Lauren- she did the same thing as Girish in taking everything on her back- Lauren improved the entire process. It's very important to subdivide responsibilities between GEs. Now that the framework is set up we need to refine it and divide responsibility.
	•	Ian: Can you describe your current relationship with the FVP and what you'll do with that relationship?
	•	Neel: I just met Siddiq, but will definitely work with him closely going forward. Important for GEs and AEs to work together. It'll be important for us to hold occasional joint meetings to enhance communication.
	•	Sarah: What do you think is the importance of Senate in your role?
	•	Neel: Senate and Senators are an important asset- need student feedback in the decisions we make and need to know what sorts of groups need what types of resources to succeed.
	•	Alex: There are more and more groups applying and requesting money, and the responsibilities of the SGC are also changing, how do you plan to address these changes?
	•	Neel: Our funding process is becoming more involved and I want to ensure GEs are becoming more involved as part of that. Need to implement GEs in that process to make sure groups aren't confused.
	•	Brandon: If selected, what do you see as your contribution to the executive board?
	•	Neel: Hope to be the expert of B and T status groups on campus and ensure that groups are collaborating on different areas on the executive board. It's a symbiotic relationship.
	•	Ani: Moving into a debate/endorsement period.
	•	X: I'm glad Neel applied to this position and I'm glad to be recommending him. This position has a steep learning curve and needs a quick learner. Neel is really strong in being social/approachable, he also needs to be comfortable in a leadership position. He cares very deeply about the student group community and I couldn't have asked for anyone better to apply.
	•	X: Agree with Lauren, he's great on the committee, always is very considerate and respectful
	•	X: Neel will do a great job with determining SGC empirical decisions.
	•	Mark: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Neel is confirmed as the next Student Groups Vice President.
	•	Brad: Thanks to Girish and Lauren- they've been invaluable to the organization. They've brought perspectives that have contributed a lot.
	•	Lauren: I've been through a lot of Senates, and you guys are probably my favorite. As a transfer student, I'm able to compare to a lot, and it's been awesome. Thanks for a great last couple of years.
VI. General Order: Election Commission Selection
	•	Ani: Now opening the floor for the Campus-Wide Election Commission. Seven spots to fill.
	•	Brad: I nominate Jason.
	•	Jason: I accept.
	•	Henry: I nominate Brandon.
	•	Brandon: I respectfully decline.
	•	Sarah: I nominate Abby.
	•	Abby: I accept.
	•	Brad: I nominate Petros.
	•	Petros: I accept.
	•	Abby: I nominate Dana.
	•	Dana: I accept.
	•	Brad: I nominate Alexander.
	•	Alexander: I accept.
	•	Paul: I nominate Henry.
	•	Henry: I respectfully decline.
	•	Tori: I nominate myself.
	•	Ian: I nominate Motoki.
	•	Motoki: I respectfully decline.
	•	Brad: I nominate Sarah.
	•	Sarah: I respectfully decline.
	•	Motoki: I nominate Brad.
	•	Brad: I respectfully decline.
	•	Abby: I nominate Alex Lower.
	•	Alex: I accept.
	•	Ani: Please come up and introduce yourselves.
	•	Jason: Did election commission last year, it was a lot of fun.
	•	Abby: Also served on election commission and was on the campaign reform ad-hoc. These are the people who will be leading us, campus needs to be aware of the candidates and the election commission is important to making that happen
	•	Petros: A good election is critical to a good ASG.
	•	Dana: Technically on the election commission right now through Rules. Want to be as involved as possible with making sure elections happen successfully.
	•	Alexander: Will be first election I've seen and would like to get involved, but great at learning on the job.
	•	Tori: Have worked on two elections, never want to do it again. Will be good to work from the other end.
	•	Alex: Want to make the elections exciting and engaging, but not obtrusive. Brad was annoying, not sure if that's good or bad democracy.
	•	Ani: Opening the floor for questions.
	•	Chris: How do you all feel about the campaign reform recommendations?
	•	Abby: I helped write them, like them, maybe biased.
	•	Petros: Like them- they even the playing field and makes the election fairer.
	•	Dana: Generally in favor but interested to see debate tonight on it.
	•	Alexander: Don't go far enough in leveling playing field, but good start. Getting rid of run-offs is a good idea.
	•	Tori: Lot of merit in the proposals, but interested to hear debate.
	•	Alex: Would like to look into the line about having Senators required to be at the debates, but in support.
	•	Jason: Only read them briefly, but generally approve.
	•	April: Since you're responsible for advertising, can you talk about what you would do to ensure people attend debates?
	•	Petros: Good to get people personally and talk to them about the election.
	•	Dana: I agree- more about making the debates a worthwhile experience rather than accosting them with PR.
	•	Alexander: Important to place at strategic locations and getting in people's faces
	•	Tori: Utilizing Senator connections is important to make a more personal message. Also important to sell the entire election.
	•	Alex: Getting student groups involved with the debates would be a good idea.
	•	Jason: Having a very active social media prescience would get a wider audience.
	•	Abby: Making personal connections and utilizing Senators is important- maybe taking clips of the debate could be utilized.
	•	Patrick: Have any of you met with or expressed support with anyone running and can you promise that you will remain impartial? Second part of question- will you take the hardline when dealing with election violations?
	•	Dana: Haven't met with anybody and don't plan on doing so. I'm completely comfortable with violations- they're there for a reason, every candidate goes into the same game, rules should all apply.
	•	Alexander: Met with Benison, not sure what he's running for… as far as violations are concerned, I'm a bit of a hard-ass, I'll only give people the same amount of chances as any other candidate.
	•	Tori: Been approached by several candidates and made it clear I'm not endorsing anyone. I take the hardline as a member of SAFC, so I have no problems being hard on violations.
	•	Alex: Got emailed by Benison, didn't respond, seemed sketchy. Very important to make sure candidates know about guidelines.
	•	Jason: Haven't met with candidates, take violations seriously.
	•	Abby: Met with someone considering running, didn't endorse them. It'll be the job of the commission to sit down with candidates and ensure they know what they're getting into.
	•	Petros: Met with candidates, endorsed no one. Answered questions, but not endorsed anything on platform, and obviously would not do that.
	•	Senator: Motion to white ballot.
	•	Vote- passed. Members are approved to the election commission.
VII. Old Business: SL1213-26: Campaign Reform Recommendations
	•	Ian: Hope you've all read this- two amendments made since last week are in red. First amendment: clarifying Code so that it's clear that the Rules Committee impeaches candidates. Second amendment: requires that exec attend debates as well as Senators.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Harrison: Concerns about preferential voting being confusing?
	•	Ian: We believe that preferential voting is superior because it eliminates runoffs. A good ballot design will mitigate confusions that might arise- Ethan can probably do this. Candidates will be ranked and it'll be clear when we put it onto the ballot itself.
	•	Henry: Would you be opposed to having the names come up in a random order? And no preference option?
	•	Ian: Yes to random order. For no preference- we could write the ballot to change rankings.
	•	Chris: How did you come up with the amount of resources to allocate?
	•	Ian: Had these specifications in the guidelines previously and used judgment in making other specifications.
	•	Tori: Given that there are pretty strict flyering and chalking zones, is there anything here to stop candidates from flyering and chalking outside these areas?
	•	Ian: It's already a rule under CSI regulations  that you can't do so.
	•	Henry: Logic behind increasing number of signatures?
	•	Ian: Looked at peer institutions- figured it wasn't unreasonable.
	•	Ian: Move to pass the amendments outlined in red.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Amendments are implemented into the bill.
	•	Brad: Motion to divide the question between before section 5 and after section 5.
	•	Brad: My reasoning is that this addresses two fundamentally different things, setting up the campaign and executing it. It's possible for one to pass and no the other and it would work because the two things are fundamentally different. When Steven brought this up the distinction was between determining the rules between before and after the election period.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con on dividing the question.
	•	Brad (con): This is a good piece of legislation overall. Everything above 5 is great- I have a number of problems with the execution of the campaign, both from ASG's perspective and my experience running as a candidate. Doesn't state where funding for materials comes from- 50 sticks of chalk isn't enough, chalk was meant to be more sustainable and need more- student group resource center doesn't work in the way the legislation suggests, would have to make a SOFO account for each candidate. Putting the monetary allocation at $150 doesn't account for inflation. Important to have a maximum number of signatures so campaigning isn't started earlier
	•	Alexander (question): how large will the chalk be?
	•	Abby: Big pieces.
	•	Mark (pro): These sound like a lot of good amendments- why did you not approach us in the last week?
	•	Ian (pro): An oversight not to cap signatures. Inflation is easily dealt with, changes in SAF for fees could change SAF drastically. We can up the chalk, but not in line with such a large increase,
	•	Ian: Motion to amend change signatures to be between 300 and 350.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Amendment is implemented in the bill.
	•	Ian: Motion to extend Senate by one hour.
	•	Vote- passed. Senate is extended.
	•	Mike: Motion to amend that Senators must be present in all debates- want to amend to half of the debates.
	•	Mike: Want to see this amended because, while I realize Senators should attend, many may be bogged down with midterms, but also want to see some teeth to make sure Senators definitely show up
	•	Katie: It's the responsibility of the Senator to be informed on the candidates and bring this information back to constituents.
	•	Tori (pro): Student group senators have other commitments, first two or three weeks are transition periods and making people choose between debates and their groups is unfair
	•	Alex: Motion to amend the amendment from at least half to at least 3 of the 4
	•	Alex: Withdrawn
	•	Dana (con): Important for us as part of the student government to be a part of these elections and be able to provide as good as answers to questions as possible. This is a good way to ensure everyone has that information.
	•	Morgan (pro): If we require that Senators be at every debate, it'll discourage others from coming.
	•	Paul (pro): In addition, forcing Senators to go to these debates makes it look like something that these aren't something Senators want to go to.
	•	Mark (con): Nobody's forcing them, you'll just get absences, and it's in your best interest.
	•	Abby (con): Wanted to point out that it's the job of the election commission to make sure these debates are publicized .
	•	Vote- division.
	•	Ay- 14
	•	Nay- 9
	•	Abstentions- 6
	•	Vote- passes. Amendment is implemented in the bill.
	•	Abby: Motion to amend- add executive board as required  to attend debates
	•	David: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. Amendment is implemented in the bill.
	•	Brad: Motion to amend- want to remove limitation on chalk.
	•	Brad: 50 sticks of chalk is too little- amendment would still provide cap on chalk, but more than 50. Provides more flexibility.
	•	Motoki (question): Ideal number of chalk sticks?
	•	Brad: Depends on individual campaign strategy
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con.
	•	Alexander (con): Already been over this, will need less chalk because chalking zones are now limited to flyering zones.
	•	Ian (pro): This seems reasonable- with the fact that chalking is now restricted to flyering zones, should be no problem with removing this restriction.
	•	Abby (pro): I agree.
	•	Mark: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- passed. Amendment is implemented in the bill.
	•	Mark: Motion to amend- want to add that Senators who fail to attend fewer than half of the debates shall be subject to immediate disciplinary review
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. Amendment is implemented in the bill.
	•	Brad: Motion to amend- motion to revert back to the original allocation of the ASG activities fee for that given year.
	•	Brad: for those of you that don't know the way the SAF works- it's called the Associated Student Government activities fee- asked a few years ago to increase with inflation and with the cost of living.
	•	Ian question: Do you think that changing the student activities fee in talks would affect this
	•	Brad: Won't change for at least a year, can determine if this happens
	•	Ani: moving into pro/con
	•	Ian (con): election commission can change to make sure it reflects inflation, helpful to change number for people looking at the guidelines who may not be familiar with the structure of the SAF..
	•	Alex: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- division.
	•	Ay: 11
	•	Nay: 9
	•	Abstentions: 7
	•	Vote- passes. Amendment is implemented in the bill.
	•	Mark: Motion to suspend the rules and move up both pieces of new business immediately.
	•	Vote- passed. Moving onto SR1213-13 and SL1213-27.
[Later]
	•	Brad: Motion to amend to strike the line that says an account in the student groups resources be credited with $24.
	•	Brad: Striking on the feasibility of the implementation- would need to open a SOFO account for a group to make this feasible.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Ian (con): It'd be easy to implement, ASG exec members have printer codes, shouldn't be working out logistics here
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- fails. Amendment is not implemented into the bill.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question on the legislation
	•	Ian: Just stated why this should go to a vote- other issues to address, the proper forum to address this was over the past week. This is a waste of time, this should be brought up to the election commission.
	•	Ani: pro/con
	•	Brad (con): Three remaining points, willing to set aside two about website templates and [something else]. Don't want to set aside how all of these campaign materials would be funded- nothing in the legislation clarifies this. Would have to fund things from Senate project pool this year, central operating budget next year.
	•	Ian (pro): Executive board is late on setting budget already, this money should come from the project pool for now.
	•	David: Motion to suspend the rules and state that the Senate project pool be used to fund this for the current election year
	•	Vote- passed. Amendment is implemented in the bill.
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is approved.
VIII. New Business: SR1213-13: Honoring Ricky Byrdsong
	•	Paul: I'm here to introduce a concept- Ricky Byrdsong was the first and only African American basketball coach at Northwestern. He was a symbol and brought the team to a considerable point of national recognition. He died on a shooting spree motivated by racial hatred. He was shot in Skokie a year after his coaching position was terminated. This situation isn't well known, but there are many books and articles about this in the context of social justice. We think it matters because the way you set the tone for a community is how you take a stand for issues like this.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Jesse: Why now? Was there an event that brought this to people's attention?
	•	Paul: I knew about this in grade school, but it shouldn't be any later
	•	Alexander: What would be a more appropriate way to address this?
	•	Paul: Don't know, but wouldn't be opposed to some sort of statue or plaque
	•	Petros: Can you clarify the relevance of AON plc to all this
	•	Paul: Corporation in Chicago that Ricky was a part of- sponsors the race against hate every year
	•	Mark: Time sensitivity on this?
	•	Paul: Would like to pass this tonight
	•	Ayanna: With respect to the why now, due to the events that have happened now, there's a growing tension. We'll still be fragmented, but if the university is looking to commemorate things like Willie, why not commemorate this?
	•	Tori: Motion to make this old business.
	•	David: This is great, would like to vote on this, but spoke to a bunch of administrators who believed this death was handled gracefully. No objection to the bill, but would be helpful to look into this and make sure everything is as it actually is. Just looking for more information.
	•	Mark (question): I'd understand if this was more accusatory, can you explain further
	•	David: Just want time to get more information.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con.
	•	Jazzy (con): University had a memorial for Ricky Byrdsong.
	•	Paul (con): The fact that we had to dig back 13 years to figure out how this was handled is the problem. We don't want to make this about the administrator or Northwestern
	•	Jesse (pro): Agree with David- why I asked why specifically now, doesn't seem like time sensitive issue.
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is old business.
	•	April: I think this issue is very important to my constituency, it's all we've been talking about for weeks, and I do have a connection to this and want to celebrate and commemorate his legacy.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Legislation is approved.
IX. New Business: SL1213-27: LENDing a Hand
	•	Guarav: LEND is a microfinance organization with an 18 student staff and an 8 member board of directors consisting of community entrepreneurs. We provide services like microloans- want to serve aspiring entrepreneurs that don't have access to secure financing for a business. Many of these individuals haven't had formal education, but have a craft or skill that is marketable. We have a 100% payback rate and that's admirable. We've received more requests than usual and we've gotten a lot of attention with Evanston establishments. ASG was instrumental to starting LEND, though we're recognized under the Farley Center- we still have the money ASG gave us, it's still being given out as new loans.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Alex: Do you charge interest on your loans?
	•	Guarav: Yes- a 9% interest rate with a 50% refund rate on interest as an incentive for paying back on time. Given the principle of the loans, interest doesn't come out to more than a few hundred dollars.
	•	Jesse: Do those you service have any incentive to pay loans back?
	•	Guarav: Have a strict approval process and get to know people we're lending to, make sure that if we lend to people they'll pay back
	•	Mark: Can you talk more about the things you've funded?
	•	Guarav: First provided a loan to a barbershop for cosmetic renovations. Had become a community centerpiece and used to renovate the entirety of the shop. Second loan was to a painting contractor to purchase a vehicle. Third loan was for jewelry boutique owner. Fourth was to expand a fitness studio. Fifth loan was for ex-offender handyman to buy a vehicle. Sixth loan was for a bridal boutique. We have $19,000 in requested funds that fit the criteria of what we seek to do.
	•	Ian: Do you think it's appropriate that money allocated for student activities be allocated for philanthropic purposes?
	•	Guarav: Everyone that's had some hand in LEND has gotten a lot from it- really a great learning opportunity.
	•	Siddiq: How many members does LEND have?
	•	Guarav: 18, so we've doubled size and believe the group will grow further
	•	Mark: Where else are you seeking funds and have you sought any reciprocity in playing back?
	•	LEND Girl: Looked to groups like global giving, reached out to banks in the area.
	•	Guarav: Reaching out to other prominent organizations in the area as well.
	•	Senator: Do you have many overhead costs?
	•	Guarav: very little- we're volunteer and only costs are associated with capital improvements.
	•	Siddiq: How much in project pool?
	•	Ani: Around $5400- rolls over at the end of spring
	•	Brad: That includes the $1000 from NU day at the united center
	•	Mike (point of information): bring us down to $2400 after allocation?
	•	Ani: Yes
	•	Siddiq: Any events on campus to engage the northwestern community?
	•	Guarav: Event with NCDC- doing microfinance on international scale. Other stuff.
	•	Abby: Motion to extend Senate by 30 minutes
	•	Vote- passed.
X. Old Business: SR1213-12: Sustainability Fund: Authorship Presentation
	•	Mark: This says we support this action.
	•	Jesse: What will this money be used for and why isn't the university subsidizing this?
	•	Brad: This money is for students to create student initiatives. Would allow for funding of things that the university wouldn't usually fund.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question on the amendments
	•	Vote- passed. Amendments are implemented in the bill.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question on the bill
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is approved.
XI. Emergency Legislation/New Business: SL1213-28: Norris Exam Relief
	•	Mark: Motion to make this old business
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is now old business.
	•	Motoki (question): Anything else we can fund besides the slippers?
	•	Ian: Other things, but we can control branding this way.
	•	Brad: Senate doesn't need to follow what SGC and SAFC set for funding guidelines, the project pool is separate from these requirements.
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is approved.
XII. Good of the Order & Announcements
