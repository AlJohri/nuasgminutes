The Polling painted by William Hogarth
	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	General Order: Accreditation Presentation 
	•	Jenny: Northwestern is going through institutional accreditation. I am here to tell you how you and your constituents can be involved. I want to inform you what’s going on, give you opportunities to engage, provide resources and contact information, and sending this information to your constituents. Does anyone know what institutional accreditation is? 
	•	Kevin: It is what allows Northwestern to give degrees. 
	•	Jenny: Why does it matter? 
	•	Bella: Prestige and value of degree. 
	•	Daniel: Federal financial aid. 
	•	Jenny: Institutional accreditation is done in a geographic manner. We are lumped in with about a thousand other schools in the general North/Central part of the US. We are accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. The last time we were reaffirmed was 2005 and we are doing it again this spring. In case you are wondering, we do have a lot of programmatic and specific school accreditation processes happening as well. The one I’m talking about tonight is for the entire institution. Northwestern agreed to be part of a new pilot accreditation process. We are trying to help the HLC and other schools as this process is adapted. Mostly it means we need to submit two written reports in advance of a site visit. Seven peer reviewers are going to come here and talk to people about the university and then evaluate us and make a recommendation to the HLC. The Office of the Provost is administering the process and we have a committee that Anna has been sitting on. We were required to invite you to the HLC’s survey a couple of weeks ago, so you probably got an email asking you to do this. Another way for you to participate is that you can submit written comments to the commission. They need to be substantive comments - it’s not a forum for petty complaints. There is a section on the provost’s website about how to submit hose comments. The main reason I am here is that there are a couple of ways to be involved when the committee is here on April 27th-28th. Students will be invited to an open forum session. It is a time to be honest and explain things that did not meet your expectations as well to gloat. Details will be sent out via Northwestern News and from the Provost’s office. We are also looking for students to serve as guides for the reviewers. This is an opportunity to showcase our students as you’re walking someone from one side of campus to the other. We are exploring golf cart and other options. If you are interested and plan to be on campus and available those dates, I have included contact info. 
	•	Wendy: What other things will the team be doing on campus? 
	•	Jenny: We have to submit a report about our different programs. The majority of the time will be spent speaking with faculty and staff about those programs to confirm what we wrote. 
	•	Nehaarika: Is there any restrictions for who would serve as ambassadors? 
	•	Jenny: No, just responsible and available. We ideally want a mix. I think even freshmen could do it, but campus knowledge would be helpful. 
	•	Moira: I’m assuming you’re taking the process seriously but how much would NU have to mess up to not get reaccredited? 
	•	Jenny:  At large we are not really worried about this. We have a provost who have decided to be a leader in this process, so we are taking this very seriously. It’s more that they could ask us to go a lot of follow up work, so we’re trying to put forward an honest and comprehensive argument so they don’t send us on a wild goose chase. That’s one of the main reasons we are taking it seriously. 
	•	Liz: Do we get some sort of rating? 
	•	Jenny: It’s pretty much pass fail. We get measured on 21 criteria. At the end of the day, my understanding is that we get whether we’ve met that area, we’ve met but there are some concerns, or we have not met that area. There are some comments from the reviewers, but at the end of the day it’s more of the checkmark. 
	•	Domi: Is diversity one of the criteria? 
	•	Jenny: Yes, they ask how our mission and our commitment reflects the diversity of society. It’s worded similarly to that. We’ve put together an argument that talks about our commitment to a diverse population and also the infrastructure, our different groups and offices that are trying to build a diverse community. 
	•	Domi: What does a diverse community look to Northwestern? 
	•	Jenny: To be honest it talks about how we’ve come a long way since 2004. We talk about how we compare to our peers and how we’re looking to improve, but are proud of the changes we’ve made. 
	•	General Order: AFVP Selection Committee 
	•	Andrew: We need one undergraduate member. The application is due on March 1st, so we’ll be holding interviews the following week. 
	•	Noah: This is a really good way to either have a voice in the selection process and contribute or to learn. 
	•	Andrew: You would read the applications, be part of the interviews and the deliberations. 
	•	Mackenzie: AFVP leads a committee and serve as a leading force on the board. You don’t vote, but make sure the board is moving in line with past precedents and our guidelines. Bridging the gaps between A-status groups and Account Executives. You are a resource for things like helping them meet administrators. 
	•	Noah: We are now taking nominations. 
	•	Xavier: I nominate Kevin Cochran. 
	•	Kevin: I accept. 
	•	Kevin: My name is Kevin and I’m a freshman in SESP. I haven’t gotten too involved in ASG yet, but I’m looking forward to it. 
	•	Motion to white ballot. 
	•	No objections. 
	•	Passes unanimously. 
	•	New Business: SR1415-10: Supporting Higher Education Affordability and Illinois MAP Grants
	•	Liz: Erik cannot be here tonight, so I’ve got an authorship speech he wants to read to you all. 
	•	Erik: 
	•	Lauren: Do you know why he included to remove MAP grants from for-profits? 
	•	Moira: I’m guessing it is because for-profit universities fundamentally operate differently, because they are trying to make money. If profit is their motive, the state subsidizing education at those schools would just make tuition go up there. It’s counterintuitive for the state to be subsidizing a corporate institution rather than a non-profit. 
	•	Noah: Are MAP grants given to individuals? 
	•	Liz: Yeah. 
	•	Moira: Through the university. 
	•	Kevin: If they are cut, will Northwestern increase loans or scholarships? 
	•	Liz: They actually have already been cut, this is so when we go to Springfield we can say Northwestern is not okay with it. 
	•	Alec: Has anybody talked to the financial aid office? 
	•	Liz: Erik may have. 
	•	Lauren: Do you know if they’re reducing or cutting them completely? 
	•	Liz: It’s be cut significantly and the resolution is asking it go back to the status quo. 
	•	Roll Call and Adjournment
