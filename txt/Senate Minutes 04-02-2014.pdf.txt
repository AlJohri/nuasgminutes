General Order: Speaker of the Senate Election

• Alex: I would like to nominate you again Katie.
• Katie: I respectively decline. Jobs. Anymore? Please line up so we

• Harrison: Hi, I am a sophomore and the RHA/RCB Caucus Whip. I
have been a senator since fall of my sophomore year. ASG, outside
of school, has been one of my favorite Northwestern experiences.
When I was elected caucus whip, I wanted to make the RHA/RCB
Caucus as robust as possible. I met with all of the senators and
followed up with them about their interests and what they wanted
to get out of ASG as senators. I have been able to help get projects
started. We have no vacancies, our attendance is great. We have
great discussion. I would love to engage Senate at large next year.
I want to make Senate more than just a meeting next year.
• Noah: Hi, I am Noah Star. I am a sophomore. I have served as
NCDC Senator for the past year. I would like to outline my
trajectory in Senate and why I want to be Speaker. I missed
regular orientation last year, and coming in I was a little

overwhelmed by the great students in this room. I was a little
hesitant to speak, but I think my work on the PR committee helped
give me confidence to speak up about my vocal and graphical
interests in ASG. I have now spoken up more about the issues I feel
passionate about in Senate. I am passionate about Senate and
based on my journey, I would like to make you all as passionate as
I am. I have a met with a lot of you. I think there is a lot of areas
for improvement as well things that we are doing well. I have
developed a platform. I think Senate needs to be more democratic,
political, and legislative. I think we need to improve recruitment
and keep our great recruits. I consider myself to democratic. I am
approachable and relatable as a leader. I hope for those I met with
that was apparent. I also will make sure I meet with all of you all if
I were to be elected.
Alex: As Speaker, you would be giving up your ability to debate in
Senate. What is in your opinion more important about you being
Speaker versus having your voice in debate?
Noah: I met with NCDC and asked if they thought my voice was
better served as a Senator or Speaker, and they fully supported me
in running. I think as Speaker you serve all student constituencies.
I speak up when it is necessary and having that type of awareness I
think if I would be elected.
Harrison: I get so much out of Senate by just listening. Also, so
much of what gets done in Senate takes place on committees. I am
confident that Kemper will be able to find a senator that is engaged
and want to help out.
Julia: Can you talk about your experience on a committee will help?
Harrison: I worked on the dining hall working committee. I learned
a lot about Sodexo and the inner workings. I think I would be able
to bring to the Speaker role the skills I learned about working and
talking with administrators.
Noah: I have had 2 main projects with PR. In fall, I helped rewrite
what is going on the rejuvenation ASG website. I had to gather
information about all committees, so I feel like I better understand
them now. In the winter, I worked on the faculty roundtables.
These are pretty intimate settings, and I helped facilitate and

moderated discussion with students and administrators. So, on a
micro scale, I have already moderated student discussion.
Adam: What is your experience with reaching out to the
Northwestern student body?
Noah: I work with a group that helps bring to the surface on the
political issue of the Palestinian and Israeli war. I have taken the
lead on student outreach with that. I have done PR and student
outreach for Mayfest. I worked with sponsorships that students
were looking for and what special events students were looking for.
I love to talk and would love to reach out to students.
Harrison: Last year, I was involved was in Student Life committee. I
also ran for SLVP. During the process, I got the great privilege of
being able to meet with student groups. I got a lot of feedback and
Anna has done a great job working on those issues. I am in a
fraternity, College Republicans, and NUSPAN.
Alex: How good are you guys with names?
Harrison: I am pretty good with names.
Noah: I am pretty good with names. As people are transitioning, I
will make sure that I know people’s names.
Alex: Motion to extend question period by 5 minutes.
Senator: 2nd
[vote passes]
Jacob: In one sentence, what is the most important aspect of being
Speaker?
Noah: To ensure that democracy is met by the Senate body and
that we reach to students.
Harrison: To engage the Senators and the entire northwestern
student body to make sure that they know they are apart of
something bigger than (LISTEN)
Wendy: What will you do to engage senators?
Harrison: I think Senate is an addendum to ASG and the juice we
do besides that. I think working with Senators with what they are
passionate about and be a resource to do what they want.
Noah: I agree with Harrison. I would meet with all new and old
senators. Also, once a month I would like to carve out caucus time
for senators to meet with their committee VP to work on legislative

work they can do for their committee in Senate. I would also be
interested in trying to bring an aspect of Caucus projects back.
• Parag: Speaker serves as a moderator and voice of Senate? What
do you bring as a voice of Senate?
• Noah: I was on the debate team, I also served as a secretary in
high school, I also am the brotherhood chair of Delta Tau Delta. I
have the ability to figure out what the voice of Senate is and bring
that to the exec board and greater Northwestern.
• Harrison: I think being a voice of you all is one of the most
important roles. I think through engagement and meetings and
being a proactive resource is the best way to represent your voice.
I think my caucus has come a huge way this year, and seeing we
had so many freshman, I am so happy with the engagement level
we were able to develop. I am confident so many of you continuing
on next year.
• Katie: I am very pleased to announce that the new Speaker of the
Senate is Noah Star.
General Order: Parliamentarian Election
• Katie: Next up is Parliamentarian. I am opening up the floor for
nominations.
• Grace: I nominate Dana.
• Dana: I accept. I nominate Petros.
• Petros: I accept.
• Katie: Anyone else? I close the nomination floor. You can give an
introductory speech.
• Petros: I am Senator for Rainbow Alliance and Student Groups
Caucus. I became a senator beginning of last year. I was Plex
Senator and now I am Rainbow Alliance Senator. I am Student
Group Caucus Whip for the past year. I was originally a written in
candidate last year, so I was not able to join a committee. I joined
a bunch of ad hoc and working committees, such as dining hall and
gun control. I was then able to join Rules in Spring. I love Rules so
much I brought it back to my exec board on Rainbow Alliance
reforming the constitution twice. Being in the Parliamentary body, I
have interacted a lot with Abby and Katie. I would be able to bring
to the table experience and passion.

Dana: I am a junior and currently the most senior member of
Rules. I have been elected for 3 years now. I have served as a fillin Parliamentarian a few times now as well. Whatever I am involved
in, I really try to dedicate myself to. I wasn’t planning on running,
as I nominated Petros, because I am Election Commissioner. I am
very interested in being Parliamentarian, and I don’t think it is an
issue of doing both jobs, but that is for you all to decide.
• Alex: What is your favorite rule?
• Dana: I have been asked this a lot. I am a big fan of personal
privileges.
• Petros: My favorite is motion to amend for everyone to add in their
idea to improve legislation. My least favorite is point of clarification.
• Dana: Also, asked and answered is not a thing.
• Lauren: Point of personal privilege. What is that?
• Katie: Anything that is not pertinent to senate business.
• Alex: What does Parliamentarian do that you don’t see in Senate
and why would you be good at it?
• Petros: Parliamentarian collects all legislation, and in Rules the
Parliamentarian can call in authors to work with them to improve
legislation and clarify.
• Dana: I would say that a really important part of being
Parliamentarian is being an institution of memory for the Code and
ASG as a whole. One thing I have noticed that Abby has done is
working with authors to help prepare them for questions and
Senate before they get here. I would like to continue that.
• Abby: I am excited to announce my successor is Petros.
General Order: Code Review
• Abby: A lot of the changes are formatting changes and grammatical
errors. These were the more major changes that we made to the
code as a committee. I’ll walk you through them now. The word
undergraduate was missing when referring to substitutes. We
explained what would be an excused absence in committee
meetings, so we clarified for Senate as well. We changed the
makeup of the Student Group Apportionment Committee, by
removing the EVP and the Caucus Whips. We removed Rules going
over the election guidelines.
•

Alex: Why did you remove caucus whips?
Abby: We had low turnout of the committee. We were able to
record meetings, but ten people is hard to coordinate. Because the
Speaker is the voice of Senate on all committees, the Senate is
reflected.
• Lauren: Who else sits on it?
• Abby: Chief of Staff, Speaker of the Senate, FVP, VP of SG, VP of
SA, and Parliamentarian.
• Katie: We are now in line for a vote. All those in favor? Any
opposed? Any abstaining? They passed.
New Business: SR1314-10: Oops!...They Did It Again
• Anna: This resolution was brought in light of the SafeRide changes
to no long offer off campus to off campus rides. About an hour ago,
the petition had over 450 signatures.
• Haley: We are asking the administration to look back on
transportation as whole and how to fill in the current gaps.
• Katie: Questions?
• Dana: Have you talked with SafeRide?
• Haley: I have a meeting set up as of today.
• Anna: I have talked to JPK and PTI and they said that the biggest
issue with SafeRide currently was wait time. And they saw this as a
solution.
• Jane: Would you be opposed to moving this to old business?
• Anna: No.
• Jane: Motion to make this old business.
• Senator: 2nd
[vote passes]
• Katie: Okay this is now old business. Questions?
• Alex: So theoretically, as an off campus resident, can I call a
SafeRide for a ride to on campus and then call another one to go off
campus?
• Haley: Yes, I guess so.
• Alex: So we would actually be increasing the amount of SafeRides
being requested.
•
•

Lauren: In caucus, we talked about this being a concerned of
students going for bar to bar. But this is really an issue of wait
time?
• Anna: That is a concern as well. But SafeRide is not allowed to drop
you off or pick you up at a bar. Wait time was the biggest point for
this change, but I am sure it is then solving that problem as well.
• Petros: Is this an issue of working with Evanston and SafeRides
disrupting them or replacing their taxi services?
• Haley: I know SafeRide has worked in ordinance with Evanston.
• Katie: Any more questions? Okay we will move to debate.
• Alex: Motion to amend.
• Katie: Okay what is it?
• Alex: Whereas, this new policy change may create a perverse
incentive to double the number of SafeRide requests;
• Senator: 2nd
[amendment passes]
• Senator: PQ
• Senator: 2nd
[passes]
Good of the Order & Announcements
• Dana: The campaign period starts in 15 minutes so get excited. The
EVP and President debates will be on Monday at 7 and 8pm in Swift
107.
• Katie: If you guys go to my Facebook profile, my cover photo is an
advertisement for the summer program engage Chicago.
