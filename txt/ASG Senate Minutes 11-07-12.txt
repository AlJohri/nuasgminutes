ASG Senate Minutes
11-07-12

	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	Brad: David also wanted me to talk about the three surveys linked in his exec board report since he can't be here.
	•	Another food truck festival to benefit hurricane sandy damages
	•	Alex: Read my exec board report and be on the lookout for tonight's legislation. Email me if you have questions
	•	Carly: Thanks to those that came out on Friday for the Social- will be planning meetings with Senators in the upcoming weeks
	•	Girish: Funding recommendations are live, look at them.
	•	Steven: OBAMA. Also moving forward with the housing fair and look out for other publicity materials, especially people looking for apartments.
	•	Will also be implementing service through off campus housing office to search for apartments
	•	David Chi: Talked to Ricoh, looking at other printing companies.
	•	Lauren: Not much new- did preliminary work on funding apps- you'll see those next Wednesday.
	•	Mark: Eco-rep program is up and running. There are 40 eco-reps from greek houses and RHA/RCB. If you have ideas about what sort of programming would be appropriate for these reps, let me know. ASG sustainability oversees them.
	•	Hayley: Cool event with the office of the Provost and Political Union about Affirmative Action, December 5th, Harris 107.
	•	Also updates about academic requirement, let me know if you want to get involved
	•	Also putting together cultural DM groups, let me know if you're interested in that.

	•	General Order: New Student Group Subcommittee confirmations
	•	Ani: We're approving the subcommittee you guys created
	•	Ian: Why are we doing confirmations?
	•	Ani: Yeah, they actually don't need to be confirmed since they aren't actual members
	•	Lauren: I want Senate to know about this anyway- The New Student Groups Committee (NSGC) works with new groups- we've had an exponential increase in new student groups and we created a separate committee to oversee this.
	•	Refer people who want to start new student groups to Jesse & Angela, the two new members of the NSGC
	•	Ani: Please introduce yourselves
	•	Angela: I'm sick- let Jesse talk. I'm from Indiana, majoring in psych and a Junior
	•	Jesse: Just transferred here from Miami as a Junior
	•	We both interviewed to be on SGC and Lauren let us know about the large number of new groups and thought that we could help these groups with ASG recognition. It's exciting and lets us work with lots of people. Questions?
	•	Mark: Do you always personify student groups?
	•	Jesse: Sometimes I just giraffify them...

	•	Old Business: SL1213-09: NU Day at the United Center
	•	Brad: CSI wants $1000 from ASG to fund NU Day at the United Center. We get good press, and it's a good service to the student body. Students will get bused down with subsidized tickets and a t-shirt
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian C: Any other confirmed donor organizations in the past week?
	•	Brad: Natalie, do you know?
	•	Natalie: Don't know.
	•	Ian C: To the same end, is there a clearer budget now?
	•	Brad: unfortunately not
	•	Henry: What teams would be playing on each date?
	•	Motoki: Cavaliers on January 7th, Pistons on March 31st
	•	Jane: March 31st is during spring break… so…
	•	Brad: I am pretty confident that if that's the case, CSI wouldn't be looking at it as a date
	•	Noah: The 7th is the beginning of recruitment for sororities
	•	Several Senators: No it's not
	•	Senator: Wouldn't it be hard to sell tickets if it's the first day back?
	•	Brad: CSI would hopefully have most if not all of the tickets sold by then.
	•	Girish: what will this money go toward exactly?
	•	Brad: Could go to tickets, transportation or t-shirts- we could mandate that it goes to a certain area, I'm sure.
	•	Girish: Just trying to figure out the direct benefit of giving them $1000 as opposed to not doing it
	•	Brad: We get publicity, and the first thing they'll take away from the event are tickets for students
	•	Girish: So they don't want to deviate from the ticket price?
	•	Brad: Lots of moving parts, will maximize what money they get, but let me know that they'd reduce tickets sold before increasing ticket prices
	•	Ciara: Are those the only two dates available?
	•	Brad: Still negotiating with Bulls, but will try to work with them to pick a good date. It's CSI, they're not going to pick a date where people won't go
	•	Ian Hendrickson: How far along is this planning process if the date isn't set? Or publicity?
	•	Brad: Came to us at the beginning of the school year, but stuff on campus caused it to be pushed back. Came to us again looking into winter quarter or fall quarter, but need to move on this soon if we're going to give them money
	•	Evan: Most of NU would rather have more seats as opposed to t-shirts. Can we negotiate this?
	•	Brad: T-shirts are a fixed cost, we either buy t-shirts for everyone or for no one. CSI wants to maximize the number of students going to this, obviously, but it's a unity thing having students all there wearing matching t-shirts...
	•	Motoki: So, is the second day on spring break...?
	•	Brad: If that is the case… I don't have a good answer to that question
	•	Nouha: Can we really negotiate that we get less t-shirts and more tickets?
	•	Brad: Bulls won't let us get more than 300 for any individual game right now- hopefully can increase ticket sales next year
	•	Dana: Quality of the tickets?
	•	Brad: All group sales are 300 level seats. They're high up, but not terrible seats
	•	Ani: If no further questions, moving into pro/con
	•	Ian (con): real lack of detail here. Not having a budget for this event is unacceptable, should be able to calculate these costs per capita. And if we don't know if anyone is funding this, we have no way of knowing if we'll reach that $20,000 point to actually fund the event.
	•	Michelle (con): We don't fund new events with our student groups, why do it here?
	•	Girish: Point of Information- while I'd usually agree with you, that procedure is meant to prevent student groups from doing last minute programming spur of the moment- not for University departments like CSI.
	•	Victor (pro): This event is ambiguous and unclear right now, but this is the Center for Student involvement, and that should be taken into consideration. ASG could inspire other groups to fund this, we need to be the leader on this to make sure this gets fully funded. If they can't raise enough money, CSI will cancel it. Our funding could be the difference between 200 or 300 seats. We can communicate that transportation and tickets are a priority. It's important to lend our support for this event as a community and it's a great opportunity to engage with Chicago
	•	Motoki: Motion to amend
	•	Motoki: Amend to add clause - "Be it further enacted by the ASG here assembled, that we recommend CSI to choose a different date"
	•	Motoki: Dates are inconvenient- and injured players might be back in. ASG should have the power to voice student opinion.
	•	Ani: Questions on the amendment?
	•	Mark: Shouldn't we revise our stance to make our funding conditional on a convenient date?
	•	Motoki: Don't think we have that sort of power, but can relay what students want.
	•	April: I feel like this would make it harder for students to attend since it'd be during a busier time
	•	Motoki: Just a way to tell CSI this is what students want. We should cover our ground and try to make sure the best date is picked.
	•	Dana: Just want to say "we'd prefer a later date" with this amendment?
	•	Motoki: Yep
	•	Jesse: Not a question really but...
	•	Ani: Not in line
	•	Ian: Enacting legislation only compels officers and members of ASG to do something, not sure if this amendment is in line…
	•	Noah: Will Ian's point negate this from working?
	•	Ani: Brad will pressure CSI
	•	Ani: If no further questions, we'll move into pro/con on the amendment
	•	Jesse(con): we can trust Brad to actually negotiate this.
	•	Mark (con): if we're so worried about the date, we should make our funding contingent on a good date- otherwise, I trust Brad to negotiate.
	•	Motoki (pro): Mark's idea of us setting a date is a bad idea. We should mandate it to make sure- only way to make sure it will happen
	•	Mark (con): Need carrots and sticks- this amendment doesn't have weight otherwise
	•	Dana (pro): Excited about this event and people are excited, but don't agree with Mark. We need to fund this event no matter what, it gives a good push as things are now
	•	Mark (con): personal stance is that there is no need for an amendment, but if we're going to give a recommendation on the date, we should make it contingent on funding
	•	Vote on amendment- unclear.
	•	Motion: Division
	•	Yea: 22
	•	Opposed: 18
	•	Abstentions: 3
	•	Amendment passes
	•	Motion to previous question
	•	Ani: moving to a vote on the bill as a whole
	•	Vote- approved. Bill is passed.

	•	Old Business: SL1213-10: In-Senate Voting Procedure
	•	Ian: not an exciting bill, but a necessary one. Preferential voting is necessary for democracy
	•	Ian: As things are now, it's just whoever gets the most votes. Way to rectify this is through preferential voting, where you rank selections for a position, eliminate those who don't have enough votes, look at their second choice. Outlined that plural voting system doesn't yield the same results as preferential one. It's good for democracy.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Jesse: How much time will this add to the process?
	•	Ian: Shouldn’t add much more time to the process and that shouldn’t be the reason we don’t want to do this.
	•	Alex Lower: Been voting with plurality for a while now, what prompted this change?
	•	Ian: saw this in code review and realized this is very bad. It's about the same for small elections.
	•	Henry: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Legislation is passed.
	•	Ian: Can the record reflect it passed unanimously?
	•	Ani: Sure, put it on your resume…
	•	Ian: This is important!

	•	New Business: A-Status Funding Recommendations
	•	Girish: You should have funding recommendations now. Make sure you guys are actually thinking about these recommendations. You have full power to change all of this next Wednesday. Let me know if you have any questions
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian H: I didn't get the email
	•	Ani: Not distributed yet by email, it's on the agenda
	•	Ian C: Is this being distributed on the ASG News listserv?
	•	Brad: I can…
	•	Motoki: Will SAFC be doing it's pre-funding hearing to prevent insufficient tiers?
	•	Girish: Yeah, in the past insufficient tiers just led to problems, we sort out a lot of those issues now before funding.

	•	New Business: SL1213-11: Working Group on Dining Hall Hours & Weekend Locations
	•	Ani: McKenzie, Petros- can you guys come up and talk about this?
	•	Petros: In discussions with RHA/RCB caucus and Student Life, we've begun the process of talking to administration about reforming dining hall hours. Most dining halls open too early. Maybe try pushing it back an hour? Also exploring if, on weekends, dining hall options can be expanded. Working group will explore options, send surveys, etc, and report back to senate
	•	McKenzie: Going off of word-of-mouth concerns- hope to use working group to see actual feelings about dining halls
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Mark: Why haven't you met with Sodexho?
	•	Petros: Just at a starting point right now
	•	Alex: Spoke with JPK, and we're arranging meetings like that to happen
	•	Ian C: The legislation says the constituent bodies select the RHA/RCB members of the committee
	•	Petros: Assume it would be determined by caucus whip
	•	Sarah: Legislation says "at minimum" for RHA/RCB members, does that leave room for expansion?
	•	Petros: Exactly!
	•	Ian C: Can non-RHA/RCB caucus people join this?
	•	McKenzie: We welcome others to help work on this if they want to
	•	Motoki: Is the claim that 4:45 is too early for dinner based on research? Or is this where you'll be looking for more data?
	•	Petros: Want to survey on this to gather more data.
	•	Mark: a lot of times we form working groups that seek to change things that end up being out of our hands. Would you be willing to wait on this legislation until meeting with nuCusine and get more info
	•	Petros: if we were to push this legislation back, it wouldn't give us much time following winter break to do all the work.
	•	McKenzie: Student Life was already working on this, a lot of the groundwork has been laid.
	•	Ani: This will be old business next week..
	•	Brad: Motion to make this old business
	•	Mark: Objection
	•	Ani: Moving to a debate on moving to old business. Brad can you speak on the motion?
	•	Brad: would like to make this old business due to funding next week- it'll be an already late Senate and we need everyone's attention directed to funding. Everyone's behind this, let's pass it now.
	•	Mark (con): we have 150 people in ASG who are critical to improving life at NU. This hasn't been well researched, and allocates resources away from Senators on an issue we don't even know if we can address. Let's not pass it until we're sure we can work on this.
	•	Chris (pro): I knew about this last week- I've heard complaints about this since I came here and there's definitely work that we can do
	•	Noah (pro): Also, Sodexho is contracted by administration, so we should contact the administration before contacting Sodexho. Also, the point of a working group is to get more information
	•	Ian C (Question): Why did you decide to assign Senators to work on this issue?
	•	Alex: I didn't- Senator survey showed this to be a relevant issue and figured it'd be good to get Senators involved with this and work with Student Life.
	•	Ian C (Question): Do you think starting investigation right now would be fruitful?
	•	Alex: Yes- JPK is busy, so the sooner we get this on the agenda, sooner things will get done. We're forming this to meet with people and figure out the best options
	•	Ian C: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- approved. Legislation is old business.
	•	Ani: Now old business- do the authors want to say anything else about this legislation?
	•	Petros: All our ideas are suggestions, will do more research before moving on anything. Purpose of working group was to see if it's at all possible.
	•	Alex: Because this is an issue with all students, this might just be a committee to research future ways to improve
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Motoki: Who would the Senator members be?
	•	McKenzie: That's us- left it open so others could get involved though.
	•	Ian: Motion to amend
	•	Should clarify as to how ASG members on the working group are selected
	•	Amendment: "Be it further enacted, that the working group shall consist of, at minimum, two RHA/RCB Senators, appointed by the RHA/RCB Caucus Whip; and two members of the Student Life Committee, appointed by their Student Life Vice President , and up to two  and overseen by the Student Life Vice President and the Speaker of the Senate. "
	•	Clarifies things and allows others to join
	•	Ani: Questions on the amendment?
	•	Motoki: Why these changes?
	•	Ian: Good to clarify that Senate needs to approve and need to consider other stakeholders in this
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question on the amendment
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Legislation is amended.
	•	Dana: Motion to amend
	•	Dana: Change to "most dining halls open at 4:45" and take out subjective claim that this is too early.
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Legislation is amended.
	•	Motoki (Question): Will the working group be formed upon the passage of the bill, or will there be a delay in the working group's start?
	•	Ani: Working group can be started at any time.
	•	Mark: Motion to amend
	•	Mark: Amend final clause to state: "Be it further enacted, that the working group shall report back to Senate no later than February 6, 2013, with comprehensive research on student preferences and concerns regarding dining hall hours and weekend locations; the research shall take into consideration input from administrators and students, as well as proposals for possible changes, in line with practices at peer institutions."
	•	Mark: want solutions to this problem to be well structured and complete
	•	Ian H: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Legislation is amended.
	•	Ogbemi: Motion to amend- disagree with the line that says that there isn't enough room for people to sit.
	•	Ogbemi: I've never seen this, strike part of principle that says "as there is rarely enough space for everyone to sit and eat during peak weekend hours."
	•	Paul (con): In your experience, you might not have seen it, but living in 1835 for 2 years, I've seen bad seating situations, and it can get pretty crowded
	•	Jane (con): has also been a problem in Sargent
	•	Jesse (pro): don't think it's a giant issue, maybe it forces you to make new friends and would lead to increasing dining hall size.
	•	Dana (pro): Just striking inflamatory language, there's still something in the legislation to increase dining hall size
	•	McKenzie: Never our intention to increase size of dining halls
	•	Brad (con): A lot of this can be researched when the working group begins. And the purpose of the principle is to make an argument  Also, students sitting on the ground is well documented problem
	•	Motion to Previous Question
	•	Vote- approved. Legislation is amended.
	•	Motoki: Motion to previous question on the bill
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Bill is passed.

	•	New Business: SL1213-12: NU Hearts Transgender Initiatives
	•	Paul: Last Spring, Rainbow Alliance made gender-neutral bathrooms an issue. Gender neutral bathrooms are single stall bathrooms that can be used by either gender. There are trans-gender students on campus, can make them feel uncomfortable and can raise problems. Bathrooms were put into Tech, but they're really inconvenient and hard to find
	•	Alex: Rainbow will be working on this, it'll be great if diversity and inclusion committee can also get this done. There will be lots of peer institution research, meetings with facilities management.
	•	Paul: Would be made up of 4 members of Rainbow, 2 diversity committee members and 2 senators.
	•	Alex: It would be overseen by Hayley, AVP for Diversity and Inclusion. Asked Rainbow Alliance if they could use help from ASG and they welcomed it.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Jesse: Point of information- what's the problem with handicap bathrooms with single stall?
	•	Paul: no problem, just not a lot of those. 3 gender neutral bathrooms in one wing of tech isn't good enough
	•	Motoki: Any reason that there's no oversight in the Rainbow members selected for this? If it's because they're already working on it, can we meet them?
	•	Alex: the precedent we've set is that the organizations we work with appoint their own members. We gave them freedom to choose who would be appointed
	•	Paul: Wouldn't be a problem, just would be dragging part of the Rainbow exec board to Senate. It just wouldn't be necessary
	•	Mark: Motion to move this to old business
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Bill is now old business.
	•	Ian C: Motion to amend
	•	Two bits
	•	Change reporting date to February 6th
	•	Change wording of how Senators are selected
	•	"Be it further enacted that the ad-hoc committee shall be composed of four members appointed by the Executive Board of the Rainbow Alliance; and two Diversity and Inclusion Committee members, appointed by the Associate Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion and confirmed and two Senators elected by the Associated Student Government upon passing of this legislation.  The group will be overseen by the Associated Student Government Associate Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion."
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Both amendments are now included in the bill.
	•	Ian C: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Bill is passed.

	•	New Business: SR1213-04: Lightwalk Report
	•	Alex: this is the culmination of me and Jane’s work on Lightwalk for the previous 4-5 months.
	•	Jane: it was a long process, met with administrators, surveyed, did the Lightwalk
	•	Alex: this is being proposed now to send to all of the stakeholders and put the full force of Senate behind it.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Motoki: In the final report, will you change abbreviations?
	•	Alex: We can?
	•	Chris: Biggest hope for change that administrators will enact out of this?
	•	Jane: Put lighting near tennis courts on west side of Sheridan
	•	Alex: Administration was confident that all of these changes could be implemented.
	•	Sarah: Are the locations in order of importance?
	•	Jane: Organized by order of importance
	•	Sofia: The survey mentioned survey- how many students responded?
	•	Alex: UBPC survey data, so right around 2000
	•	Motoki: Would some people prefer some of these areas to be dark?
	•	Alex: all of this was based on survey data and observations
	•	David H: I've heard that lighting can be good for muggers since it limits night vision- if lighting is switched, could this be a potential problem?
	•	Alex: this is why this is important- going from light to dark is a problem we have
	•	Legislation is old business...
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Resolution is passed.

	•	Special Order: Election & Confirmation of Gender Neutral Facilities ad-hoc committee
	•	Sarah Watson: (Read by Hayley) “I want to be on this working group because this has been an idea that has been talked about for a long time and I believe that it is an important one. No longer is our society insisting that people subscribe themselves to only male or female, and the facilities of our institution should reflect that.A bathroom should be a safe space for whatever gender someone identifies with. I think that ASG has a unique opportunity considering its relations with other student groups as well as the administration to further push this issue as one that is important to bringing our community closer and making it safer. And, as a member of this working group I will do all that I can to make sure that happens.”
	•	Vote- approved unanimously.
	•	Rachel: (Read by Alex) My name is Rachel Leshin, and I’m a sophomore here at Northwestern currently serving on ASG’s Diversity & Inclusion committee. I’m interested in working on the initiative to establish gender-neutral spaces on campus because I think that in order to model itself as a truly inclusive and accepting place, Northwestern must be willing to accommodate all identities. The system as it stands now, in which the overwhelming majority of facilities are marked as either “male” or “female,” only serves to reinforce a rigid, restrictive binary that leaves certain members of our campus community out of the picture. As a prospective Gender Studies major, I’m a firm believer in the idea that we as individuals have the right to choose our own gender identities, and for some, this may mean straddling both genders, choosing to embrace neither, or finding ground somewhere in between the two. Gender-neutral spaces would ensure that no student felt boxed in by any set of expectations or norms and would work to ensure that all students felt comfortable, welcome, and accepted across campus. As a member of ASG as well as of the larger campus community, I’m passionate about doing all that I can to ensure that Northwestern embodies this ideal.
	•	Vote- approved unanimously.
	•	Nominations open for Senator spots on the Gender Neutral Facilities ad-hoc committee
	•	Ian: I nominate myself
	•	Corey B: I nominate myself
	•	Ciara: I nominate April.
	•	April: I accept
	•	Ian: I rescind my nomination, I'm busy enough already.
	•	Ani: introduce yourselves
	•	Cory: This is a subject I'm interested in and engaged with and I'd like to echo some of the sentiments stated. This is an important and under-represent sect of diversity
	•	April: Friends opened my eyes to issues transgendered people face. We need more gender-neutral bathrooms because it is a big problem that needs to be fixed
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Dana: Other time commitments?
	•	Cory: Not on other ASG standing committees, should have time. Other commitments are small.
	•	Aprli: Work at SPAC, not on a committee and I have time for it, so I'll make time for it
	•	Ian: Motion to white ballot
	•	Ani: means there are as many candidates as spots and to move them immediately into the positions
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Both candidates are confirmed as members of the ad-hoc.

	•	Emergency Legislation: ASG Weakly
	•	Mark: Motion to bring a piece of emergency legislation to the floor
	•	Ian C: Second
	•	Ani: Can you come up and explain the legislation?
	•	Mark: Didn't realize funding was next week- makes sense for it to come up today. Has to do with the formatting of ASG emails- constituents have said it's hard to read or useless, so we need work to improve this.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Brad: We're doing this, why the legislation?
	•	Mark: Felt compelled to do this as a Senator- it’s our responsibility to bring up things we want changed through legislation
	•	Rebecca: Where is this coming from and why?
	•	Mark: A problem with the ASG Weekly is that submitted announcements don't always make it onto the Weekly, we need a better system
	•	Ani: The weekly includes announcements and other things brought up during good of the order. If your announcements didn't make it into the Weekly, you emailed my personal account, rather than my speaker account, and it got lost in my email. It isn't that hard to do.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con on moving this to emergency legislation.
	•	Brad (con): This legislation came as a shock to exec- we're implementing changes to the ASG weekly already, could've come and talked to us about this before proposing legislation.
	•	Ian (question): how long has the process of reforming this been going on and what's the work that's been done?
	•	Brad: we're looking at programs now to do this, and ASG technology is strained already.
	•	Ian (pro): This is the first I've heard of working on a template. Not realistic that it'll magically appear. Will put more constraints on the PR committee to do this and not strain tech committee
	•	Mark (pro): Legislation sets a very specific timeline- and not just about the template. This is about making announcements easier to digest for our constituents
	•	Chris (con): This is a ridiculous timeline. We've talked about not rushing things for weeks, but now we're rushing this to completion in two weeks. Should contact Ethan and other tech individuals
	•	Ian H (Question): Is this new business?
	•	Ani: Emergency legislation once approved is new business, yes.
	•	Rebecca (con): I have a big problem with the fact that this wasn't brought up to exec previously- these sorts of changes should be discussed with exec before we, as Senate, see legislation about it.
	•	Motoki (pro): will trust Brad and Becca for this, but Senate has the power to make exec do things. Let's hear the legislation, we shouldn't just shut it down
	•	Henry (con): not knowing about funding next week is not a good reason to bypass Rules and bring it to the floor directly. There's no excuse for this.
	•	Lauren (con): it's ridiculous to say this is an emergency and Becca should've been consulted. There's no reason to hear this.
	•	McKenzie (con): I'm on Public Relations and we're working on this, just not something we can do instantly
	•	Mark (pro):  Motoki is right, but my constituents came to me about this, so it's our job as Senators to bring legislation. Could pass this into old business now. Would be glad to help with this template, it's not hard to do.
	•	Brad (con): we are happy to have this done by next week- we don't need legislation to do this, stakeholders weren't consulted. We're more than happy to work with you on this- presenting the legislation in this way makes it seem like a power-grab between Senate and Exec.
	•	Ani: In line for a vote on bringing this to the floor
	•	Vote- fails. Legislation on the floor is not made emergency.

	•	Good of the Order and Announcements
	•	Brad: Door decs and flyers are available, come and get them.
	•	Katie: I'm a student coordinator for a program called Amped- apply for it
	•	David: Two DM announcements
	•	DM trivia started 5 mins ago, will go on for a while, you should go over
	•	Launched collaboration with Mighty Nest- all purchases through Mighty Nest will have a portion go to DM
	•	Please take the surveys in my exec board report
	•	Ian: CCI Business Symposium, next week 6-8 in McTrib
	•	Victor: Camp Kesem apps due tonight
	•	Ani: Seniors- fill out DSTA applications
	•	Also fill out the visits form
