I. Call to Order and Roll Call
○ Senate called to order at approximately 7:06 PM.
II. Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
III. Executive Board Reports
IV. General Order: Visit from NU-Q
○ Q: What other schools besides School of Communication are at NU in Qatar?
○ A: Medill School of Journalism
○ Q: What projects have you done in the past?
○ A: We do a lot of cross-campus events and programming in Education City. We also

have sought to expand course offerings.
○ Q: What does your student government look like?
○ A: President, VP, Secretary, Treasurer, 2 Event Coordinators, and 2 Media

Coordinators. There are also two class representatives and 2 major representatives
for each class and major.
○ Q: What kind of events do you have?
○ A: Go Wild Week, dodgeball between faculty and students, Purple Fest, Media

Awards.
○ Q: What are you seeking to improve on for next year?
○ A: Lots of focus on events this past year, and we want to devote more time to issues

that the students encounter. Our new Executive Board will be meeting at the end of
May. Next year's government will focus on making sure students have their voices
heard. We want to make the transition smoother, that way the Government at NU-Q
continues to exist even when officers graduate.

continues to exist even when officers graduate.
○ Q: What else are you doing during your trip to Evanston?
○ A: 10 students have been here studying for the past two quarters. We also have a

group from the Class of 2016 visiting Evanston for the past week.
V. General Order: Funding Primer
○ Serene Darwish and Alex Van Atta give Funding tutorial presentation.
○ Q: Does any amount in the amendment pool not used get rolled over to the next

funding cycle?
○ A: Yes, it would roll over.
VI. Old Business: ASG Operating Budget
○ Erik Zorn and Julia Watson, on behalf of the Budget Committee, present the

2014-2015 ASG Operating Budget to Senate for consideration as Old Business.
○ Q: If support funds are provided for Work-Study, then what is the role of the federal

government here?
○ A: The federal government will not be involved, as the money will be completely

distributed by the university.
○ Q: What is the difference between ASG and SL fund, given they both draw from the

SAF?
○ A: ASG Fund is not growing, while Student Leadership fund will increase with time.
○ Q: If this is a pilot, will ASG have to contribute 10,000 dollars every year?
○ A: Similar model to the Student Internship Grant Program (SIGP). After a certain

period of time, it would be self-sustaining, and probably funded by the university
directly.
○ Q: So the SL Fund is a kickstarter, but is the ASG Fund seen as a recurrent line item?
○ A: Depends on financial need of the Executive Board in the given year. Over time, the

university will take over.
○ Q: How will officers be fired if they aren't doing their job?
○ A: Impeachment, as well as through other measures.
○ Q: How does ASG Fund affect Tech VP fund?
○ A: It replaces it, that way all positions are funded by need rather than financial merit

as an incentive.
○ Q: When the SL Fund begins next year, will it be just our 10K, or will the university

provide money right from the start?
○ A: It depends. We want to see the university raise money, and the new student

enrichment office will be tasked with increasing the funds for the SL Fund.
Q: Will the amount allocated to the ASG Fund be increased/decreased over time?
Senate Minutes Page 2

○ Q: Will the amount allocated to the ASG Fund be increased/decreased over time?
○ A: Yes, the amount is tied to internal research surveying financial need on the Board
○ Q: So this will theoretically increase to 5,000 dollars if 100 percent of the Board is on

work-study?
○ A: Yes, but this will never cover the full work-study stipend for students.
○ Q: Will removal of Technology VP stipend reduce recruitment for the position?
○ A: No, because it has been hard to recruit for that position regardless of if the stipend

is provided or not. This model makes more sense, because it takes need into
consideration.
○ Motion to Amend
 Recruitment from 500 to 400 dollars, Green Consulting from 2500 to 2000,

Conference from 1000 to 500, Wild Ideas from 25,000 to 20,000.
