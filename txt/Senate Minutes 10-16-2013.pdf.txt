Kevin: Fall light walk last night. It was a great turnout from
Evanston and NU. We took a Northern route to Colfax. We were
pleasantly surprised, but we will be compiling a report. We are also
now doing PR for Cats Come to Dinner. Great way for NU students
to connect to Evanston residents. If you know any residents or
students interested, encourage them to sign up!

surveys. We are trying to focus on 3 locations to launch, London is
ready to go. We also met with CR about making Wildcards useable

[Presentation]
Alex: You may have heard we are looking for the AVP for D&I.
When we seek a candidate, how can they work with you?

member of our community. They do not have to be a certain gender
or ethnicity, but can connect with the 4 communities in MSA.
Adam: What events can we get involve in?
Cory: I have flyers. We have 4 groups, so we have a lot for people
to get involved in. I am personally hosting Serenity Nights for
students who want to talk about identity issues. We are also
partnering for CAPS. We also have a queer person of colors group
going on, and it’s about how people identify themselves. We are
open. WE also have Quench, which stands for Queers for lunch. We

are having a professor come in to give a lecture. We have another
event about the stigmas of mental health for the black community.
For Hispanic month, we are partnering with Latino studies. We are
definitely trying to get at the identity issues people are facing. We
are also having Festivale, which is a great way to get a taste of a
bunch of different cultures on campus together. We don’t have too
many Asian American events right now, but we will be having them
soon.
Order: SGC Confirmation
Ani: While we wait, the Happiness Club and I met with a group
called Give back?? Its raised over $16 million. We are having it as a
resource on our website and they are also doing a random acts of
kindness grant. It is a cool opportunity and get to meet people in
Chicago and help improve the lives on Northwestern students. It’s
not to time commitment or strenuous but and interesting
opportunity.
Katie: Neel will you introduce your nominee, then we will vote to
confirm.
Neel: We had SGC recruitment and we chose her from 6 applicants.
So you can start by saying who you are an your qualifications.
Saya: Hi I am Saya, and I am a freshman. I wanted to get involved

Steven: What ASG committees are you involved in?
Adam: None

Senator?

and other student voices.

held a fireside yesterday in my dorm about the tobacco-free
resolution and gauged their reaction to vote accordingly today.
• Katie: I am committed to staying with ASG.
• Dana: Jow do you work with groups if there is an issue of what we
should do about a piece of legislation?

together the issues and try to find compromise
• Adam: I have worked with groups that have nothing in common.
Sometimes we don’t have the best agreements, but work with the
smart student groups to help get their purpose and point across.

Katie: Skipping second round if Rules elections temporarily to
consider this bill
Carolyn: only affect usage, not possession. No ability to search
students. In addition, tobacco policies have been changing all our
lives. Slippery slope, you can’t go back once you start. Initial
opposition, but it tapers off as time goes by and everyone gets used
to it. Tobacco free instead of smoke free, in order to include
potentially unsafe products and maintain uniformity in the
community. Also assures for promotion of overall health for the
students at large. Harder to pass tobacco free after smoking free
because of loss of momentum. Inclusion of COFHE schools in the
proposed amendments. Faculty Senate has already passed a similar
resolution.
Katie: 10 minutes for questions
Harrison: Isn’t tobacco free campus a misleading term?
Carolyn: Generally used terminology for these resolutions.
Jacob: Work with grad students?
Carolyn: Working with med school student.
Jacob: Enforcement on Chicago and Evanston campus?
Carolyn: Ideally yes.
Ronak: Talk to staff?
C: yeah
Adam: Have you talked to campus security?
C: Not yet, we wanted this support first.
Mark: People don’t abide by 25 feet rule, so how will this help?
C: Signage and also getting rid of ash trays.
Evan: What about staff and workers that smoke? Would they have
to go off campus?
C: Yes that it is what they would have to do. 69% of people do
want to quit smoking
Senator: Do you have any stats on here?
C: 3.4% and 12.9% from Searle
Taylor: Do you have any background information that this currently
is working?
Carolyn: The numbers have gone down since 2010.

Adam: Have you talked to any other groups or organizations that
have adopted polices such as this?
Carolyn: Yes….
Senator: How will this be enforced?
Carolyn: signage and will be introduced through spread of word.
Timo: What difficulties have people had with implementing this?
Carolyn: It just take times and changing the social norm.
Isaac: Don’t you think it is harsh to compare an outdoor smoke-free
policy to an indoor policy.
Carolyn: There is no safe space to second hand smoke and areas
are transitioning to these policies slowly.
Elena: Have you talked with administration and staff that will have
to enforce this?
Carolyn: Only some
Sean: Are there any specifics on implementation in the resolution?
Carolyn: No.
Mark: Why is this important to you?
Carolyn: My dad is in public health, and I have grown up wanting to
protect the public health of those around us.
Luke: Timeline?
Carolyn: It depends
Eliza: Are you willing to act as on an advisor for spreading polices
like this, if this were to pass?
Carolyn: Yes
Timo: What are some consequences of not following this?
Carolyn: We can give tickets, but mostly peer encouragement.
Dillon: If the 25 foot rule won’t work, why would this?
Carolyn: Its more about a social norm change, and its harder to
estimate 25 feet.
Senator: Do you have any stats on progress for schools that have
implanted this?
C: A lot are still in the implementation phase.
Taylor: Sheridan sidewalk belongs to Evanston, could students
smoke there?
Carolyn: We will work that out with Evanston health officials.
Katie: We are out of time. We now move into debate.

Dana: Motion to amend. Motion to put in all amendments in red.
“reads amendments”
Senator: 2nd
Katie: Okay we will now move to a vote.
[pass]
Katie: Great those pass. And now we will move into debate.
Petros: I don’t think that this is the solution to a current 25 foot
legislation law, and we shouldn’t put forth more legislation to pass
this. It is up to Evanston to demand for their policies to should
enforce there own issues.
Katie: Pro speech
Sean: I am not 100% sure about the this. I am more in offense of
what Petros said. This is a resolution, not a legislation mandating
action. This isn’t a band aid resolution, but it is for when they go
forth to those to who will find a solution to show that they have
ASG support.
Alex: Hi I’m Alex and I am here to speak against this legislation. As
students, we are adults and should have a right to smoke. And it
would be problematic to staff to go off campus. I think this
resolution breeds mistrust amongst students, and I think going up
to someone and a making a comment about someone else’s health
would breed more problems.
Carolyn: It is about protecting the right of non-smokers, not against
current smokers. We are choosing the right for a clean air and
healthy environment.
Mark: If that is the case, why are you supporting a full tobacco
ban?
Carolyn: It is move to support a healthier life overall, and we don’t
know yet the effects of e-cigarettes.
Isaac: I think that my issue with the resolution is that we are
inflating issues of smoking with all tobacco products. I like clean air,
but it is someone’s right to be able to chew or smoke e-cigarettes. I
think it’s an insane way to look at the world to ban things that are
bad for them. What’s next, cookies? I think that the school needs
less rules not more rules. The closest place on campus for kids to
smoke is Sheridan road. So, logistically everyone would go to

•

•

•

Sheridan road, the most populated area of campus. Is that where
we want all of the smokers of Northwestern to go? Think about it.
Alex: I can understand the issue with e-cigarettes. I do think that
we should keep chewing tobacco. People tend to turn to tobacco if
they can’t smoke to get nicotine. And chewing tobacco is gross if
you have ever seen it and you don’t want to do that either.
Sean: Would you be willing to amend this to be a smoke-free
campus?
Carolyn: I would like to keep e-cigarettes, but if it won’t pass than
this then yes.
David: Motion to amend to take out and e-cigarettes.
Carolyn: Evanston may pass legislation about e-cigarettes.
David: I don’t think that is relevant.
Kevin: It is still under consideration and it is still skeptical.
Katie: All in favor of David's amendments? Opposed? Abstain?
[Passes]
Katie: We are out of time for debate. So we will now move to a
vote.
Senator: Division
[10, 19, 8]
Katie: The resolution fails.
New Business: SL1314-01 The Never Ending Story of the 10K
Initiative
Author Speech/Alex: This is legislation that clarifies the initiative. In
the fall a survey gets released to the student body for ideas on how
to spend $10,000. We go through those ideas and then recommend
approximately 5. Senate then approves or denies those ideas and
they are sent out. Whichever wins the popular vote is then enacted.
A lot of things were passed, but never became part of the ASG
Code. Basically, what happened before was that there were no term
limits, which confused things. If that makes sense at all. You now
must be re-elected every year as an ASG rep. I also added 5-7
submission because that is more clear. And, yeah.
Mark: Why is reasonable similarity to other selection processes
relevant criteria?

Alex: We could combine ideas that are similar. Like benches and
tables.
Mark: Does that not read against ideas that are out of the box?
Alex: No, but if you think so we can amend.
Senator: We fund all of this now?
Alex: Yes
Senator: Can those on the committees submit an idea?
Alex: I don’t know, but it would have to work more as a trust
system
Mark: I don't think that is consequential. It is about finding the best
idea of all students.
Dana: My question is about change from approximately 5 to 5-7.
What if there is only 4? Do we just present a bad idea?
Alex: Ani can speak to this.
Ani: It’s more as a guideline to the committee to not cut so harshly.
Alex: Last year we got 300 submissions, I hope we can find 5.
Senator: How many people vote in the final selection?
Alex: I don't know. I don’t have those numbers first-hand.
Senator: We will put a threshold on how many students are voting
to see if it is worth putting forth $10K?
Alex: I think we do have a good enough turn out of voting to keep
this going. It is a yearly thing. Outreach is definitely critical though.
Dana: Point of Information: last year it was nearly 2000 votes.
Taylor: Last year, it said the money that wasn’t spent last year
would be rolled over. What oversight would we have for budgeting
and making sure we are spending the money smartly.
Alex: We have to give a presentation at the end to Senate about
where the money went, and Senate acts as oversight.
David: Motion to move this to old business.
Katie: Okay, that means we will not wait to next week to go to
debate about the legislation, but we will debate tonight and then
vote on it.
Dana: I object.
Alex: I would normally let this be old business next week, but we
are doing elections next week. And I want to advertise opening for

the committee. And right now there are no term limits. I want to
advertise 3 and 3, instead of I think 2.
Isaac: Why can’t we move elections back a week?
Alex: We want to get started with PR immediately. We did a hard
campaign last year, and I want things to go well again. And we are
already almost 4 weeks in the quarter.
Mark: We are not voting on new ideas, just to codify them right?
Dana: I rescind my objection.
Katie: We will not move to a vote.
David: I motion to PQ.
Mark: Can I amend?
David: I withdraw.
Mark: Can we amend or strike 3a?
Taylor: Motion to amend to say similarity of ideas…
Sean: Yes like similar ideas can be bunched together.
Katie: How would you want to say this?
Mark: Does this need to be in the code?
Abby: Common law
Alex: I just don’t know if we would be able to combine ideas.
Dana: Didn't senate do that last year?
Katie: Yes senate did that last year.
Mark: We all know what we are trying to say, but I don't think it
belongs in that section.
Sean: I think we can combine ideas to free up a slot, but I withdraw
for better wording.
Alex: I motion to amend, add “The committee reserves the right to
combine similar ideas.”
Sean: I like this. Yep. This is what I was wanting to do.
Katie: This would be section 4 and then we would change numbers.
Isaac: Motion to amend to add Senate.
Katie: Not necessary.
Alex: PQ
Senator: 2nd
Katie: Okay we will move to a vote. All of those in favor? Opposed?
Abstaining?

Good of the Order & Announcements
• Abby: Congrats to Isaac, the newest member of Senate.
• Anna: We got 22 new members, which is great and they will fit into
good roles. Jen met with Sodexo about to-go options. Please give
her some feedback
o Jen: So basically, Rachel is marketing head of Sodexo, and
we are looking to roll-out the wildcat to-go plan. We will test
a pilot program in the west side of foster-walker.
o Katie: Any feedback?
o Mark: What happened to great room?
o Anna: Closed.
o Mackenzie: Can we use regular meal swipes for it?
o Rachel: That was the original idea, but it doesn’t work for
unlimited meal plans.
o Katie: Questions?
• Abby: Okay Senate Reform update. I met with Burgie who
determined school wide coverage for the Weekly isn’t feasible. Now
I am working on reaching out to each school. Weinberg is tricky.
School-wide emails aren’t really sent out normally and we cannot
go by department because those who are still undeclared would
never hear from their Senator. I will give you an update when I
hear from the schools.
• Harrison: What did Burgie say?
• Abby: Logistically it wasn’t feasible to send out school wide updates
and announcements about ASG. It is too cumbersome.
• Mark: Tuesday, Seed is bring Adrian Green from Entourage to talk
about green issues.
• Jaime: Saturday morning, 8-10, breakfast on the block, some
sororities are coming to together, $3.
• David: This Sunday, dancer registration for DM starts. If you don’t
know what that is, well you’re not living. Also talk and spread
interest. Also, let me know if there is any interest in creating an
ASG team.
• Katie: My sorority is hosting a slumber-party registered party. We
are also holding a Ztate Fair.
Roll Call and Adjournment

Noah: This money is not sponsoring an event, but to feed students
chips. We should be helping new events happen, not funding
extras.
• Alex: Can you further elaborate on the advertising issue?
• Harrison: I’m sorry that was a miscommunication on our part with
NU World Cup on how project pool funding work.
• Evan: Maybe they meant that Harrison and I are working with them
on behalf of ASG.
• Katie: Pro speech.
• Harrison: I think Ani brought up a lot of issues that should be
addressed. As you can see, we are very surprised by the
advertising. Also, this is not haphazard. We have been planning this
out for a while, but there was no Senate last week to bring up.
• Katie: Con speech
• Sofia: I think in terms of fundraising the pool is an outlet and there
are funding outlets on campus that ISA has relations with for you to
go to. There are B-Status whose complete focus is food and that is
the purpose that put in a concerted effort to fundraise even though
their programming is centered around food. This event will happen
regardless and the event is not about food, it is about the World
Cup.
• Sarah: PQ
• Alex: 2nd
• Katie: Move to a vote
[division: 5, 17, 3]
[legislation fails]
