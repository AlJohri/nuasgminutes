Meeting of the Senate
February, 4, 2014
 
	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	General Order: Survey Time!!!!! 
	•	General Order: NU You
	•	Angela: Northwestern was selected to by the American Heart Association to be part of this project. We are taking the emphasis off of disease and looking at health and we are looking at it across the lifespan. We are looking at population level studies and are here to talk to you about the clinical side of the project. We are mostly interested in health behaviors and we specialize in interventions using technology. The AHA has tasked us with taking on the college population. The health habits picked up during the college era tend to last a lifetime. Our study aims to recruit 500 incoming freshmen. They will be cluster selected from different dorms. Some will be targeting four behaviors on heart health and the others will be having a more holistic intervention. We have talked to provosts and deans and health services, we have a large supportive backing from the administration. We’ve worked with the Delta lab here to get student impact on what they think about health. We’ve done focus groups as well. We care most about diet, physical health, smoking and weight. We’ve learned that you guys really value success academically and we know there is lack of access to healthy food and there are barriers to getting physical activity. You’re overscheduled. Our current features of our applications will have scheduling and things to help prioritize. Also it would have incentives. I say this generally, because nothing has been designed or evaluated. We are interested in doing hackathon like things in design, programming and the evaluation part. We want it to be student driven and functional. That is our overview. I have a couple questions for you guys. Anyone you think we should be talking to? Anything you see missing? Are there significant needs that we’re not aware of? 
	•	Grace: Maybe talking to Sodexo who supplies the food at school. 
	•	Angela: We’ve been in a lot of talks with NU Dining. It’s not totally solidified what some of those features will look like, but there are talks in the back. 
	•	Jonathan: Have you explored exercise facilities? Especially on south campus? 
	•	Angela: While there’s not much we can do about creating a gym, there are some strategies we’re looking at for the dorms selected in the cluster. We are working with residence halls on the space that they have. 
	•	Grace: I know Ayers-CCI has a big room not being used. 
	•	Kaley: Check with the Residential Colleges. PARC has the same thing. 
	•	Daniel: I think it would be interesting to consider the health in different parts of campus. 
	•	Angela: We’ve been brainstorming on how we can expand it after we do the randomization of the freshmen on campus. 
	•	Olivia: Are you taking into account student athletes? 
	•	Angela: Certainly we would want to make sure our whole sample isn’t athletes. We do cluster randomization to make sure we’re getting a diverse group of students. 
	•	Daniel: northwestern gyms offer different classes and there is lack of information about those. 
	•	Lauren: If we could have an app with accurate nutrition information for the food we are given. 
	•	Bella: We would also appreciate that for ready made food. 
	•	Noah: How will you go about being sensitive for students with eating disorders? 
	•	Angela: We do dietary interventions a lot with things like binge eating disorders. We have the ability to track data and flag people and reach out. We wouldn’t recommend it to everyone, but we have data that these interventions do not exacerbate eating disorders. We also have ways for people to turn off features if you are only focused on one thing. 
	•	Robert: Look into the differences between on campus and off campus eating. 
	•	Grace: How do you plan to get 25% of the incoming students doing this? 
	•	Angela: We have access to the admitted students list, so we are reaching out early. We also have incentives. We are also reaching out to PAs to teach them about this. The Pre-Orientation leaders would also be involved in that. We will also be doing booths and recruitment events. Our target is to have them entered into the intervention by the eighth week of school. 
	•	Angela: The monetary rewards are small and not coercive. It would not be equitable to a job or anything. We do have lotteries built in, but again the chances of winning are low enough that they aren’t coercive. 
	•	Brooke: The classes and things that are offered at SPAC are very popular. People would like to have them at a space like Blom. 
	•	General Order: NUDivest 
	•	Noah: We wanted today to be an informational session. We are not presenting legislation. Presentation! At NU Divest we are focusing on two things. We are calling for more transparency, not just for this issue, but for any issues in the future. There have also been some in the past. NU Divest is calling for divestment from Boeing, Caterpillar, Elibt Systems, Hewlett-Packard, G4S and Lockheed Martin. Now I will open the floor to questions. 
	•	-: Why israel specifically when there are other places with human rights violations like Qatar where we have a campus?
	•	Heather: It’s not necessarily calling out Israel, but holding it to a standard of all other places. 
	•	Cynthia: We’re looking at multi-national companies that are complicit in issues in Israel, but also complicit in human rights violations all around the world. G4S in the US is complicit in locking up tons of black and brown bodies. We really want to make sure that it is known that these companies are complicit in human rights violations all around the world. 
	•	Heather: We can’t pick everything and are doing this in particular. In this instance there was a call from the Palestinian people. It is one instance where we can answer a call. 
	•	Cynthia: We come to this from different points. I joined the campaign because I am Chicana. 
	•	Matt: You talk about the fact that these companies have violations all around the world, but the NU Divest resolution mentions specifically companies in Palestine. You say you want to hold Israel to the same standard as everyone else, then why is it only say things about Palestine? 
	•	Noah: There has been a call from Palestinian civil society specifically, not in Qatar, etc. so we are choosing to propose the divestment part of that solidariy. 
	•	Lauren: When are you bringing this before Senate? 
	•	Noah: Someime this quarter. 
	•	John: Would this decrease our ROY and increase our tuition? 
	•	Noah: That’s incredibly unlikely. There are socially responsible investments that would receive equal if not better returns. 
	•	John: Are you aware Boeing is on the NU Board of Trustees? 
	•	Noah: Yes. 
	•	Jake: You associate with BDS who are in support of a one state solution. Will NU Divest take a stand on that? 
	•	Heather: Our stand is that you need human rights before talking about solutions. As Divestment no we are not seeking a specific plan, we don’t want to impose that on them. 
	•	Jake: But by associating yourself with BDS, isn’t it implied? 
	•	Noah: We don’t promote any particular solution to the conflict other than saying we support human rights. 
	•	Cynthia: And we aren’t lawmakers. 
	•	Faheem: Have you reached out and seen the feasibility of divestment? Do you have a timeline? 
	•	Noah: Discussions about divestment in general have not been received well with the administration. We don’t know about timelines until 
	•	Jonathan: Downstairs there is a mural with the state of Israel and NU Divest, which implies divesting from Israel. You say that you aren’t trying to target Israel, then why do you have two messages? 
	•	Heather: I don’t think there are two messages. Pointing our human rights in Israel is not a problem. 
	•	Noah: These human rights issues are happening in Israel and we can’t separate them from the places they occur. 
	•	Kevin: Is this something other schools have done? 
	•	Noah: 6 out of the 8 California schools have. The conversation is happening many places. 
	•	Alex: Do we know for sure that we are invested in these companies? 
	•	Noah: We don’t because of how untransparent Northwestern is, but it is likely that they are. 
	•	General Order: Student Group Senate Seat Apportionment 
	•	Noah: If you are in a student group that may want representation in Senate, make sure to let them know how to apply. 
	•	New Business: Supporting the Real Food Challenge Campus Commitment and Real Food Calculator
	•	Miranda: We are trying to asking Northwestern to commit to pledging 20% for Real Food by 2020. If all universities did this, it would represent a 1 billion dollar shift. 
	•	Alexi: It is in NU’s best interest to do this, because we would be the second of the to 20 universities and the first in the Big Ten to sign on. This would be an opportunity for Northwestern to lead, because so far it has been mostly small liberal arts schools. 
	•	Bella: What has your interaction with Sodexo been? I mean NU Dining…
	•	Miranda: We’ve been meeting with them since August with various degrees of success. We just heard back that they are going to do the calculator to see what NU is at. So we are finally on the same page. 
	•	Nicholas: How correlated is Real Food with healthy eating? 
	•	Miranda: Nutrition is just one of the things we’re dealing with. Mostly we are considered with worker’s rights and environmental issues . Health means a lot of things to a lot of different people, so that’s not the focus of the campaign. 
	•	Daniel: Can you talk about the relationship between GMOs and worker’s rights? 
	•	Miranda: Yeah, it’s not necessarily about health, but about the companies who contribute to cycles of poverty in foreign countries.
	•	Bella: After 20% by 2020, is there a next step? 
	•	Alexi: The amount we pledge is the baseline amount. For example, Bard College has committed to 40%. It really depends on what NU feels like they can commit. Johns Hopkins committed to 35%. 
	•	Lauren: Would this cause food costs to go up? 
	•	Miranda: The short answer is no. What happens with this commitment, a food group is created to figure out how to source Real Food through our budget. At this point NU is probably in the teens, so this isn’t a huge change. 
	•	Olivia: Why are we only doing 20%?
	•	Miranda: We are going with the minimal ask. If Northwestern wants to go higher then we would love to. It’s harder in Chicago because of the weather, but if schools in Minnesota can do it, then I think we can. 
	•	Alexi: More rural schools do have greater access to smaller farmers and Real Food. It is harder for us. 
	•	Miranda: That being said, George Washington has done it, Johns Hopkins has done it. 
	•	Nicholas: With the cost, what’s going to give? How would buying more expensive food not increase costs? 
	•	Miranda: There is an answer to this that I can’t talk about it. There will be room in the Sodexo budget that will be opening soon. There will be changes in the menu, which will probably be a good thing. This would just be a difference in the dining halls, which reduces cost, because produce is produce. 
	•	Nicholas: You clearly have the issue with the rights of workers but organic food will need more labor? 
	•	Miranda: It does require more labor, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. On an organic farm there are more opportunities for working when you’re developing real skills and getting a fairer wage. 
	•	Old  Business: Wild Ideas Funding Slate 
	•	Nicholas: McSA is having a nation of Islam event. They will be bringing in speakers and are collaborating with all different communities. The Hunt is an experimental scavenger hunt in which the goal is to experience something and reduce stress. WAVE Productions has a new production called the anti-play, which is a weird kind of play that is immersive and has no dialogue. The last event is MEChA and they are having a speaker as well. The organization has been great and we think they’ll do a great job. If anybody has a problem with one particular funding item, you can do that. 
	•	Jonathan: Are you aware that this speaker said “the day of judgment will never happen until you fight the jews…” Are you aware that we have an anti-Semitic speaker on the slate? 
	•	Andrew: We were not aware of that. 
	•	Serene: That’s because he is not anti-Semitic, he was quoting other people. 
	•	Grace: How much money is left? 
	•	Nicholas: We have in excess of $20,000 left. 
	•	Ross: Motion to divide the question. Separate the MEChA funding from everything else. I think there are people who disagree with the speaker and the others aren’t controversial. 
	•	Ruba: As someone who has heard him speak before, he is not anti-Semitic. He has been hosted before with ASG money. 
	•	Daniel: Can the people who are claiming he has made remarks present evidence? 
	•	Jonathan: It is called cameraoncampus.org. 
	•	Lauren: Regardless of how you feel about the speaker, clearly it is controversial and the other don’t seem like they will be. We should give everyone the chance to speak on them separately. 
	•	Moira: The camera on campus website says in their tagline that they are pro-Israel. My main point is that we shouldn’t divide a question because to entertain this. The point of the Wild Ideas Committee is not to fund just things that you agree with. There have been lots of speakers that have been brought to campus who are racist. I’m not saying we should have racist speakers, but I don’t think that matters for funding. 
	•	PQ
	•	Second
	•	Noah: We are voting on whether to divide the question. 
	•	Passes 15 - 12 - 2. 
	•	Noah: We are now in discussion on the first three parts of the slate. 
	•	PQ
	•	Second
	•	No Objections
	•	Passes unanimously. 
	•	Noah: We are now in discussion of the final request. 
	•	Jonathan: I only brought this up because I read his quote on a website. If other people are saying that he’s not then I can understand that. I just wanted to bring that up. 
	•	Ariel: Rub can you talk about him more? 
	•	Ruba: He is a widely respected speaker. He is a scholar in ethnic studies and Muslim Studies. I wouldn’t attend his talks if he’s anti-Semitic. The website doesn’t look legitimate to me. if he is anti-Semitic then someone should tell UC Berkeley. 
	•	Isaac: There is no evidence to say that he is anti-Semitic. They all link to each other and quote one person you can’t find information about online. I don’t think we should be funding hate speakers, but we can’t say that about this person. MEChA does good things and I think we should fund them. 
	•	PQ
	•	Second
	•	No Objections
	•	Passes
	•	Old Business: SL1415-10: Undergraduate Discrimination and Harassment Act 2015
	•	Petros: I can understand the skepticism of symbolism, but symbolism is important and has effects. I will be motioning for an amendment that is more concise. 
	•	Petros: Motion to amend. I wanted to change it so that it is more concise and accessible. 
	•	Lauren: Why did you take out the part of ASG not taking action against this? 
	•	Isaac: The point of a constitution is to be active. If we just want to change our intent, we could pass a resolution. It doesn’t demand action, but it also doesn’t preclude it. 
	•	Jake: Would you consider making this not Article I? 
	•	Petros: I just wanted it there because people looking at it wouldn’t need to scroll. 
	•	PQ
	•	Second
	•	No objectons
	•	Amendment passed
	•	Jake: Motion to make this Article V rather than Article I. 
	•	Petros: I wanted it to be number one so that it is right there. I think sometimes people are lazy and maybe they won’t find it. 
	•	Bella: I think logically what is currently at the end should be at the end. I think this merits being at the top. The order between one and four is a small thing, but I don’t think this is necessary. 
	•	Johnny: In terms of the appropriateness of it at the end. The US Constitution, Article VI deals with amendments and then the Bill of Rights follows, which is similar. 
	•	Grace: Motion to amend. Move it to number II. 
	•	Jake: I withdraw mine. 
	•	Moira: I think if someone is going to the constitution and they want to see what ASG does and they see a disclaimer, they will skip over and see what we do. If people don’t want to read it, they’ll skip through it. Disclaimers normally go at the top. 
	•	PQ
	•	Second
	•	Johnny: Objection because I have something to say. 
	•	Withdrawn
	•	Johnny: Moving it to number two will change the flow of the Constitution. Only makes sense at beginning or the end. 
	•	Amendment fails. 
	•	Noah: Now in discussion of original legislation. 
	•	Passes. 
	•	Old  Business: SR1415-07 Active Consent on College Campuses 
	•	Passes unanimously
	•	Roll Call and Adjournment
