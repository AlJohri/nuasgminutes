12-05-12

I. Executive Board Reports
	•	Carly: want to recognize Sofia as the Senator of the Week for running for SAFC when already highly committed to other areas of ASG- great job!
	•	David H: Who was at the food truck festival @ 5? Not enough of you! Good turnout, went well overall- 15% of proceeds went to Cat's Care- will have numbers at first Senate of next quarter
	•	Also still working on cab share- another company is doing this so we're working with them. Will be done before Winter Quarter.
	•	Unofficial Study Abroad Guide will be presented in a bit.
	•	David Chi: To follow up on Carly, check our exec board report, opening more spots on the committee, need more man-power on Operations.
	•	Alex: Sargent Late Night stuff is ramping up publicity, please go.
	•	Just met with JPK about Light Walk to see what's been done and what still needs to be done
	•	About puppies- still figuring out risk management, but will hopefully have it up and running for winter quarter

	•	Brad: 450 submissions for 10K, great turnout compared to last year, but please continue to submit until the deadline on Friday! DSTA deadline was extended please apply!

II. Caucus Whip Reports
	•	Ani: New thing, we're going to try and have this every 2 weeks- basic update of caucus progress.
	•	Ian: Met with University Library Committee- talking about ways to renovate Deering, moving the music library, maps to scan in for transportation library.
	•	To talk about my caucus- no one came to the off-campus forum, but it was a good time. Motoki and Nouha are working on a street cleaning/zoning map for streets- also working on a garage sale. And finally working with off-campus ambassadors, since they were recently selected.
	•	Sarah: for Greek caucus, very new caucus, have been focusing on how to get Senators more acclimated and what we wanted to work on
	•	Paul: We also had a fair bit of turnover and spent time making sure everyone was comfortable in Senate and on a committee. Working on system for reserving meeting rooms and making it more streamlined
	•	Lauren: RHA/RCB spent time transitioning new Senators as well. Also focused on getting Senators in to talk at dorm firesides

III. Special Order: Presentation and Q&A by Burgie Howard, Assistant VP for Student Engagement at Northwestern
	•	Ani: Burgie recently moved to student engagement, we're happy to have him here tonight.
	•	Burgie: JPK works on student services, I work on the fun stuff: Center for Student Involvement, Multicultural Student Affairs, New Student and Family Programs, Fraternity and Sorority Life, and Religious Life- basically where students interact with each other- want to figure out how to knit these five areas together. Also tasked with events shared in common- like March to the Arch. The more common experiences we can create, the more shared experiences for students. Also about connecting alumni services with current students- really looking to connect common experiences, whatever they may be. Been working with ASG to clear up systems and inconsistencies and have a more seamless experience. Discusses trainings for student leaders and advisers and have a more common training experience and get into networking- want to make sure the student network is there so when opportunities arise, students can get them. The idea of how we encourage the interaction between students is my job- small communities are good, but they need to be porous. We're talking about student leadership, student orgs,  and tying resources like SOFO and Wildcat Connection to students. Our departmental strategic plan is being finalized, we're going to actualize it soon.
	•	Ani: Opening the floor for questions-
	•	Sarah: So in the student handbook, the freshman freeze policy was changed and it is soon up reevaluation- how will it be evaluated and is there room for student input?
	•	Burgie: the conversation will be starting in February- been talking to the new IFC and PHA presidents. We'd welcome some input on this and to take an honest look at our progress in achieving the best system possible/
	•	April: How will Wildcat Connection be better utilized as a tool?
	•	Burgie: We haven't fully figured out the total capacity of the platform, but certainly good as a search tool and historical record. Transitions are a large problem, so having a common platform where information is kept is useful. Information now is in the cloud or on someone's hard drive- want to use Wildcat Connection to connect new members of an organization with what's been done in the past. Want all student groups to utilize this. Also want to be able to keep track of groups that have fallen by the wayside, and make sure important documents can exist beyond one generation of a group.
	•	Burgie: If you're a Senator for a particular group, I'm happy to come out and talk/listen to how students experience the university. My office is in Seaburry (600 Haven St.) on the second floor with a lot of other student affairs areas.

IV. General Order: Study Abroad Guide Mock-up
	•	David: We've been working on this with the study-abroad office and they're fully in support of something like this. We're trying to create a more informative study abroad guide that gives students more of an idea of what to expect when going abroad. Yay technology!
	•	Alison: Would've loved to have more experience from peers on study abroad when I was planning my trip- students don't have information relevant to study abroad.
	•	Kallie: You have the study abroad website- which is great to get started, but nothing about the culture or what to do once you get to that country. Trip advisors may not be from Northwestern and are decentralized, and emailing friends is inconvenient.
	•	Alison: So, we want to be able to get study abroad experiences from students- the study abroad office is very excited about this. The demand is there.
	•	Kallie: We want to create a for students, by students guide to studying abroad.
	•	Alison: Not a replacement for study abroad office website, just a supplement. Also not meant to prohibit discovery/education. Finally wants to be important source of students deciding where to study.
	•	Kallie: wants to be able to provide different aspects of city than what's available in resources currently.
	•	Allison: Looking at top 10 most popular places and going off from there contacting students just returning from those destinations. Meant to be easy to update
	•	David: And here's the mock-up
	•	David: Questions?
	•	Mark: How to reconcile particular academic programs vs. locations themselves? Also, some programs integrate sea travel or travel to multiple cities- is there anyway to account for that?
	•	David: Poignant question- hadn't thought of first half of question. Want to prioritize where students go most often, but definitely want to work on that eventually. On the second half of that question- we're still going to stick to core locations, but this would still hopefully be helpful for the cities you're visiting. This will touch a lot of different students and don't want to confound it too much by adding too much into the equation
	•	Kallie: even if it doesn't have specific information, could still be listed as a destination on the application.
	•	Sarah: For the contributions tab, would my responses go straight up or would the responses be partially posted based on what's relevant?
	•	David: The latter- we'll be looking for information that lines up with our format and determining whether a contribution is even relevant.
	•	Sofia: Any way to assign priority to responses?
	•	David: Good point, though might be hard to implement technically. Might be feasible further down the road, but don't want to let it hinder us releasing this. Definitely something to look into.
	•	Mark: There are other opportunities to get off campus besides study abroad, like those in fellowship or other study programs, might be a good idea to reach out to this crowd as well.
	•	David: Good idea.
	•	David: Please email me with further questions!

	•	Caroline: Haven't selected a venue yet, so not totally sure of the cost, but $300 is standardized for most venues.

	•	Ben: Motion to add a group/line item to list- Northwestern Flipside requesting $200 for paper and ink for printing
	•	Ben: Hi, I'm the Treasurer for the Northwestern Flipside, Northwestern’s satirical publication. Dropped the ball and forgot to request funding this quarter. We're NU's satirical publication on campus, we rely on ASG funding for our issues and without it, it's nearly impossible. The $200 is for paper and ink.
	•	Ani: First need to approve adding the item to the list and then the amount.
	•	SGC (Lauren): I support them being added to the list
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- approved. Flipside is added to the list.
	•	Ben: $200 is standardized cost that we’ve received from ASG in the past that allows us to print 2-3 times a quarter.
	•	Ani: questions?
	•	Sarah: if someone forgets to turn in funding is there a standard penalty?
	•	Lauren: still figuring this out, had our first run in with this last quarter, empirically made a 50% cut.
	•	Ian: Why should we fund you in full?
	•	Ben: Complete oversight on my part- we rely on ASG for funding and it'd be pretty rough on us.
	•	Jane: Motion to amend- decrease request by 20%- down to $160.
	•	Jane: There should be some penalty, but as an organization, we have to have some penalty. We want to still give money, just a little less
	•	Carly (question): Has Flipside had problems with turning in funding applications in the past?
	•	Lauren: Flipside is fairly new for funding, actually. Only started applying for funding 4 quarters ago after determining that the publication was Flipside's primary source of programming and that funding should be allotted to them.
	•	Alex (question): how important is a steady precedent for turning in applications on time?
	•	Lauren: pretty important- great that you're here, but I've let other groups who've tried to turn in their application late that they're just out of luck. Things would be crazy if every group tried to submit late.
	•	McKenzie (question): Any success with attracting advertisers?
	•	Ben: success with online advertising, but need more time putting out consistent print advertising
	•	Noah (question): How much does $200 get you as far as issues goes? Like would funding you $160 versus $200 lead to only 1.8 issues being able to be made, and would that .8 just not happen?
	•	Ben: we'd just print less issues overall- we'll deal with whatever amount we get, but less money means less issues.
	•	Petros (question): What would you stand to lose as far as advertisers from this penalty?
	•	Ben: Hard to say, but advertisers don't want to advertise in a publication that isn't regularly or widely  released.
	•	Ian (question): Is all content available on your website?
	•	Ben: we have some print exclusive content
	•	Chris: Motion to Previous question
	•	Mark: Objection
	•	Chris: Withdrawn
	•	Jesse: As a note, let's keep in mind that not funding this wouldn't necessarily be killing the project, just would force them to find other sources of funding and fundraise.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con.
	•	Ian (pro): Penalty is generous, won't limit issues, but a good move to show there's a penalty for turning this in late
	•	Motoki (con): Funded them usually at $150 in previous cycles, want to recommend much lower since this would be an increase as is.
	•	Ben (pro): Yes, we were originally allocated $150, but in-Senate appeals have gotten us up to $200 with every funding cycle in the past- didn't mean to mislead, just quoting the amount we empirically got at the end of the day.
	•	Mark (pro): We always grant them the extra $50, lets just do it.
	•	Jesse (con): For us to have given them funding, they should've turned in their app on time. Shouldn't fund at all, really.
	•	Motoki: Motion to amend the amendment to $100
	•	Rebecca: Objection
	•	Motoki (pro): This is what the SGC recommends- our recommendation every quarter has been $150- giving them additional funding restricts the funding pool and penalizes other groups. Bad precedent to set.
	•	Jane (con): this is stupid- let's not penalize them this much. It's $30-$40 and will significantly help their programming.
	•	Ani: Let's move away from calling fellow Senator's motions stupid and ad hominem attacks.
	•	Lauren (pro): Please consider this- this application was turned in last night, the applications were due in October. Feel uncomfortable only cutting 20%. Though he makes a good case, cuts like this sometimes need to be made to preserve fairness for all groups.
	•	SGC GE (con): Sent out recommendations last week, so had a week to send in application, sent it in last night.

	•	[Confusion]

	•	Ian: Motion to previous question on hearing the amendment
	•	Vote on seeing the amendment
	•	14 yea
	•	4 nay
	•	6 abstentions
	•	Vote-passed. Amendment will be heard.
	•	Mike (question): what is the exposure for your print issues?
	•	Ben: Distribute in various locations around campus- roughly 90% of campus is covered
	•	David: How much of this screw up was on you, vs. the group?
	•	Ben: Completely on me.
	•	Ani: In line for pro/con on reducing to $100
	•	Mike (con): too harsh of a penalty for one person's fault
	•	Senator: Really successful distribution, no need to cut.
	•	Ian (pro): is in line with SGC allotment and is honestly fairer taking into account initial SGC recommendations in the past
	•	SGC GE (pro): we support their programming, but need to have consistency. Let them do fundraising for this cycle.
	•	Lauren (pro): This is not a question of their merit, it's a question of them not following procedure and setting a precedent
	•	Mark (con): We are a legislative body, this is up to us despite what the SGC says. I'm supportive of $160- I find this all exhausting.
	•	Lauren (pro): We know these groups, please value our opinions as we spend all year working on this.
	•	Victor (pro): precedent matters a lot- will fundamentally augment how student groups will look at this
	•	Motion to previous question
	•	Vote-  
	•	12 yea
	•	8 nay
	•	8 abstentions
	•	Vote- passed. Line item is approved.
	•	Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote-passed. NU Flipside is granted $100.
	•	Ani: Moving to the second add round.
	•	Senator: Motion to close add round.
	•	Vote- passed. Second add round is closed.
	•	Ani: Funding is closed.

VI. Old Business: SL1213-15: Increasing Election Transparency
	•	Steven: Elections happened- there's a large grey area not regulated by any party, the period before the election period in which meetings happen with stakeholders. Anyone considering running must declare their intention on running to the rules committee.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Rebecca: Is this legislation just for positions of Pres and VP?
	•	Steven: All campus-wide elected positions.
	•	Jesse: How to enforce this?
	•	Steven: Logistical mechanisms need to be enforced- make sure that student groups know this is a thing. Really down to the Rules committee.
	•	Jesse: What would be the consequences of violating this?
	•	Steven: Campaign violation possibly- if you get three, you're out of the race.
	•	Motoki: Is this necessary since Rules oversees this? Need for this legislation when Rules can manage this?
	•	Steven: These meetings aren't against the Rules- want to consider these meetings as verbal campaigning. Need for clarification.
	•	Sarah: Would you be open to just editing the election guidelines to better define verbal campaigning?
	•	Steven: Hard to pinpoint what is and isn't verbal campaigning.
	•	David: Would another problem be that there isn't a clear mechanism for identifying campaign violations when there aren't candidates?
	•	Steven: That's part of it
	•	Ian: Is this declaration for broadcast or just for the purposes of meeting with students?
	•	Steven: Important for people to know they can talk about their platform openly, which restricts those who are unclear with the Rules.
	•	Sarah: We have an info session annually before the campaigning period to outline rules surrounding this- is the problem that the election info session is held too late?
	•	Brad: Definitely doesn't occur soon enough- yet if you hold it 3 months prior, most people haven't yet made up their mind about running.
	•	Steven: Again, this isn't a binding declaration
	•	Brad: a friendly amendment to this legislation would be requiring that that meeting gets held earlier.
	•	Sarah: Why can't that meeting happen if we make it well enough known?
	•	Brad: You could declare at any time with this
	•	Sarah: What's stopping people from going into Rules and asking about it?
	•	Steven: Didn't have the Rules Committee available as a resource to those running last year- multiple interpretations were floating around. It's for everyone else to know, would free up individuals to declare their intention to run.
	•	Rachel: Who could declare?
	•	Steven: Anyone who is interested
	•	Hannah: Is this just an issue of making the rules clearer and publicizing better?
	•	Steven: this is an attempt to clarify the rules, in a place where the election process isn't clear- there's nothing in the guidelines about the time before the election period.
	•	Brad: we don't want anyone saying you can't have these meetings- they're informative and necessary to forming your platform and make the campaign stronger and make better candidates- unfortunately, no means to regulate this are available now.
	•	Mike: Just trying to get an idea of this- what's trying to be accomplished with this?
	•	Steven: This isn't air-tight- this is meant to target high profile meetings in which endorsements are involved, where people meet with student leaders to get ideas of what student leaders want to get an endorsement in the end. It can get shady- it happens and we don't think it's the best way of conducting an election.
	•	Rachel: Why not just add to the rules that you declare you're running?
	•	Steven: On principle, this needs to happen
	•	Ani: To restate the election guidelines on this matter… "Verbal campaigning shall be defined as campaigning that consists of spoken words and does not involve any written materials. "
	•	Sarah: It's the goal of ASG that all interested parties know about this information- how doesn't this start the election much earlier?
	•	Steven: Safeguards put in place, like prohibiting campaign interaction with media. Daily needs two verifiable sources and anonymous leaked info isn't used.
	•	Ian: Do you see the list of names being the responsibility of the Rules committee and utilized for violations? Or something that anyone who asks can get?
	•	Steven: Not completely sure, I'd be amenable to Senate giving feedback on this.
	•	Rachel: Would this give those in Senate an advantage since only Senate is being told?
	•	Steven: Passing this would lead to that being less likely, actually.
	•	David: Motion to amend- add in the requirement of meeting with the election commission after declaring.
	•	David: Add in the line: "and have a meeting with the Election Commission"
	•	David: Also edit language to state: "Only students who have officially declared that they are exploring the possibility of running for office may schedule formal or informal meetings with student leaders and administrators for the purpose of planning their campaigns or creating campaign platforms."
	•	Rebecca: Was under the impression that this is supposed to start campaigning in Winter...
	•	Brad: Important to acknowledge that four campaign teams have already met with me even this quarter.
	•	Mike: Can we table this?
	•	Ani: Yes, we could.
	•	David: Motion to previous question on the amendment.
	•	Vote- passes. Amendments are integrated into the legislation.
	•	Steven: Motion to amend to add to the bill that students who have considered running, and their campaign, cannot discuss any parts of the campaign with the media.
	•	Steven: withdrawn
	•	Ani: Moving to pro/con on the legislation
	•	Carly (con): Basically daring the Daily to start writing stories, would start campaign period early and would make us an organization that spends most of its time campaigning.
	•	Ian: Motion to amend: add line "The identity of the persons declaring intentions must be held confidential"
	•	Ian: Names shouldn’t be open to others- undermines the process, should only be used by election commission for the purposes of determining violations.
	•	Katie (question): doesn't this just create more work for Rules?
	•	Ian: Important to just leave it on file and for Rules to not inadvertently reveal others are running
	•	David: Point of clarification- if you're running and you're any student, you can confirm, right?
	•	Ian: Making this clearer is required.
	•	Sarah: Confused as to what this changes and does not change- would it now be in the guidelines to tell people that you're considering to run, but don't want the EC to declare that?
	•	Ian: names should only be used for campaign violations down the road
	•	Steven: Would you be amenable to trying to address some of the concerns during pro/con on the bill, since we haven't even been able to discuss it yet?
	•	Ian: I'm leaving my amendment on the table.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con on Ian's amendment
	•	Brad: Amendment to amendment: Include the President and Executive Vice President in the crowd of people allowed to know who's running.
	•	Brad: We get approached by many people who want to run, and provide insight to them, really awkward if we can't talk to them.
	•	Brad: Doesn't want to add AVP or SLVP because of complications- we are the highest office, should come to us with interest in running since you can't really supersede our positions.
	•	Lauren (question): Why can't they just talk to you, nothing really against this?
	•	Brad: Puts us in a awkward position by violating our own rules

	•	[Confusion]

	•	Steven (con): this amendment is only useful when blocking everyone from knowing, won't cause media-shitstorm
	•	Motoki: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- fails. Brad's amendment is defeated.
	•	Sarah: Motion to table indefinitely
	•	Senator: Objection
	•	Sarah (pro): This is significant, we need to look at this- but most parties debating this are authors on this bill- evidence that we need to discuss this more outside of Senate. Should be concrete before this comes to the floor and that starts with a full understanding by the authors
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con on whether or not to table indefinitiely
	•	David (con): Since Isaac tabled my bill freshman year, will always urge not to table bills. It's really silly. This either needs to be defeated or not, this is the place and time to do it.
	•	Chris (question): Why can't we postpone this until the first Senate of next quarter?
	•	David: If this fails, there needs to be another bill to address this, if not, it needs to be enacted ASAP ideally, since people are having these meetings right now.
	•	Brad (pro): what this bill is trying to get at is that it has profound implications we haven't explored yet- we tabled the bill because of this conversation. Something about it needs to change.
	•	Rebecca (con): this is the place where we have these debates and propose amendments and have questions. We have so many questions that need to be heard.
	•	Steven (con): no major change- status quo doesn't work- need to see suggestions for change
	•	Vote-approved. This bill is tabled indefinitely.

VII. New Business: SL1213-16: Freshman Freeze Working Group
	•	Sarah: we're going to make this quick- going to motion to table this indefinitely since we found out that there are other parties who want to be involved with this that we haven't been able to meet with.
	•	Vote- approved. Legislation is tabled indefinitely.

VIII. New Business: SL1213-17: Sustainability Stickers
	•	Mark: Really straightforward, considering the other stuff we've gotten through tonight. Just want $100 to print stickers to put on all of the resources we'll be distributing, like low-flow shower heads and shower timers.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Noah: to apply these stickers, you have to peel them off individually from paper- how will you deal with this waste?
	•	Mark: Will be dealt with appropriately.
	•	Ian: Will these stickers fit on everything you want to distribute?
