	•	Isaac Hassan (accepted)
	•	Speeches
	•	Isaac: 2nd year serving on Senate.  He really loves Parliamentary procedure.  There are a few things that he loves more than Parliamentary procedure.  Has read through Roberts Rules of Order a number of times.  Believes that this is a crucial time for Parliamentary elections.
	•	Francis: Is a junior.  Has been on Senate since Freshmen year.  Believes that a Parliamentarian really needs to help senators write legislation.  Should have a person who is able to help senators in this very important process.  Also—the Parliamentarian sits on the Exec Board
	•	Questions
	•	Q: Isaac, how will you use your lack of Rules experience to your advantage, Francis, how will you use your Rules experience?
	•	A: Isaac: While not on rules, is very familiar with Roberts Rules and the ASG code.  Thinks it would be good to have a new enthusiastic face on Rules.
	•	A: Francis: Is familiar with the workings of Rules
	•	Q: What role do you think you will play on the exec board?
	•	A: Francis: Would make sure that everyone on exec would know what’s going on with legislation and to be a voice of students and senate within the exec.
	•	A: Isaac: One of the great jobs of Parliamentarian is to get things accomplished in the most efficient manner possible.
	•	Q: Is this just an interim position
	•	Wilson: Yes, this position will be held until the return of the former speaker.
	•	Q: Take me step by step through the legislative process?
	•	A: Isaac: Would read through your idea.  Would take your through the templates.  Would schedule a meeting.  Would write the legislation.  The legislation would go to Rules.  Would be reviewed.  Would be New business, then Old business.
	•	A: Francis: The only other thing that I would mention, is that you as a senator who wants to write legislation can actually attend the rules committee meeting and you can be there every step of the review process
	•	Q: Can you meet from 7-9 on Sundays, and 6-7 on Wednesdays?  And have you run a group before?
	•	A: Francis: Yes, free those times.  In high school ran meetings for a certain club.  Also has sat on the Rules committee.  Thinks that there are a couple important things as a leader to do—to really keep people on task.
	•	A: Isaac: Yes, can make those meetings.  In high school ran campus congress (like ASG but in high school).  Would love to make the Rules committee accessible to the student body.  Only found out that you could attend meetings this year, but would love to advertise this to senators and students.
	•	Q: Isaac, you said that you were an expert in Roberts Rules.  Can you state the four basic motions?
	•	A: Isaac: Motions to end debate.  Motions to extend time.  Motions to suspend the Rules.  Motions to adjourn… Not really sure what you’re looking for?  There are a lot of motions...
	•	Wilson: Let’s move past this questions

	•	Old Business: Supplemental  Funding
	•	Emma Kerr: [Introduction] Every senator should have received a paddle—just to make sure that only senators vote.
	•	Wilson: We have two rounds in which we go through the student groups.  The first is a cut round, the second is the add round. [description of process of supplemental funding].
	•	Q: So say we’ve been recommended x amount of dollars, do we have to motion to receive that money?
	•	A: Emma: You will receive the money allocated unless there is an appeal

	•	Motion to Add
	•	Seconded
	•	Pro Speech: Co-Presidents of NiteSkool.  Would like to ask for $500 more for our spring show case.  While appreciative of what we’ve been given, would like to seek clarification.  Without this $500 we would not be able to put on a spring showcase.  There’s a lot of amazing talent on campus, and we would love to find these artists and share that music with Northwestern students.
	•	Questions
	•	Q: If we were not to fund the $500, what would happen to the $1000?
	•	A: That money is for our music video.
	•	Q: Have you considered fundraising?
	•	A: We have, but we already aggressively fundraise for our music video and it would be difficult to gain more.
	•	Q: In years past, you received funds from the school of comm. for the music video.  Will that happen?
	•	A: Nothing is confirmed yet.
	•	 Con Speech: This is more of an explanation as to why there is a changed request.  Originally, the artist showcase was going to be held on the Norris East Lawn.  The numbers that they requested were hazy.  We decided that it would be best to move them into the Louis Room, and we brought down their request from $1000 to $500.
	•	Questions
	•	Point of Information: Do you have a date for the show?
	•	A: No.  We’re waiting until we know what our finances are.
	•	Pro Speech: None
	•	Vote to allocate $500 to NiteSkool for Sound & Sight
	•	Passed
	•	Lovers and Madmen
	•	CSA
	•	Motion to add $400 for Spring fund for airfare
	•	Seconded
	•	Pro Speech: Treasurer of CSA.  Would like $400 for our speaker’s airfare.  We originally asked for $700, because we had wanted to fly someone out from California, but we didn’t realize there was a standard airfare number ($400) so we are now altering our request.
	•	Con Speech: Just to explain our reasoning—there was an insufficient tier and we didn’t feel that $700 was appropriate
	•	Pro Speech: None
	•	Vote
	•	Passed (Allocating $400 for CSA spring speakers airfare)
	•	Motion to add $400 for Sound & Light to CSA’s game show
	•	Seconded
	•	Pro Speech: This spring we are requesting $400 for a fund game night.  Our original request was $1200, but that was from two years past.  But we are reevaluating our request.
	•	Con Speech: We would love to see CSA put on this event.  It was just a huge tier increase.
	•	Vote to allocate $400 to the CSA gameshow
	•	Passed
	•	SEED
	•	SASA/MCSA
	•	Mayfest
	•	Motion to add $2650 to stage re-design
	•	Seconded
	•	 Pro Speech: We are asking $2650 for stage re-design.  Last year we were able to get the stage closer to students with a funding.  There was a miscommunication.
	•	Con Speech: The stage allows for less crowding at the front of the stage.  Was a simple miscommunication
	•	Pro Speech: None
	•	Vote to allocate $2650 to Mayfest for stage re-design
	•	Passed
	•	SASA
	•	Motion to add $600 to administrative line for a computer
	•	Pro Speech: Originally we were asking for a laptop computer, SAFC believes that all of our tasks could be used on a desktop computer.  We would really like to build a database on one computer.
	•	Questions
	•	Q: When you say mass producing DVDs, How many do you mean?
	•	A: Demand is about 100, but last year we were only able to produce about 15-20.
	•	Q: Have you pursued any other avenues for fundraising for this?
	•	A: Yes, but at this moment this seems to be our best option.
	•	Con Speech: They had originally asked for a laptop.  We have standardized the cost of a desktop computer at $600.  Also, burning DVDs is better on a desktop.
	•	Pro Speech: None
	•	Vote to allocate $600 to SASA for computer
	•	Passed
	•	College Republicans
	•	Motion to increase funding of $200 for spring speaker
	•	Pro Speech: Attendance decreased on their spring speaker, but do not think that that decrease merited a decrease in funding.
	•	Questions
	•	Q: What were you allocated before?  And what would you use that money for?
	•	A: We are allocated $
	•	Q: You mentioned that attendance of College Republicans did not decrease.  How did you determine that?
	•	A: We had a co-sponsorship the previous year.
	•	Con Speech: None
	•	Vote to allocate additional $200 College Republicans to spring speaker
	•	Passed
	•	MCSA
	•	NCDC
	•	Motion to add $2500 to advocacy.  Breakdown: 1860 honorarium , 300 airfare, 100 ground transportation, 140 hotel, 100 publicity
	•	Pro Speech: We are applying for a co-sponsorship with FMO for this spring advocacy.  We had insufficient tiering and so we are altering our request.  We are applying for this funding to provide a great event.
	•	Con Speech: Basically it was just tiering issues.  Believe that $2500 is a reasonable number
	•	Pro Speech: Just wanted to clarify: the co-sponsorship is because of overlapping interests.
	•	Questions
	•	Q: Can you tell us a little about the planned event
	•	A: Looking to bring a speaker.  The spring advocacy is about issues of social justice.  We have already been in contact with the speaker.
	•	Con Speech: None
	•	Vote to allocate $2500 for NCDC for advocacy event
	•	Passed
	•	WAVE
	•	ASA
	•	CaribNation
	•	A&O
	•	Motion to add $1600 to line item staging and $1600 to line item lighting and  $5672 to honorarium 
	•	Pro Speech: DM and A&O are co-sponsoring this event.  A&O traditionally has a very successful spring concert.  DM thinks it would be great to work with them.  This is an event that A&O has traditionally co-sponsored with another group, but they have decided to change.
	•	Questions
	•	Q: How much of an increase is this?
	•	A: All told, this funding increase gets us back to the amount we were funded last year.
	•	Q: How much money was raised for DM from this event last year?
	•	A: Wasn’t actually with DM.
	•	Q: How would DM plan on helping with this event?
	•	A: We a large organization and would help with promotion and in any other ways.
	•	Q: What have you done to green your practices this year?
	•	A: Actually changed our car practices to be more green.
	•	Q: How much are you planning on charging for tickets?
	•	A: Not set yet, but previously charged $5, and do not see any reason for an increase.
	•	Con Speech: We support this event.  It has been successful in the past.  However, if you look at the event and how it was put on last year, attendance was subjective, and some sources say that there was a slight decrease in attendance.  Therefore we believe that we should reflect this decrease in funding.  We also don’t understand how well this new pairing will operate.
	•	Question
	•	Q: How sure is this attendance decrease?
	•	A: We are actually in support of certain line item increases, and if they amend their request we will happily fund it.
	•	Pro Speech: Head count was difficult.  Contacted the police to see if they had an estimate, but even they said that it was hard to tell.  But would be open to a friendly amendment for a slight decrease.
	•	Con Speech: Want to move away from attendance issues.  But would like to focus on the makeup of this co-sponsorship.  While DM and A&O are both great groups, they have not yet worked together in the past.  DM is a B status group—they are a little less accountable to the SAFC and we are therefore a little cautious.  However, we would like to see this even happen.
	•	Question
	•	Q: Why do you think that DM as a B status group will be different?
	•	A: We have not yet seen how this partnership will play out—it is less about the group being B status and more about the fact that this partnership is new.
	•	Motion to split the line items
	•	Vote for $1600 for staging
	•	Passed 
	•	Vote for $1600 for lighting
	•	Passed 
	•	Vote for $5372 to honorarium
	•	Passed
	•	Motion to Change Winter Comedian to Winter Comedian Series
	•	Emma: On petition, ask for Winter Comedian Speaker.  
	•	Pro Speech: In the past couple of years we were able to bring in 2 speakers in the winter.  In the past we were funded for one event, but we saved money for that event, and after we had to petition the SAFC for allocating that money to a second speaker.  We want to change the funding from a Winter Comedian to a Winter Comedian Series to allow for more flexibility.  Also, is simply more cost-efficient.  Both events will still have to be approved from the SAFC.
	•	Motion to extend time for 2 minutes
	•	Seconded
	•	Vote to extend time of pro speech 2 minutes
	•	Passed
	•	Questions
	•	Q: Are you asking for a loan?
	•	A: What ends up happening is that is a student group doesn’t end up spending all of the money for an event, it goes back into the pool.  Not asking for more money or a loan, but just asking to split the money up front rather than having to petition.
	•	Q: Why can’t you just fund two events?
	•	A: Just a matter of history.
	•	Con Speech: Is glad that this is coming before Senate.  No other group has this kind of discretion over their funds.  But they way the petition is set out is that there is no delineation of the speaker’s caliber.  Wants to hold A&O to the general guidelines.  They can achieve their ultimate goal under the current system.
	•	Questions
	•	Q: There was a point made earlier that if they had the flexibility to plan these events at the same time, it would save money.  Can you speak to this issue?
	•	A: They’re not asking to take away from the senate amendment pool.  They say that you can get “bigger bang for your buck” if you can start negotiating at the same time.  So according to NU policy, you cannot exceed the allocated budget. 
	•	Motion to extend time 2 minutes
	•	Vote on motion to extend time 2 minutes
	•	Passed
	•	Q: Has the SAFC passed petitions on short notice in the past?
	•	A: Yes, the minimum is 12 hours.
	•	Q: Do you agree with the concept that we would be able to get better speakers
	•	A: Having never been on the programming side, don’t know how much time is how much money.  But thinks that given the early funding happening now, and the speed of the petition, they can reach their goal.
	•	Motion to extend for 1 minute
	•	Vote on motion to extend question period for 1 minute
	•	Passed
	•	A: A&O’s goal was to send out 2 offers at the same time.  But they can petition to do that.
	•	Pro Speech: Just asking for a pretty simple change.  We’ve brought in 2 comedians in years past.  But basically we just want to do the same thing that we’ve done in the past, but with a little more flexibility and a little more cost-efficient.  We don’t think that we will be able to effectively work within the current title.  It doesn’t occur any additional risk, it doesn’t reduce oversight, but it will benefit students in that it will be more cost-efficient.  Believes that the incentive structure will be the same.
	•	Question
	•	Q: Just to clarify, if this passed now you would be able to start booking comedians now?  Whereas under the current system you would have to wait until winter quarter?
	•	A: Yes—if this passed we would be able to start negotiations immediately.  In the past we have had to wait until the first event has passed in order to start planning their second.
	•	Point of information: They can start to plan their event immediately under the current system:  but the SAFC wants to have a clear delineation between the speaker’s funding. 
	•	Motion to extend by 2 minutes
	•	Vote to extend by 2 minutes
	•	Passed
	•	Questions
	•	Q: A&O has a long track record of bringing great speakers, why can’t you just divide the line items?
	•	A: Splitting it into two would not be as effective.  This limits some of the flexibility in negotiations.
	•	Q: You say that caliber is measured by attendance?
	•	A: That is part of the caliber measurement.
	•	Motion to extend for remainder of the question
	•	Vote extend for remainder of the question
	•	Passed 
	•	A: Measuring the caliber is complicated—it is not necessarily only measured by attendance.
	•	Con Speech: The main problem with the petition is that we cannot treat A&O any different than any student groups.  All that is gained by this appeal is a loss of accountability.  Believes that there wouldn’t really be a gain in flexibility.  And a petition can be passed within 12 hours.  We want to stick to the guidelines that have been established in order to keep the best interests of the students in mind.  The SAFC really just wants a delineation of spending.
	•	Q: Are you saying that the SAFC would be willing to accept a petition before tickets were sold?
	•	A: We need to have delineation of speakers.
	•	Vote to change winter comedian to winter comedian series
	•	Passed
	•	College Democrats
	•	Motion to add $1000 honorarium
	•	Seconded
	•	Pro Speech: We’re asking for extra $1000 for winter honorarium.  Believe that due to the caliber of the events that we’ve hosted, an increase is merited
	•	Con Speech: Reasons cited in recommendations were really about specifics.
	•	Pro Speech: None
	•	Vote to allocate $1000 to College Democrats

	•	Vote
	•	Passed
	•	Old Business: SL 1011-02 Developing our Deliberate Assembly
	•	Introduction: Basically we’ve been using three kinds of rules during senate meetings.
	•	Q: What is the ultimate purpose of this?
	•	A: To make senate more efficient.  To develop consistency.
	•	Q: About the action clause… 
	•	A: Just for “in-senate elections”
	•	Motion to amend that in the action clause, stated “within in-senate elections”
	•	Motion rescinded
	•	Vote to pass SL 1011-02
