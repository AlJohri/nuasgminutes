Meeting of the Senate
January, 7, 2014

	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	General Order: Wild Ideas PR Rush
	•	Andrew: We would really love for more people to apply for Wild Ideas. If you could tweet out or post a status of the application link (bit.ly/nuwildideas) If you represent a student group, then let them know! It’s a great way to try out a new event. 
	•	General Order: ABTS Volunteers (sign up form)
	•	Chris: Erik talked a bit about ABTS. First check out Kevin or my exec board report for more details. Next week we have Big Ten representatives coming, so we need volunteers to help out. We only need about 4-6 volunteers and it will only be a few hours unless you’re interested in more. Maybe be a bus captain or checking people into the hotel. It’ll be pretty fun so please sign up!
	•	General Order: Student Life Committee Focus: University Committees 
	•	Chris: Just because we have a little bit of time, I want to take a few minutes to tell you about what Student Life does and where we represent students on official committees. Our job is to provide the student perspective to administrators and faculty, which is a difficult job. I’d love for you to reach out to me if you’re interested in any of these committees and I can bring you along. It is an opportunity for our committee to get more of a perspective.
	•	SL1415-09: Accessibility: Updating Vocabulary
	•	Austin: Basically what I want to present are some updates to the committee. We spent a lot of time reflecting internally about our mission and vision statement, which you can read in the legislation. We realized there was a bit of a disconnect, especially with the word diversity. We need to make sure that the community is accessible and inclusive and in that way it can be more diverse. There are three things. The first is a code change, just switching out “Accessibility” for “Diversity.” We are still trying to foster diversity, but it makes more sense to do that through accessibility. The second and third parts are just about logistics: changing my email and changing the PR plan. Once this legislation passes, all future communication would include the new name. We are trying to do that within the next year. It’s not drastic, but just trying to make sure we’re aligning to our vision and mission.

	•	Confirmed unanimously. 
	•	General Order: Parliamentarian Election

	•	no objections.
	•	General Order: Election Commission Elections
	•	Noah: The Election Commission’s main job is to see over the campus elections. Your first responsibility is to elect an Election Commissioner who is the chair of the Election Commission. After that you are in charge of revising the Election Guidelines. During the election period, you oversee the election. 
	•	Lauren: Are we electing all seven people? 
	•	Noah: What happened last year is we elected everyone and then some people stepped down and we elected new people again. 
	•	Isaac: I’d like to nominate Dana and Jake.

	•	Faheem: I decline. 
	•	Grace: I nominate Olivia. 
	•	Olivia: I accept. 
	•	Alec: I nominate myself!
	•	Dana: I’m dana. I’m the parliamentarian (not a conflict of interest!) I was the election commissioner last year, and before that i was on the commission. At this point i’m pretty much ready for anything. 
	•	Jake: I’m jake,im good under pressure because theater and auditions and shit like that. I’m a freshman and dont know many people who are running, so it’s easier for me to be impartial.
	•	Nehaarika: I’m on rules right now, i’m a fan fo the code.
	•	Matt: I’m a sophomore, first year on asg. it’s time for me to get more involved. I think it’s important to take an interest in the elections and making sure they are run well. I’m an RA this year, i’ve had to balance a lot of interests this year. [giants fan nonsense]
	•	OLauren: i am good under pressure. 
	•	oliviia: i’m a freshman,very new to this. i like to think im decent under pressure.
	•	Alex: this is my second year as a senator, i was on the commisssion last year.
	•	Noah: question
	•	Isaac: Can the election commission do anything to make elections less messy? 
	•	Jake: I have not read the actual policies yet, and would need to do that. from what i have seen of advertising in gheneral, theres a lot of flyers in wasted places where people step and i think we can be more evironmendally frinedly.
	•	Nehaarika: because it’s part of government, i think we can streamline it
	•	Matt: i dont really knw how the election was run
	•	lauren: i think last years was pretty un-messy, and i thnk that was because we shortened the time frime. i thinkthat was good. at the same time, i think we can make some things simpler.
	•	olivia: i haven’t picked up the guidelines yet but i’m sure we can make them simpler. 
	•	alex: i agree with lauren. from my perspective it wasn’t messy
	•	Dana: what do you mean messy?
	•	isaac: messy to the point that bad things occur
	•	Dana: Iv’e been on the commisssion for one contentionus election and one less contentious one. we didn’t have any violations last year and i think that’s because we clealry told every candidate our expecations and made ourselves available to everyone. people don’t want to commmit violations. i like to think of the commisssion as a resource. when i was on the commission, each person was assigned to a campaign.
	•	What’s a creative debate qyestion you’d want to ask?
	•	Nehaarika: what are some negative experiences that have led you to better conflict resolution methods?
	•	matt: what is your relation with your running mate and why did you choose him? why are you wearing what you are wearing?
	•	lauren: what is one isssue that has not been in the spotlight this year that you would like to address?
	•	alex: who is your biggest role model?
	•	dana: this isn’t creative either: one problem is that every campaign tries to tackle all issues, so that each campaign looks the same. so my question 
	•	jake: 
	•	motion to white ballot
	•	*seconded*
	•	*aye* (unanimous)

	•	Ethan: HEY EVERYBODY! Worked on various projects over break, including Campus Voice. Website is coming along well, should be launched next week.
	•	Mark: On Sunday at 2pm, we'll have a lot of fun with stickers- applying them to shower heads and CFLs. Please invite all your friends to the event on facebook. Also, if you're interested in helping out on Sunday, it'll count for your PR requirement and it'd be much appreciated.

	•	General Order: CampusVoice Launch
	•	Brad: CampusVoice has been a long time coming, but we're live. Check it out! You can log in with your netID- students can report problems or suggestions. There's some content there- you can also add polls to suggestions. Hoping to minimize spamming by requiring people to post comment if they give a submission a "thumbs down."
	•	Ian: Why is Wildcat Connection not on the top bar
	•	Brad: Technically not our service, it's a CSI service
	•	Ethan: We'll be integrating data from wildcat connection going forward
	•	Becca: We'll be placing ourselves around campus with the "speech bubble" board and asking people how we can improve campus. We'll then take pictures and upload their suggestions. Please sign up for some times.
	•	Ani: PR requirement is really a requirement this quarter! We'll be more closely regulating this this quarter.
	•	General Order: Residential Conditions Working Group Update
	•	Harrison: We're a group that has been looking at the various residential colleges/halls and working with Paul Riehl to improve living conditions- we've toured two residential colleges, plans to tour more, and before we go in we ask residents to submit suggestions for improvement. We look out for those things, report them to Paul, and really improvements are happening.
	•	Chris: The process of doing this is three-fold- send out a survey, compile the results and looking at those suggestions when touring the dorm. We did Elder first- Paul is very gung-ho. We had 85 people respond to the survey, figured out 5-6 things to be done in short term and 5-6 things for long term. Paul reported back to us and told us most of the improvements would be done. Fixed multiple shower stalls, turned a bike storage area into a study room
	•	Morgan: Started a shower curtain revolution in Kemper, getting study nooks- long term, we're going to put curtains
	•	Ian: Hinman and Jones now have overhead lighting thanks to Paul, among many other improvements.

ASG Senate Minutes
01-16-13

	•	General Order: JiveHealth Presentation
	•	Ani: Want to start off with presentation from Dennis from JiveHealth
	•	Dennis: Please type in the link on the flyer I've provided- we're creating an iPhone game to encourage kids to eat healthier. Many companies have come together to end childhood obesity with this challenge. It's a Facebook voting contest, top 3 go to Washington DC. It'd be great for us and NU
	•	Ani: We'll send the link out by email after Senate as well.
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	Neil: Residential Life Academic Summit- a few other exec members were there, was a discussion of the optimal and ideal picture of what a residential housing system should look like. Was broad forum, let us articulate ideas, no matter how vague.
	•	Also, apply for faculty-student interaction grants! Great opportunity if you're interested.
	•	David: Scheduled the next food truck festival for February 2nd, benefitting Dance Marathon. Connected to DM Top Chef- 15% of proceeds will go to DM.
	•	Book swap is getting revamped- restyling it to get in line with other ASG Services
	•	Cab Share app will be coming in next couple weeks
	•	Shout out to Michael and Chris for spearheading a new collaborative project that creates system to sell
	•	Carly: Lots of responses for Operations Director- look forward to more updates- also meeting with RHA this Tuesday. Also want to welcome Eric Morales and Connor Regan as our two newest  Senators!
	•	David C: Getting things ready for Eva Jefferson Day- is a national day of service. Annually brings in 70 kids to campus- combining this with our day of service. Pick up flyers  at the end of senate to advertise it and please participate
	•	Ethan: HEY EVERYBODY!! The website is not online, campus voice updates distracted me- get your constituents to use it!
	•	Becca: Winter Activities Fair is next week from 1-4, please pick up some flyers for it to distribute to your constituents
	•	Ani: Remember the PR requirement and to give Becca your information so she can note you down as having your PR requirement completed for the quarter
	•	Steven: Housing Fair on February 19th!
	•	Ani: Glad to see an almost full house tonight!
	•	New Business: SL1213-18: Computer Chargers for Rent
	•	Aaron: Hey everyone, I'm Aaron, I was a Senator previously and this is something that I worked on and am working to expand now with this legislation. I've met with Alice, who is head of the Library Circulation desk, and she says the chargers have been a huge success and was a great opportunity to expand resources in the library. Though there has been a success, she let me know that there is demand for more chargers.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian: Can you come back with more numbers/information about the chargers?
	•	Aaron: I have that information- busiest time during Reading/Finals week, can only see how many times it's been used. There's been a huge demand
	•	Motoki: Any expansion toward windows users?
	•	Aaron: Mac chargers give more bang for buck- most accessible to students. Getting chargers for pcs might be the next step
	•	Abby: Have students requested non-mac chargers?
	•	Aaron: Didn't come up in my meeting with library admin, but I can check
	•	Alex: Why are these chargers so expensive?
	•	Aaron: Chargers are $79.99, don't want to buy non-OEM chargers
	•	Ciara: Any data on how many users on campus are mac users?
	•	Ethan: 50% are on Macs, 40% are on Windows, 7% use their iPhones. There definitely seems to be a majority of Mac users.
	•	Ciara: 40% is a lot
	•	Aaron: Agreed, but don't want to use up all of Senate's money and couldn't find better solution.
	•	Sofia: Thinkpad might be more common computer model to buy chargers for.
	•	Senator: How much money is left in the project pool?
	•	David C: around $7,000
	•	Mike: Can't we use late fees to cover the cost of this?
	•	Aaron: Late fees go to a different part of the budget currently, but can't be done at the moment.
	•	Kevin: At what point do we have too many chargers- 6 should cover it, right?
	•	Aaron: there is a point where you max out efficiency- but number in the library can probably reach up to 1,000 people  during reading/final week. Need to be able to evaluate how the chargers are used during such busy periods.
	•	Motoki: Are these only for main library?
	•	Aaron: Again, it's a pilot program, so we think main library gets most usage, might be possible to expand further down the road.
	•	Alex: Can we get ASG stickers on the chargers?
	•	Aaron: Shouldn't be a problem.
	•	Ethan: Point of information- NU Link shows 65% mac usage vs. 32% PC usage
	•	Ani: This is new business, it will be voted on next week as old business.
	•	New Business: SL1213-19: Campaign Reform Ad-hoc Committee
	•	Steven: We've talked a lot about this in Senate, so to avoid more talk in Senate… ad-hoc committee! Basically want to get the people who disagree about this together to talk this over and report back in February.
	•	Mark: Motion to move this old business
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is now old business.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Motoki: How often would this ad-hoc meet?
	•	Steven: Probably no more than once a week- 5 good meetings should be sufficient between now and February.
	•	Mark: Could these changes go into this election cycle?
	•	Brandon: Depending on the size and scope of the changes proposed, possibly.
	•	Mark: We should add stipulations to protect against conflicts of interests.
	•	Steven: No official pairings yet… so can't really do that.
	•	April: What kind of research will be done…?
	•	Steven: Not about the candidates- would look at other schools with similar student governments and would see how they regulate campaigns and how we can improve our model.
	•	Dana: Do you anticipate this committee coming up with new ideas than previous initiatives?
	•	Steven: Yes, I hope so. I may want to push back elections to ensure that those who were against previous proposals can be a part of this. Don't want to waste anymore of Senate's time and help develop something new that does work.
	•	Neil: Who's not here that you'd want on the committee?
	•	Steven: Sarah and Rebecca
	•	Motoki: Is there a need to create an official committee?
	•	Steven: this provides a framework and legitimacy. You can't compel people to show up without this framework- and want to drive home the point that if you have objections about the campaign system and don't participate, your opinion shouldn't be counted.
	•	Harrison: What kind of problems would be tackled?
	•	Steven: No system for regulating campaigns and candidates before the campaign period. These people are meeting with student leaders now, but there's no transparency in this process- it's a very gray area with verbal campaigning. Candidates will make unofficial agreements about the rules of the game before the game. Turns it into a game of talking to stakeholders rather than reaching out to individual students
	•	Senator: Motion to extend question period by 5 minutes
	•	Vote- approved. Question period is extended by 5 minutes.
	•	Mike: Is there any kind of control  to prevent this group from meeting every year when the problems may be solved with this ad-hoc?
	•	Steven: Ad-hoc will end after proposal, won't be standing and won't set a precedent.
	•	Harrison: Why need for change now?
	•	Steven: Came about last year following the election. We all discussed the issues we faced in the campaign, attempts for improvement were shot down, trying to create a framework for real progress. Something has to change.
	•	Paul: Motion to table for one week since we aren't electing people tonight.
	•	Ian: Objection
	•	Ian: Withdrawn
	•	Motoki (question): Do you already have an idea of who you want on this committee?
	•	Steven: There are some people I have in mind and would appreciate joining, but it's up to them
	•	Mike: Would the members be elected a week after it's passed?
	•	Ani: Based on the bill as it's written now, they would be elected immediately.
	•	Henry: Can you ask the Senators if there are 3 who want to run for this right now?
	•	Ani: No, not in line.
	•	Motoki: Objection
	•	Motoki (con): We should pass this this week- no reason to postpone this. Let's just amend it so that elections happen next week.
	•	Henry: I agree, we can just have an election next week and avoid the same questions being asked.
	•	Paul: Motion withdrawn
	•	Henry: Motion to amend the legislation to reflect having the committee members elected next week.
	•	Paul: Motion to previous question on the amendment
	•	Vote- approved. Amendment is passed, committee members will be elected next week.
	•	David: Motion to previous question on the bill
	•	Vote- approved. Legislation is passed unanimously.
	•	Emergency Legislation: Supporting Sensible Gun Control
	•	Steven: Want to present legislation to support Obama's recent executive orders restricting gun control.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	David: What is your opinion on ASG taking a stance on national political issues?
	•	Ian: Not going to answer that.
	•	Nalin: Will anything come of this- what's the point?
	•	Steven: Resolutions don't prescribe action, but meant to be symbolic. Recent mass shootings have become very relevant .
	•	Harrison: Precedent for ASG writing legislation about national issues?
	•	Ani: Yes, there is precedent of such legislation being brought up- notable example is the iron dome missile defense system legislation, which got tabled.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con on hearing the bill.
	•	Jesse (con): Feel comfortable representing issues with the university, but not sure about representing them on political issues.
	•	David: Would advise against seeing this- I may personally agree with this strongly, but I don't know if this in line for us to vote on this as a body as there are people we represent that may feel completely differently.
	•	Steven (pro): Wanted to bring it up as emergency because it is particularly relevant right now. We are student government , we've taken positions on issues like these
	•	Harrison (con): Great discussion to have, but this executive order just came out today, need time to review the implications of this order before discussing it.
	•	Steven (pro): By making this emergency, it opens as new business. Need to look at this while it's still relevant and before student support wanes.
	•	Neil: should look at this now to set us up for a vote next week
	•	Paul: Are you saying that we should vote on it now that people aren't here?! Because that's incredibly underhanded and I think the opposite should be encouraged!
	•	Neil: No, no, I meant the opposite- don't want to vote on this now, just want to bring it up so it's ready for a vote next week
	•	Ani: Even if you misheard the comment, please be respectful.
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- division
	•	Ay- 12
	•	Nay- 18
	•	Abstentions- 7
	•	Vote- fails. Legislation is not heard.
	•	Good of the Order and Announcements
	•	Mark: Showerhead/CFL campaign ending this Friday- get your name in before it's over. Fraternity/Sorority houses will be getting these as well. Will also be bringing resolution next week, look out for that.
	•	David: Look at historical context of ASG looking at issues like that
	•	David: Go to DM trivia, have fun!
	•	Can also submit a block theme!
	•	Ethan: Fill out form to give information for the ASG website
	•	Katie: NCDC having winter volunteer fair in Northwestern Room
	•	Mike: Community Engagement Grant has been receiving submissions- ad-hoc will select these and we'll be having elections for that next Wednesday
	•	Steven: David's not here- should sign up for MLK/Eva Jefferson Day of Service, get to hang out with kids and be a good role model
	•	Ani: Join that selection committee! And Dr. Dunkle, head of CAPS, will be here next week to talk about expanding mental health resources on campus. Think about some questions. Please invite constituents who might be interested in coming

	•	Mark: [Full Transcript] I have five minutes, so I’ll take all of them.

On many occasions I have come to you for support. But today, I ask for your action. Now is the time, as a student government, as a university, and as a nation, to take part in finding a new solution to an enormous challenge.

We have been born into a world that is the product of our ancestors, a world which we will soon inherit, a world for which we have tremendous responsibility. From the battlefields of Normandy to the fights for equality and fairness, with the incalculable sacrifice of our parents and grandparents, our brothers and sisters, we entered this earth with the task unfinished. We have made great progress, but not without great cost. Charlie Chaplin was hauntingly accurate, when he declared in 1940, that the “Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity.” Our measurements of progress, the advancement of technology and our fetish for economic growth, have produced unprecedented and dangerous human and environmental consequences. We have been quick to sacrifice the quality of life for the quantity of wealth.

Global climate change is the greatest challenge our generation faces, and it is indeed the greatest threat that we face as a species. It is a self-inflicted wound, a condition that calls into question the very power of mankind,  the consequences of which will not only lead to the heartbreaking death of thousands of plant and animal species, but also destabilize and augment the many tangible, horrible human tragedies we face every day. Famine and disease, long considered curable, will only intensify as our agricultural systems and disease vectors migrate elsewhere. Our centers of trade and culture alike, our shoreline cities, await rising sea levels that will challenge their existence within our lifetimes. Climate change undermines the very objectives of human progress.

If we are to learn anything from history, it is that economies do not operate in isolation. The collapse of our greatest societies often has deep ecological roots. The 10,000 year experiment of settled life will stand or fall by what we do, and don’t do, now. This transition must be from short-term to long-term thinking, from recklessness and excess to moderation and precaution.

These prospects leave many of my colleagues hopeless, even desperate. In a publication earlier this week, Dr. Harvey Young, an Associate Professor at Northwestern, argued that:

“Rather than appealing to a person's good nature and sense of moral responsibility, the campaign to slow down global warming and bring about climate stability might be better served to appeal to their baser instincts.”

I come before you today not only because the realities of climate change demand our action, but also because there exists a strong economic case for our university to act now, to divest from coal, a killer of well over 13,000 American each year, and to put our assets toward the clean, renewable technologies that Northwestern labs have and will continue to bring to market. And lastly, we must face the reality— that the 20% of our university’s endowment predicated on fossil fuels is no longer sustainable in any sense of the word.

On Monday, President Obama acknowledged that “The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult.  But America cannot resist this transition; we must lead it.”

It was with the same vision that the architects of Northwestern’s strategic plan, the document that is to guide the future of our institution, declared, “we will contribute to the solutions for renewable energy and a sustainable environment and to how public policies and economic incentives promote implementation of new technologies and practices.”

I see no clearer, no more material realization of this mission than the actions we demand here, in this forum. If we are to take seriously the mission at hand, to recognize our duty, not just as students, but as citizens of the world, we must acknowledge the timeless words of Albert Camus, “Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does.”

We did not create this world, as students we are barely responsible for its degradation and destruction, but we hold the power to influence it. Our actions alone may not reverse the damage done, but will be a powerful example to our peers and the world alike. I ask you to join me, not only because it is in our best interest, but also because it is right. Three months before his assassination, Senator Robert F. Kennedy spoke to a small crowd at the University of Kansas:

“We cannot measure national spirit by the Dow Jones Average, nor national achievement by the Gross National Product. For the Gross National Product includes air pollution… the destruction of the redwoods, it does not allow for the health of our families, the quality of their education, or the joy of their play. It is indifferent to the decency of our factories and the safety of our streets alike. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile, and it can tell us everything about America -- except whether we are proud to be Americans."

We stand at a precipice, as a university, and as a country. Our leaders will act, and we must too. Let us work together, as Americans and world citizens, to bring new prosperity to our national economy, and to bring security and safety to the world.
	•	Ani: Moving into question period.
	•	David: You detail this in the bill, but can you elaborate on why students should be lobbying for divestment?
	•	Mark: This is one step to the top, designed to work in tandem with a faculty senate resolution. Other institutions have taken this route.
	•	David: Were they successful?
	•	Mark: Smaller ones were successful, larger ones are still pending. Need to get ultimate approval from Board of Trustees, but it's all going forward
	•	Dana: Can you talk about the 2005 divestment movement?
	•	Mark: Decision came to end Sudan support- we've done it before and we can do it again
	•	Mark: I'd like to introduce those I'm working with one these projects- NU responsible endowment coalition.
	•	Patrick: Are you sure that we can divest completely without harming the university?
	•	Mark: no, but coal is nonsense, it's not a profitable investment. It's clear that this is a dying industry
	•	Rebecca: Are there time constraints to passing this, or can we wait a week?
	•	Mark: the quicker we can pass this the better- passing this will make it easier going forward talking with faculty who don't think it's their place to be supporting this.
	•	Patrick: Divestment in other energies?
	•	Mark: Starting with coal- 20% of our endowment is in coal/oil/gas.
	•	Jesse: Isn't this implying you know more about endowment than NU administration?
	•	Mark: This is just what we gleaned from our talks with NU admin.
	•	Jesse: Why did they think coal wasn't a good investment and why are they still investing in it
	•	Mark: these are people who want to diversify their portfolio- if there can be a huge PR situation, it'd be a big push for the administration to change
	•	Jesse: You're saying it's an investment of low priority?
	•	Mark: It's not even up to market conditions.
	•	Jesse: What I don't understand is that if they thought it was a bad investment and they want to get rid of it, why would they wait for PR against it
	•	Mark: this is a game theory issue- there's an expectation in the marketplace that maybe it'll catch up to market expectations. These expectations affect the willingness to diversify. Market price doesn't align with actual payoffs
	•	Paul: Motion to move this legislation to old business
	•	Rebecca: Objection
	•	Paul: We can leave until next Senate, but don't feel that there's much opposition in the room, especially considering there's some time sensitivity.
	•	Ani: Moving to pro/con on moving to old business
	•	Rebecca (con): I agree with this, but haven't been able to talk to everyone in my organization, and I don't think you all have had a chance to talk to all your constituents. Although you know what you think, doesn't mean everyone believes as you do.
	•	Ian (pro): Not easiest thing in the world to garner support from faculty Senate since they're so involved. Once it's old business, we can discuss further and answer questions to make things clearer.
	•	Rebecca (con): I really feel uncomfortable about this- you should think about what your constituents believe- it will pass next week, but since the meeting isn't until beginning of February, we should wait.
	•	Mike (point of information): Is there a date we need it to be submitted by?
	•	Mark: No specific date, but the sooner it gets introduced, the better. Rebecca raises a good point, I will revise my position to ambivalence. You guys can make the right decision. 
	•	Person: Faculty Senate is on February 5, but agenda has to be set five days in advance
	•	Mark: Strike everything I just said.
	•	Ian: Motion to move this to old business
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is now old business.
	•	Jesse: Motion to strike all clauses about performance benefits.
	•	Jesse: By saying that it's a bad investment, we're implying that we have more knowledge about how the endowment should be invested than the investors managing the endowment. We have to assume they know better than we do how to allocate the money
	•	Ian H (point of personal privilege (but not really)): I suggest my honorable friend retracts his amendment
	•	Ani: Not in line.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con on the amendment
	•	Mark (con): I understand your concerns, but I disagree. This legislation is  a recommendation based on market trends, not specifically with our endowment. As far as being presumptive- they have no reason to believe things will change, they need some sort of push on this. The economic reasons are there, the resolution speaks for itself
	•	Jesse (pro): If the people who run the endowment are telling us it's a bad investment, it makes no sense that the money wouldn't have been taken out already. It will look silly to the investors managing Northwestern's account if we take this approach.
	•	David (pro): I agree with the legislation in substance, but also think it's presumptuous to say that we know better than NU investors. We won't win the argument this way, it's better to endorse the more ethical route.
	•	Ian (point of information): what passages to strike exactly?
	•	Ani: Can you figure that out Jesse?
	•	Mike (con): Nowhere does it say explicitly that we know better than NU investors, and Mark's research looks very solid. It's a suggestion for how the endowment can shift it's passage. Even if we are saying we know better, what's the harm?
	•	Ian: We're striking facts- the DOW index has gone up and down in the last decade- nothing in that clause saying it's a bad investment.
	•	Jesse: [Details what lines he wants to strike]
	•	Patrick (pro): The statements in question are not facts at all
	•	Jesse: Mark's speech was more opinionated than bill itself and now that I'm reading the bill, I'll concede that the bill isn't outright saying we know better than investors. But still, we shouldn't have lines about Indexes in our bills, not everyone is versed on this industry
	•	Mark (con): Authorship speeches are meant to be more candid, I encourage you to read the legislation and see for yourself if it makes these claims.
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote on the amendment
	•	Rebecca: Motion to suspend rules and table to next week
	•	Ani: Not in line, we're moving to a vote on the amendment
	•	Rebecca: But I suspended the rules!
	•	Vote- fails. Amendment is defeated
	•	Rebecca: Motion to table for a week
	•	Rebecca: I'm disappointed when these past 5-10 minutes show that while we generally agree with the idea of this legislation, there are points that clearly need to be revised and discussed with our constituents. Think about this, there's controversy surrounding this.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Abby (con): I feel like this would be supported by most constituents, but they did do a good job collecting 55 constituents reaching all parts of campus
	•	Mike (con): We don't have the liberty to wait on this
	•	Steven (con): There's a distinction between representatives and delegates- with initiatives overwhelmingly supported, representatives should be comfortable voting for their constituents.
	•	Jesse (pro): Given the economic discussion about endowment, we should wait a week to discuss this- before we suggest the endowment should reinvest in something, we should do further research
	•	Rebecca (pro): Would like to pass this unanimously to show support- but I worry my constituents don't agree with it. I want to convince them so that we can vote unanimously
	•	David (pro): I'm a sponsor on this bill, but there's a lot of information and nuance here that needs to be discussed. It's important that people take the time to think through things like this.
	•	Mark (con): Rebecca raises good points- I'm willing to table this for a week if you all agree to actually go out and talk to people on campus, email me with questions, dispute our economics.
	•	David: Motion to previous question on tabling for one week
	•	Vote- passed. This bill is tabled for one week.
	•	New Business: SR1213-07: Gun Control Resolution
	•	Steven: We have done this on a political issue in the past- we convinced the university to reevaluate student protest rights in the past. This is a political act from a political body- nothing in the code limits us from talking about this and it's important that we do talk about it. This hits home for me from my home state, where there was a shooting at my old high school just in the past week. There's no statement of democrats or republicans, just a support for Obama's call for action. Coordinated student action is powerful, and if we deny ourselves to talk about political issues, it will not bode well for our organization and campus. We should not discourage our students from voicing their opinions on these issues. Some may argue that gun violence may not affect our campus, but we can't think short term, we can't think about the here and now and the immediate, we also need to think about the future and being on the right side of history.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Harrison: Where did you get sources for be it resolved statement?
	•	Steven: Can amend language of this bill
	•	Ani: This will be old business next week.
	•	New Business: SR1213-08: Political and Partisan Issues
	•	Rebecca: ASG has talked a lot about diversity- missing from these discussions is political diversity. You should consider that there are political majorities and minorities on campus. The mission of ASG is to connect students, and understand that this more so works to divide them. The goal of this is not to prevent free speech, but not to press opinions on other people. It's is not our responsibility to impress our beliefs on other students. Remember that political diversity exists and this resolution exists to prevent a political minority from being ostracized.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Dana: How do you draw the distinction between political vs. partisan issues? 
	•	Rebecca: Difficult to draw line, will leave it up to the Senate to decide exactly what issues are tackled.
	•	Sarah: Do you think that the break-up senate accurately represents how students feel politically?
	•	Rebecca: Yes. As a liberal institution, most people here are probably liberal as well. The fact that this would offend a minority would affect students in a unique way
	•	Ian: Political identity vs. political opinion
	•	Rebecca: There's definitely a distinction.
	•	Mark: I understand your reasoning, but don't understand how we're overpowering someone's opinion?
	•	Rebecca: By passing endorsements of national policies, we're neglecting the possibility that other
	•	Person: Religious diversity vs. political diversity
	•	Rebecca: It exists
	•	Sarah: How do you feel that this differs from other resolutions- with most resolutions we state what the Northwestern student body believes.
	•	Rebecca: The reason we have a political process that uses majority rules is to circumvent going from person to person and reach decisions in an expedient matter. When you make decisions for the majority, it's meant to reflect majority opinion, no need to use this system for things like this.
	•	Hannah: Does this reference Steven's bill more so?
	•	Rebecca: Want to make general statement on ASG's ability to comment on political issues.
	•	Paul: Motion to extend question period by 5 minutes.
	•	Vote- passed. Question period is extended.
	•	Ani: Further questions?
	•	Steven: Any correlations to the group's views and the subject matter of the resolution ?
	•	Dane: Wouldn't support ASG making endorsements, but wants to argue matter of precedent by saying that ASG doesn't have a place in discussing such issues
	•	Carly: Interested to know why you think these national issues don't affect students?
	•	Dane: They do affect Northwestern, however, ASG choosing to support something doesn't affect any policies at Northwestern and makes no tangible change.
	•	Rebecca: ASG tabled a resolution 2 years ago supporting Israel
	•	Steven: Why was it tabled?
	•	Ani: Wasn't clear why we should inject ourselves into a binary debate and get stuck in that issue.
	•	Alex (point of information): Doesn't the fact that we tabled the Israel legislation mean we didn't take an opinion?
	•	Victor: Motion to extend question period by 2 minutes.
	•	Vote- passed. Question period is extended.
	•	Ani: More questions?
	•	Sarah: My question is language specific- do you think there's a distinction between supporting a law and supporting looking more into a situation
	•	Dane:: We'll disagree that, regardless of the specific policy- it should come down to whether or not it affects the lives of students
	•	Person: It's direct impact vs. indirect impact
	•	Victor: Would a resolution get to floor being debated on how it should be heard?
	•	Dane: Ideal structure would be to look if legislation has direct impact or not on students and judge that primarily when deciding to discuss it.
	•	Steven: If it affected someone at the university, would it become relevant?
	•	Dane: Gun control affects everyone here- but endorsing Obama's action would affect nothing.
	•	Sofia: What would register as something relevant to the student body?
	•	Dane: If the policy proposal was to increase security guard presence, that has impact, but more political issues are macroscopic policies issues out of our purview
	•	Rebecca: Gender neutral bathrooms are a good example of this- sought to change policy here, rather than on a national level.
	•	New Business: SL1213-20: Student Groups Vice President & Financial Vice President Selection Committees
	•	Victor: This legislation is to change up the code a bit about the selection of the SGVP and FVP. Wanted to combine these two. Given that we have a Chief of Staff, we thought that she should be a co-chair on this selection committee, along with the SGVP. Girish and Lauren are in support of this, would make process more efficient and ensure those who have the relevant expertise to determine who would make a good candidate
	•	Motoki: Why does the FVP changes only prescribe that a Senator has to be on the committee
	•	Victor: SAFC code more strict than SGC code.
	•	Ani: Equal number of senator/non-senators on SAFC, not so with SGC
	•	Tori: How to differentiate who is the most senior member when members join at the same time?
	•	Victor: Not sure of precedent
	•	Ani: Generally decided by the chairs
	•	New Business: SL1213-21: Ad-Hoc Committee on Gun Control
	•	Ian: this arose during Rules when I pointed out that there can't be an establishment of an ad-hoc in a resolution. Same principle, would create an ad hoc to take our stance and work with other universities to develop a response to collegiate gun control.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Alex: Exactly what members of Congress would be contacted? Like, all of them?
	•	Ian: Wouldn't send to every member of congress, would be fine with amending to say we'd send it to pertinent Senators
	•	Special Order: Financial Vice President Application Release
	•	Ani: Financial Vice President application is live, link to it in agenda. Due at noon on february 9th
	•	Good of the Order and Announcements
	•	Mike: Part of emerging Arts club- will give out painting supplies to people who need to de-stress (Arts in the community)
	•	April: Harambe- kick off of black history month
	•	David: NU playing Minnesota, won't say the score because it jinxed us last time I did.
	•	Chris: Community engagement grant coming up to be due, please submit more ideas and encourage everyone to submit more ideas
	•	Sofia: McSA Big fall winter speaker, inaugurating a global era, panel of 4 speakers, one a director of security council for Afghanistan, Pakistan
	•	Mark: please reach out to those who want to give input for the legislation
	•	Victor: Veterans Panel tomorrow in Big 10 room; tomorrow at 6pm is MLK keynote; buy a cats care t-shirt; Saturday, February 2nd, having a yoga session in collaboration w/ red cross.
	•	Carly: It’s Dave Richards birthday!

I. Executive Board Reports
	•	Victor: JPK coming into ASG exec on Sunday to talk about various projects
	•	Brad: NU Night at the United Center Update- Bulls set ticket price of $55 a ticket. Given that Derrick Rose's return is impending, they won't give us lower price. Still working with the Bulls, but generally doesn't think that using $20,000 of student groups money would be advisable to spend when students would still have to pay $30 to $40 dollars. Also, I put some cool submissions to Campus Voice in my exec board report- check it out.
	•	Rebecca (question): Can we just go ourselves? Like just ASG?
	•	David H: Who studied abroad in the fall? You should've gotten an email from the study abroad office. We need student support to make the site a success.
	•	Mark (question): Reason for using word doc?
	•	David: Tried various things, wanted something people could download and take their time with. Figured it'd be easier on both sides.
	•	David: Also, Food Truck festival coming up, some proceeds donated to DM. Look at my report for more updates
	•	Carly: Operations is live! Had a frustrating meeting with RHA and will be collaborating with ResLife and CAs in the future for dorm elections and Senator replacements. Want to recognize Dorm Conditions Working group members as the Senators of the week!
	•	Alex: New Norris executive Director started on Monday- working with her and JPK to set up Norris Advisory Committee. Also working with the Center for Civic Engagement to get more students into Chicago. Also meeting with Red Watch Band program with Alcohol Policy Working Group. Finally, just working on showing appreciation for our janitorial staff .

	•	Gio: Hi- I'm replacing John as MGC Senator
 
II. Special Order: Presentation from Dr. John H. Dunkle, Executive Director, Counseling and Psychological Services
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Alex Lower: You said there's been an increase in severity and number of visits- why?
	•	Dunkle: Multiple causes- mass tragedies, economy- there's certainly a ripple effect from events like this.
	•	David H: how can student government help with outreach or support of these goals?
	•	Dunkle: Great to be able to come here and present an update- also great to be working with student government on other avenues. Also helped push for mental health essential NU.
III. General Order: SAFC Investigations
	•	Girish: We sometimes do investigations of groups that violate SAFC guidelines. We go to the group and see if they broke any rules, bring it to Senate and SAFC and see if there are grounds to hold an investigation.
	•	AATE
	•	NPHC Fall Mixer Event- money wasn't used for the event for two years

	•	Girish: Mainly just want to make you all aware that an investigation is happening and to look out for developments on this.
IV. General Order: Financial & Student Groups Vice Presidents Application Release
	•	Ani: Applications for Girish and Lauren's positions are available. Those applications are in the agenda and in emails I've sent out. These positions require a lot of time and work.
	•	Lauren: Girish and I's positions are appointed. We filled out an application- it's very long and time intensive, like the position. Following submission, you interview with ASG members. If you're interested in applying, I'd love to hear from you. What the SGVP does is oversee the Student Groups Committee, which oversees B and T status groups on campus. My role also includes planning a few large events like the Activities Fairs and working in tangent with Girish for Spring Leadership Training. My position is really hard, but you get to meet some really cool student group leaders and work with them on a daily basis. Really rewarding. Apps due on the 9th.
	•	Girish: A lot of the same of what Lauren described. Lauren's position is focused on building up groups and sustaining them, my committee deals with making sure groups utilize the funding we provide them and keeping them going. Feel free to ask us questions after Senate or to email us
	•	Victor: Why do A-status groups receive so much more money?
	•	Girish: Groups that have been around and been successful with large programming consistency
	•	Brad: Reach out to me if you want to run for any exec board position if you haven't already contacted the current holder of the position
V. General Order: Senator Profile Form
	•	Ani: We're building the ASG website, need your information for this, so please fill it out for Ethan.
VI. New Business: SR1213-09: Brady Scholars Senior Project: Hoop House
	•	Maeve: I'm a Senior in the Brady Scholars Program- it's a three year program where we study philosophy and then culminate in a project to address some injustice in the community.
	•	Ummul: We were divided into three groups in our class with each one proposing a project and ultimately voting on one to pursue. We spent most of junior year abroad and looking for organizations on the West side of Evanston to partner with. We decided to partner with New Leaf Urban Gardens which creates greenhouses to address economic marginalization. Right now, we want to help them expand their market and the lands they have to grow- building a hoop house on Northwestern's campus would create a partnership to have fresh produce sold to Sodexho and help provide more jobs to Evanston. We've been meeting with various administrators to work out logistics and see where such a structure could be built on campus. Looking at two different locations, including near Plex, or near Norris
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian: Where do you think it will go up?
	•	Maeve: Either Plex lawn or at Norris in conjunction with WildRoots.
	•	Michelle: How do you see fruits provided here helping?
	•	Ummul: NULG would be able to hire more people and make a higher profit to support the workers it's hiring.
	•	Lauren: Timeline for getting everything built/done?
	•	Maeve: By this Spring hopefully- shouldn't be too hard, most of the work lies in making sure it's sustainable after we graduate
	•	Petros: How large is it and how can you make sure it won't get vandalized?
	•	Should be 20 x 60 feet, and we should have staff from NLUG  to hopefully prevent vandalism.
	•	Patrick: How much annual revenue do you expect?
	•	Ummul: Still working that out, it's very based on how much they can grow and exactly what is grown. They grew like 20 tons of tomatoes before...
	•	Patrick: I come from a family of tomato farmers (no joke), and that seems like a lot of tomatoes.
	•	Ummul: We're working with Brady Scholar grad students who are working out more logistics related to this.
	•	Ani: This is new business, we'll vote on it as old business next week.
	•	Steven: Motion to bump up SR1213-08 to the top of the agenda, since it affects other legislation on the docket.
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is moved to the top of the agenda.
VII. Old Business: SR1213-08: Political and Partisan Issues
	•	Rebecca: You know this legislation and probably how you're going to vote on it already. I think this legislation is important and it's important to think about as we make decisions and how we conduct ourselves as Senators representing our constituents
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Petros: Who gets to decide what is and isn't related to students?
	•	Rebecca: You all do- when a piece of resolution comes up that touches on a touchy topic, this resolution states you need to take a step back and think about if your marginalizing part of the community.
	•	Brad (Point of Information): Resolutions are binding, just don't advocate action.
	•	Ian: Is a code change in order to address this?
	•	Rebecca: Something to look at in the future, but this can certainly exist without a code change
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con on the legislation.
	•	Ian (con): I think based on what the author is saying on the legislation, it's saying we should take a step back and look if we be seeing it. This does nothing- we need a code change for any real change. By passing a resolution that we hold ourselves to a certain standard is circular and complicates things for Senators down the road.
	•	Mike (con): This resolution is great and reminds us that we a re diverse group of students. We all represent the students, but at the same time, it's ambiguous in it's scope and could complicate simple issues down the road. We should trash this and consider each resolution on a case by case basis. Every time we pass a resolution, there will be people against it and we just have to deal with this
	•	Harrison: Motion to table this legislation for three weeks.
	•	Senators: Multiple objections
	•	Harrison: I'm an author on this bill, you can probably guess that there's a reason I want to table it for a time instead of for forever . This bill can go somewhere if we think about it more deeply- it's clearly an issue on campus. Three weeks would give us time to rehash through this and provide a better piece of legislation that reflects what students want.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Steven: Are there any potential amendments that could be brought to the table tonight?
	•	Harrison: haven't thought through a lot of amendments and wasn't sure how this bill would be perceived. Now I see how it is perceived- we want to work on this.
	•	Mike: Question respectfully withdrawn
	•	Mark: Can you elaborate further on the relevance of the Daily Northwestern poll?
	•	Harrison: You can look at it now, it represents a roughly 5% sample of the Northwestern student body. Half the student body supports that ASG shouldn't be taking action on this
	•	Katie: This is just in reference to the gun control issue- not necessarily all political and partisan issues
	•	Harrison: We still have a very sizable amount of student population against action like this- enough to take a look again.
	•	McKenzie: Will you conduct further surveys to get a more accurate portrayal of campus opinion?
	•	Harrison: Definitely something we'll look into to get amore accurate picture of .
	•	Brad (point of information): 380 out of 8000 would be a statistically relevant sample, but this isn't a random sample.
	•	Petros: Do you believe that the leading questions doesn't inform the answer and if the question was asked differently it'd provide the same result?
	•	Harrison: Can't know, need time to do research like this- if we find out that we're wrong we can stop action on this.
	•	Motoki: Motion to previous question
	•	Dana: Objection
	•	Motoki: Withdrawn
	•	Steven: Would you be open to having a bit of debate before voting on whether or not to table?
	•	Harrison: Absolutely
	•	Dana: Why would a 3 week holding period be helpful?
	•	Harrison: 3 weeks would be ideal, anything less is too short, anything more would be too long. Just think there's reason to believe this bill can be improved and need time to look at it.
	•	Rebecca: Can you explain the apple analogy again?
	•	Ian (point of privilege): Needlessly insulting
	•	Harrison: Meant to distinguish between national issues and issues that affect us, and can't determine the point where issues do affect us.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con on tabling this
	•	Mike (con): I am completely against tabling this because at the core, this legislation is censorship. It's wrong, it's bad. We represent the student body and should be able to decide on a case by case basis on what should be heard. Makes Senators second guess themselves when they want to bring up resolutions about international issues. This discussion is important and this is just a political attempt to respond to the gun control.
	•	Motoki: Motion to previous question
	•	Harrison: Objection
	•	Motoki: This is a huge waste of time, my motion is also a waste of time, but come on guys, it's not a matter of how many weeks we need to table, it's not that big of a deal.
	•	Harrison: The building I represent wonders what the purpose of ASG is. I think one of the things we should be addressing as part of ASG is answering the concerns of the student body.
	•	Steven: I agree for a completely different reason, we should continue to talk about this and get some resolution on this issue before moving to a vote.
	•	Ani: Moving into a vote on whether or not to move to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. Moving to previous question.
	•	Ani: Moving into a vote on tabling this bill for three weeks
	•	Vote- fails. Legislation is not tabled for three weeks.
	•	Rebecca: Motion to table indefinitely.
	•	Mike (point of parliamentary procedure): So does this still like float around?
	•	Ani: Yes- it's in legislative purgatory.
	•	Ian: Objection
	•	Rebecca: Personally, I don't see this bill as censorship-y. Striking down this bill wouldn't send the right message, tabling this will send the message that we just don't want to talk about this right now
	•	Ani: Moving to pro/con
	•	Ian (con): The very heart and soul of this bill is so bad that we should reject it since it isn't a good bill. We can't let this go unrejected through senate
	•	Patrick (con): If we table, it doesn't mean that we disagree, it just means we don't agree with the bill as presented
	•	Motoki (pro): By voting on this bill and saying no to what it's saying, you're setting precedent that it's ok to restrict things that affect Northwestern's campus. Let's just vote on it, let's stop wasting time
	•	Motoki: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- division
	•	Ay- 14
	•	Nay- 18
	•	Abstentions- 5
	•	Motion to table indefinitely fails.
	•	Harrison: Motion to previous question
	•	Ian: Objection
	•	Harrison: We all agree that the bill in it's current form isn't something that should be passed
	•	Ian: Objection withdrawn, motion to move to vote.
	•	Vote- fails. Legislation is not passed.
VIII. Old Business: SR1213-06: Implementing the Northwestern Strategic Plan: Establishing Northwestern as a Global Leader in Environmental and Financial Sustainability
	•	Mark: Let's just go to questions.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Rebecca: Have you thought about if this will affect tuition at all?
	•	Mark: Read an article this morning that came out in the Chronicle for Higher Education on this topic- this type of movement will not affect endowments. I'm happy to forward those references to anyone who wants them.
	•	Dana: How many sponsors?
	•	Mark: Probably around 70 now
	•	Michelle: Have you talked to anyone who has not supported this in the administration?
	•	Mark: Not yet.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con.
	•	Ian: Motion to address the amendments to the bill outlined in the agenda.
	•	Mark: First clause to be removed refers to technicality not relevant to this resolution. The second clause
	•	Mike: By including the other clause, it could provide hurdles going forward since those who made these statements chose not to have their names on this. It's just best to strike it since it could entertain a lot of additional questions.
	•	Rebecca: Motion to previous question on the amendments.
	•	Vote-passed. Amendments are stricken.
	•	Jesse: Motion to strike clause "Whereas, the market performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Coal Index has proven to be volatile but ultimately stagnant over the past decade;"
	•	Parliamentary Body: Asked and answered last week.
	•	Jesse (con):  Clause should've been changed.
	•	Rebecca: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is approved.
IX. Old Business: SR1213-07: Gun Control Resolution
	•	Steven: Spoke about this last time, nothing as really changed. We are willing to strike language supporting the President since it could be interpreted as partisan, but the overarching belief of the bill is that intransience isn't acceptable on this issue. This isn't the first time student government has dealt with issues of this nature- when the debt ceiling debate came up, students at multiple universities voiced support that intransience isn't acceptable and it's our futures on the line. We are open to amendment that doesn't change the purpose of the bill.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Motoki: Thoughts on the last whereas statements?
	•	Steven: Wanted to address and compromise with those raising objections.  Our MLK speaker specifically referenced that students and student government should raise up about issues like gun control. Without issues like this, we might as well dissolve Senate.
	•	Jane: Motion to amend the be it resolved statement to remove the line "supports the President’s issuance of executive orders regarding improved gun regulations and"
	•	Jane: Went back to my constituents and talked to them about it, but constituents had problem with perceived partisan support
	•	Michelle: Motion to amend the amendment to add in "supports improved gun regulations and"
	•	Michelle: I agree with everything Jane says, just good to state that we support improved regulations
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question on the amendment of the amendment
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Amendment is amended from "supports the President’s issuance of executive orders regarding improved gun regulations and" to "supports improved gun regulations and"
	•	Rebecca: Motion to previous question
	•	Ian: Objection
	•	Rebecca: Withdrawn
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Ian (con): This amendment castrates a lot of the bills force. Would not like to see this removed from the bill, many members of our caucus would like to see this left in.
	•	Rebecca (pro): This amendment is important- there's evidence for every side, by stating that something is correct doesn't mean it is a fact
	•	Brad (pro): I think this makes the bill more accessible to the student body and makes the bill something everyone can get behind as a relevant issue for our campus.
	•	Ian (con): The wording is already careful enough to not suggest anything is right or wrong, just wants to voice support through executive orders and that the conversation has been started through the executive order's issuance.
	•	Jane (pro): I respectfully disagree with you, Ian. My constituents have stated to me that this wordage supports the President.
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote on the amendment
	•	Vote- division
	•	Ay- ~33
	•	Nay- 4
	•	Abstentions- 0
	•	Motoki: Motion to strike the last seven whereas clauses of the legislation.
	•	No second, motion fails.
	•	Evan: Motion to strike "Northwestern student body" from the final clause and replace with "Associated student Government
	•	Evan: I represent Allison Hall and sent out emails to my constituents, and got mixed responses about the bill. ASG is about facilitating connections between the student body and administrators or other students. Most of my constituents have a right to vote- when a bunch of our constituents may not agree with this, we shouldn't pass this
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian: Why didn't you support the motion to strike several amendments
	•	Evan: If we amend it to say ASG is taking charge of this as opposed to the entire student body, it's more representative
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Paul (con): We're representative, and things we pass speak with the voice of the student body, so striking this doesn't carry as much weight.
	•	Motoki (con) : Changing this would make it an official statement from us.
	•	Chris (pro): We need to be aware of how we make the population of Northwestern feel about the things we pass.
	•	Mike (pro): The wording change is appropriate based on the debate we've had. I do support the bill though.
	•	Petros (con): Think it's wrong to say we should change this based on it being controversial- we always discuss controversial things and if we didn't people would be right in saying ASG doesn't do anything. By striking this, it's redundant and kills a lot of the power of the bill. We should represent the students appropriately.
	•	Steven (con): Historically, student governments have taken up controversial issues- I know this is controversial, but we shouldn't shy away from this, we still represent all students and that should be taken into account
	•	Rebecca (pro): I want to echo what Chris was saying- it does sound better. I love controversial issues, but I'm here for my constituents to debate hardcore issues and then the student body. Since this takes a step away from affecting policy I'd be more comfortable with this wordage
	•	Brad (pro): There's a portion or majority of Northwestern students that would support this, not all of this. In US representative government, this distinction is made.
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote on the amendment.
	•	Vote- division
	•	Ay- 12
	•	Nay- 16
	•	Abstentions- 7
	•	Vote- fails. Amendment is not passed.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question
	•	Senators: Multiple objections
	•	Ian: Withdrawn
	•	Patrick: Motion to previous question
	•	Senators: Multiple objections
	•	Patrick: Withdrawn
	•	Ani: Moving back into pro/con on the resolution
	•	Ian (pro): This is important for our campus, we've discussed this a bit further, we've talked about this.
	•	Mike (pro): We, like many universities, are showing our support for movement on this issue and agree that it's best to take action.
	•	Rebecca (con): We supporting congress for doing their job? My alternative would be to create more groups at Northwestern to support this, rather than just telling Congress to do what it should be doing.
	•	Motoki: Motion to postpone this bill indefinitely
	•	Steven: What?!
	•	Motoki: I feel that this isn't our realm to be discussing. I don't want to say no or yes, postponing indefinitely is the way to go.
	•	Ani: Moving to pro/con
	•	Steven (con): That's why we have abstentions. The discussion on moving to only make it so that ASG is just supporting this, not the student body, avoids the question entirely. Hundreds of colleges support this and we need to stop with the motions designed to derail the conversation we're trying to have!
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- fails. Motion is rejected.
	•	Ani: Back to pro/con
	•	Victor (pro): Want to point out a few things- resolution provides flexibility like the ability to sign onto other agreement. We lobby congress on things like fiscal cliff, we only didn't do that because Senate wasn't meeting while it was relevant
	•	Paul (pro): The fact that Congress has such low approval ratings shows that maybe someone needs to tell them how to do their jobs
	•	Ani: In line for a vote
	•	Vote- passed. Resolution is approved.
X. Old Business: SL1213-20: Student Groups Vice President & Financial Vice President Selection Committees
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian: Why do you think it's important to keep the size of the committee constant while removing Senators?
	•	Victor: Not something we really thought about- for efficiency purposes, we figured there was enough Senate representation.
	•	Girish: We wanted to get more experience on the committee while maintaining Senate voice. Ani brought up the point that the Speaker can serve as a voice for Senate
	•	Lauren (point of information): I was appointed by a similar selection committee as this- not just anarchy.
	•	Victor: Motion to amend- add in lines to ensure that an additional Senator is elected in the case that the individual wishes to run again.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Amendment is included in the bill.
	•	Motoki: When are Senators selected for this
	•	Girish: was thinking of doing this next week
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Rebecca: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Legislation is approved.
XI. Old Business: SL1213-21: Ad-Hoc Committee on Gun Control
	•	Steven: We passed the resolution. Consider it, and then let's pass it.
	•	Rebecca: Motion to amend to change the part where it says "compose an open letter to Congress urging them to work with the Executive branch" to the opposite.
	•	Rebecca: I can't let this go without adding this amendment.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con on the amendment
	•	Ian (con): Aiming the letter at congress is the appropriate place and won't be treated as Presidential fan letter
	•	Steven (con): President has done his part by issuing executive orders- sometimes it's necessary to urge Congress to do their job. They're the ones who need action and that's how government works.
	•	Mark: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- fails. Amendment is defeated.
	•	Brad: Motion to amend the same line to state "to our representatives in the United States government"
	•	Ian: Objection, asked and answered
	•	Brad: I support this bill as well- the onus should be on everyone to work with each other, rather than for Congress to just work with the President
	•	Moving into pro/con on the amendment
	•	Petros (con): Disagree with the vague wording
	•	Mark (pro): I'm signed on this legislation with the idea that Northwestern students should work with the government. This is an expansion of that principle and gives the committee more room to work.
	•	Brad (pro): Just want to say that they're all culpable to work with each other
	•	Steven (con): President and VP have been the only ones to act in producing meaningful action. Congress is the one to work with since President initiated action. The letter from 300 universities stated working with congress.
	•	Victor (pro): Should prefer this amendment to increase flexibility
	•	Ian: Victor's point is good for freedom. FREEDOM.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is amended.
	•	Ian: Motion to amend  to add in a line to set up voting for the members of this ad-hoc.
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation has additional clause that states "Be it further enacted, that the members of the committee be elected in Senate one week following the passage of this legislation."
	•	Brad: Motion to amend to change "Senators" to "students" so that non-senators can serve
	•	Ian: Motion to amend to 5 members of ASG
	•	Rebecca: I see a valuable point of having students at large on this why can't they be on this?
	•	Ian: More accountable, better to have people who were in the room and had more
	•	Carly: If there was someone outside of ASG who was following this debate completely and wanted to get involved,  would you rethink your motion?
	•	Ian: No
	•	Vote- division
	•	Ay-23
	•	Nay- 7
	•	Abstentions- 3
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is amended to have five members of ASG on ad hoc.
	•	Motoki: Motion to have it say students instead of members of ASG
	•	Ani: Asked and answered
	•	Ani: Now moving to a vote on Brad's amendment
	•	Vote- approved. Legislation now states "5 members of ASG."
	•	Ani: Moving to pro/con on the legislation
	•	Rebecca (con): Let's not make this committee and instead make one that looks into protecting our students here.
	•	Ian (pro): I'm on 6 committees- behooves us to not follow up the resolution with action.
	•	Jesse: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is approved
XII. Good of the Order & Announcements
	•	Brad: Relevant mainly to student groups senators- in the Fall you voted to move Student Group apportionment to winter quarter and your seats are on the table. Make sure it's on your radar
	•	Mike: Two quick announcements. Community Engagement grant deadline in February 1st and Off campus ambassadors are doing an off-campus cook-off
	•	Evan: NU Protest is looking into the gun control debate. If you want to get interviewed let me know
	•	Jesse: Thinking about bringing legislation to say senate can't go past 10, if you want to help write it, let me know.
	•	Katie: Working at center for civic engagement, screening a film called girls on the wall
	•	Abby: Deadline to apply for FUP to be a counselor was extended to Friday at 5pm
	•	Rachel: This Friday night we're having a dinner first year students regardless of religion
	•	Jane: We're selling wristbands to support Josie, please help out
	•	Brad: You can talk to the press on your own free will, but we'd prefer that you talk to becca before you talk to them so we can prepare for any fallout
	•	Victor: buy a cats care shirt!

ASG Senate Minutes
02-06-13

	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	Brad: There are a couple links to Campus Voice in my exec board report, look at them. Try to keep track of the projects that get posted. If there's something you want to work on that gets posted, let me know. I can get you in touch with the right people. Also let me know if you have projects outside of Campus Voice. Also contact me if you want to take on a larger role in ASG next year
	•	Victor: Working on a campus wide music video- please submit ideas about what you want this to look like, we'll be starting shooting in the Spring. Also planning a leadership symposium for May 2nd. Buy a Cats Care shirt!
	•	Steven: If all things are approved, we'll be able to work with the Center for Civic Engagement, but we won't have help for getting volunteers for working registration booths- great for PR requirement, more people the better
	•	David H: A lot of projects are at the 99% mark, expect to see progress soon. We'll be introducing a soft launch for Book Swap, going to ask that you guys submit before we fully launch.
	•	Cab Corner: Taxi-share app- it's complete! Need to add branding and sign a contract, but should be ready for the end of the quarter airport cycle.
	•	Norris Mini-Course Enhancements: Won't be complete change, just improvements mainly? Would anyone want to take a mini-course on Arabic…? Making enhancements
	•	Study Abroad Guide: Please send it out to people who've studied abroad ASAP. Reach out to people you've already sent it to
	•	Neil: Don't have much, just please give feedback on things in my exec board report.
	•	David C: New ASG printer! Let me know about code problems.
	•	Alex: Had a meeting with Connor and SSDP- talked about expanding red watch band training and increasing drug education.
	•	Connor: Not everything in this is concrete- want to expand or incentivize red watch band training to make campus safer. Looking at having all Senators red watch band trained. Also thinking about student groups to gauge interest if it'd be something that certain groups would be interested in doing.
	•	Alex: Feel free to ask me about anything student life related!
	•	Carly: Student Group Senator applications are live, due on the 23rd, please forward over your listservs. Also feel free to speak with me about taking on a larger leadership position in ASG going forward. Also, please respond to OMs if they reach out to you. We'll be doing breakout sessions next week about how to improve. As far as Senator Spotlight goes, want to recognize Rebecca for being a leader last week! Also want to welcome our two newest Senators, Alexander and Andrew!
	•	Alexander: Off-campus Senator, Marine veteran, glad to be here!

	•	Ani: You're required to meet with me, so if you haven't signed up for a time, I'll be emailing you. As Carly said, FVP and SGVP apps are out, due date has been pushed back to the 17th. Make sure to fill out SGAC apps if you wish to retain your seat, and feel free to apply for a seat if you're a group that doesn't currently have one.
	•	Ethan: HEY EVERYBODY!! ASG ONLINE IS ONLINE!!! Please fill out the Senator info form- let me know if there's anything you guys want to see on here.
	•	David: Can you talk about the features and enhancements that will be rolling out?
	•	Ethan: Calendar support for all the exec board members and the general calendars. Also a page on all of our services, including things like JobCat and student group websites, listserv integration, student group funding information, etc. Also, my sister is doing a research study in SESP and needs help finding people
	•	Special Order: Garage Sale Feedback
	•	Chris: Hey everyone, been working on the idea of a campus-wide garage sale to be held in the last week of May, first week of June so that they have a place to sell stuff before moving, but having trouble coming up with a date. Was planning on doing it on June 1st, but that's the day after Dillo Day…
	•	Tori: Won't there be a problem that people will still want to use their furniture before selling it
	•	Mike: Thinking about a way to categorize it using images and PCs.
	•	Ian: What's the utility of having a day to do this when you can have this digital?
	•	Mike: Can still sell smaller furniture, and want to not make this totally digital
	•	Rebecca: Is it a known problem that people can't sell or buy things?
	•	Mike: The idea is to advertise through city of Evanston and have them buy furniture- sometimes when you're moving you just end up throwing things away that you don't have time to store or sell.
	•	David: To address a couple of the concerns- we are reconsidering things like having it online currently and the debate is ongoing- having it in person might be more effective than older initiatives like NU Bodega. We haven't looked at analytics, but this is one of those things that is anecdotally very sensible. Having Evanston and Chicago citizens as a supplemental demographic could be helpful
	•	Mark: This has been very successful for other schools
	•	Mike: We'll be advertising this heavily
	•	Tori: Have you thought about integrating the furniture sale into Wildcat Pad?
	•	David: Not really an option for a number of reasons that we can discuss later. Those of you who are really interested in this, please reach out to me, Mike and Chris. We'd love your feedback, though a lot of these are longer conversations
	•	Ani: Any other comments on the date specifically?
	•	Ian: End of Reading Week?
	•	Mike: Also thinking about Memorial Day Weekend, or last Sunday before finals
	•	Old Business: SR1213-09: Brady Scholars Senior Project: Hoop House
	•	Ani: Due to a miscommunication, the authors aren't here.
	•	Mark: Motion to table for a week
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Legislation will be tabled for a week.
	•	Appendix A: SR1213-XX: Celebrating President Ronald Reagan’s 102nd Birthday
	•	Rebecca: I always celebrate President’s birthdays, and Ronald Reagan is one of my favorite Presidents! It’s his 102nd birthday and I just want to pass a resolution celebrating his birthday. Sorry for bringing this up as emergency, I’m embarrassed to say I didn’t know until today that it was his birthday.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Mark: How do you personally celebrate President's birthdays?
	•	Rebecca: Acknowledge them and their accomplishments, have a cupcake if they're really special.
	•	Jesse: How is this different from celebrating a Presidents birthday on Presidents Day?
	•	Rebecca: Presidents do individual things that don't get recognized then- if someone wants to acknowledge an individual President's birthday, they should.
	•	McKenzie: What would ASG be doing to celebrate this?
	•	Rebecca: Nothing, it's just a resolution to celebrate his birthday. US legislature does this all the time.
	•	Sarah: Should we be presenting legislation for every president's birthday?
	•	Rebecca: Maybe- our collective favorite presidents would probably only encompass a handful of them. 
	•	Paul: William Henry Harrison's birthday is in a few days- would you be amenable to adding a line about him into this?
	•	Rebecca: Sure.
	•	Mike: Also, Chelsea Clinton's Birthday in a few days….
	•	Rebecca: We're just talking about presidents here.
	•	April: What has Reagan done to benefit us as Senators?
	•	Rebecca: Don't want to get into partisan issues.
	•	Mike: If I voted for this, would you make me Reagan cupcakes?
	•	Ani: Not in line.
	•	Alex: Reagan was President of his student government when he was in college!
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question
	•	Senator: Withdrawn
	•	Ani: Moving to pro/con on whether or not to bring this to the floor
	•	Sarah (con): The spirit of this bill is great and it's nice not to talk about something less serious, though we have to consider how we look discussing something like this
	•	Carly (con): Fun to talk about, but the Senator Survey, around 25% of you said Senate was too long and another 17% said you didn't respect each other's times
	•	Petros (pro): Clearly within the bounds of a parliamentary body to bring things like this to the floor. It takes a very short time to decide things and we shouldn't be considering how long Senate takes in whether or not to hear this
	•	Steven (pro): It's still early, and it is his birthday. Let's just hear it.
	•	Ian (con): this could've gone through rules, his birthday is well known, this is not emergency. He's had 101 birthdays before, this is just embarrassing
	•	Alex (con): Just got through passing legislation on gun control and divestment, it'll look bad if it gets out that we're wrestling with issues that are important, but not pertinent
	•	Rebecca(pro): There's a reason I'm doing this today- it's a short Senate. This doesn't tarnish our reputation- we do a lot of real things but we can also have fun.
	•	Katie (point of parliamentary order): Can we go over rules of order as far as interrupting other Senators and talking over others goes?
	•	Ani: Yes, good point. Everyone, please be respectful and don't interrupt those who are speaking
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote on hearing this
	•	Vote- division
	•	Ay- 11
	•	Nay- 29
	•	Abstentions- 0
	•	Vote- fails.  Legislation is not heard.

	•	David H: I nominate either of the two new Senators.
	•	Andy: I accept.
	•	Andrew: I accept.
	•	Ian: Motion to close nomination period.
	•	Ani: Please come up and introduce yourselves and talk a little bit about why you want to be on ad hoc.
	•	Emily: I'm interested in a lot of majors, and I'm a sophomore on student life- this legislation really interested me and I was thrilled about the entire thing and definitely want to get involved
	•	Petros: I'm bio/secondary education, I represent Plex, and I've talked a lot about this in classes and I feel this issue is really underdressed
	•	Brad: I'm a Senior in Journalism and Political Science, Executive Vice President for ASG- I think this is a really important issue that's generally seen as partisan.
	•	Mike: I'm majoring in environmental sciences and something else. I feel passionate about gun control and was a sponsor on the bill
	•	Joshua: I'm a freshman, majoring in musical composition. I became interesting in this issue because I grew up in a very gun-active city in Kentucky and have that perspective.
	•	Alexander: I'm a Junior in Weinberg, a military veteran and a gun owner. This is something I've heard about and been involved with and I'd love to work with how this gets handled.
	•	Andy: I'm new to Senate and want to get more involved. I feel that this is an important issue to discuss.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Motoki: Can you go over the timeline again for this ad hoc?
	•	Ani: They'll report back every 2 weeks, as stated in the legislation.
	•	Mark: How do you view the relationship between gun violence and higher education and how are students important in this debate?
	•	Emily: I found it exciting that this resolution passed. The number of incidents with college campuses and gun violence is increasing and I want to be involved.
	•	Petros: Gun violence on campuses in increasing, I can see that at NIU and other schools across Chicago. It's devastating and it's our responsibility to respect safety for ourselves and future students.
	•	Brad: Agree with all that's been said- the increased incidence of gun violence is shocking, it's important for ASG to be proactive rather than reactive.
	•	Mike: Within the past 10 years, some of the worst incidents of gun violence have occurred. We do need to work toward encouraging the government to decrease gun violence.
	•	Joshua: This is more relevant to us as citizens, than as students.
	•	Alexander: It's important for us as future leaders to discuss and work with issues like this.
	•	Andy: The college student perspective is important to hear, we don't usually hear from college students about issues like this.
	•	Steven: Considering the timeline of outreach and letter writing, do you think you'll have adequate time to commit?
	•	Petros: My current commitments are ending, I'll have time to commit.
	•	Brad: My life is basically ASG, so yes.
	•	Mike: Every hour of my life is blocked out, other candidates might be able to better devote time.
	•	Joshua: No committees, I can devote time.
	•	Alexander: No committees, other commitments, but would have time.
	•	Andy: No committees, other commitments, but would have time.
	•	Emily: I’d have time.
	•	Patrick: What is Northwestern's role and how can we take action?
	•	Brad: NU should be a leader in everything it does, it doesn't always, but this would be great at affecting the conversation and taking a stand.
	•	Mike: I have very liberal beliefs on gun control but realize there are other perspectives and that we need to write this in an appropriate manner.
	•	Joshua: We have no responsibility to speak out on this as students, but we do have a responsibility to talk about as citizens.
	•	Alexander: I oppose gun control, that may not make me popular, but can help produce something that reflects the views of all Northwestern students.
	•	Andy: We're at a top university that produces leaders, so we have to take leadership on this.
	•	Emily: NU can be risk averse to the point of being complacent- if we send something to congress, it'd be huge for people our age.
	•	Petros: This is about caring about a certain issue pertinent to us as students at this university, but also do it in a way that's as least biased as possible. Hope to consider points of NRA and other perspectives on the other side of this.
	•	Evan: What unique perspective can you bring to this process?
	•	Mike: My perspective is very liberal-I'm well versed in issues like this.
	•	Josh: I come from a gun active community in Kentucky and am a gun owner.
	•	Alexander: I'm a gun owner and could be considered conservative, but wouldn't want to skew the views of the committee. Also huge on constitutional law.
	•	Andy: I generally have republican views, but mostly support gun control.
	•	Emily: I'm currently studying to be a law intern. I'm also a woman. Also on NUCHR, which focused on peacekeeping this past year.
	•	Petros: My views on gun control lean slightly left, but as a future educator I hope to advocate for protecting students everywhere. Also considers it important to bring forth perspective about mental health.
	•	Brad: My experience having working in DC is valuable.
	•	Mark: Motion to extend question period by 10 minutes
	•	Ian: How will you strike a balance between advocating for Northwestern and working with other partner institutions?
	•	Joshua: We should consult the entire student body before moving forward. It's very important that we embody the voice of the student body.
	•	Alexander: The more consensus we have, the better off we are.
	•	Andy: As stated, it's important to have a unified stance on the issue, would use Senatorship to this end.
	•	Emily: Tough- want to get the ball rolling on this, but open to having the conversation.
	•	Petros: Want to echo what everyone else has said so far, but need to act soon before support flutters.
	•	Brad: When working in DC, could see how quickly letters got thrown out, but can see how to avoid that by working with the language when drafting this with other universities.
	•	Mike: As ASG, we do represent the voice of the students. I do this as an off-campus caucus member. This specific letter can serve as a model to other universities.
	•	Mark: Can you articulate the opposing viewpoint for gun control?
	•	Alexander: My own personal views don't match up with NU students. Assault weapons are weapons of war- there's a position to be had that civilians shouldn't be trusted to have control of that lethality. Also, background checks are an argument- I don't necessarily oppose that.
	•	Andy: Opposing viewpoint is that the right to bear arms is constitutionally founded, but don't agree that citizens should be able to buy automatic weapons among those lines.
	•	Emily: Also talking about right to bear arms and the constitution. Deals with rights seen as intrinsic by some.
	•	Petros: Opposing viewpoints state that anything that gets in the way of the right to bear arms and any further legislation on it would be constitutionally doubtful.
	•	Brad: Do believe in the importance of second amendment, but don't believe it's an unconditional right.
	•	Mike: Not within the perspective that the 2nd amendment.
	•	Joshua: The opposite viewpoint of my perspective is that with more lethal forms of firearms, greater restrictions should be instated.
	•	Ian H: Motion to end question period
	•	Ani: We're actually out of time!
	•	Moving into an endorsement period
	•	X: X and I were chatting about this- I strongly agree that this should be filled with newer, less involved people so that they can engage on a different kind of issue. All candidates are qualified and articulate.
	•	X: Want to endorse Emily- she's one of the most thoughtful individuals I've met- she's poised and articulate and would be great for this.
	•	X: Want to endorse Alexander- knowing him for 2 days, he is very articulate in giving his perspective while encapsulating others.
	•	X: Would like to make two endorsements for Alexander and Brad
	•	X: Brad did this in DC, very important experience to have on this committee.
	•	X: Want to endorse Petros since he's worked with children in Chicago
	•	X: Want to endorse Josh, he was extremely articulate, and being from an area with guns, his perspective seems invaluable.
	•	X: Going to push Brad too- good to have younger members get involved, but also need a veteran voice- don't discount him just because he's already involved.
	•	X: I think that we do have to take into consideration how much time people have to contribute. Brad might not have time to do the full side of the work.
	•	X: I don't think Brad would've signed up for this committee if he didn't have time.
	•	X: Want to echo the points about Brad. I really respect him as a leader, but the places on this committee are better given to other members on ASG- he'll lend his perspective whether he's on it or not.
	•	X: I know Emily is very invested in this, she has a very good viewpoint and is open to listen to others.
	•	X: Disagree with X, just because they're a new face doesn't mean they should get involved. Should join a standing committee rather than something overly specific like this.
	•	Ani: Votes will be counted following Senate and the announcement of winners will be sent out later tonight.
	•	Good of the Order & Announcements
	•	Rebecca: ASB apps are out, apply!
	•	Ian H: PA apps are live, open until the 18th
	•	Angela: Celebrasia is this Saturday, held by CSA and TASC.
	•	Sarah: Tomorrow is DG lounge- in the DG kitchen, we'll be serving grilled cheese and tater tots, support us!
	•	Paul: Brief update on gender neutral bathrooms working group. Most schools seem to be where we are or ahead of us
	•	Mark: Make sure to distribute our petition. And GREEN CUP, reduce your energy and come to some of the events!
	•	David H: DM trivia starts in 18 minutes, this week's topic is sports
	•	Mike: Part of off-campus ambassadors- having a contest where you can post picture of food you've made. Also a dodgeball tournament. Also talk to me more about the garage sale.

Senate Adjourned
ASG Senate Minutes
02-13-13

	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	Victor: There will be discussion about the Activities Fee, including a Green fee, with Gene Sunshine- I'll update you guys next week. Also planning a leadership symposium in May, would invite 40 different student groups to give opportunity to transition for Presidents and student group leaders.
	•	Cats Care will be releasing t-shirt order form- please order one!
	•	Harlem Shake Northwestern being planned- Burgie and Willie are secured. Still determining location and time- will let you know. It's a quick fad probably and won't happen if it doesn't happen this weekend. Please join in!
	•	Brad: There's a link to a spreadsheet in my exec board report with a list of all the ideas that don't have a response on Campus Voice. There's a lot of stuff on there so be sure to look at it, there are some cool ideas on there.
	•	Carly: Student groups Senate seat apps are due this Saturday, so send them out if you haven't already. Took on a new member of my committee organizing coffee chats. Please respond promptly when they contact you.
	•	Alex: Will be talking to JPK on Friday about Therapy Dogs. Went through Sargent today and will be talking to JPK about opening up study area in CCI section of Sargent hall for a 24 hour space
	•	David: Will be presenting Book Swap soon- otherwise, Cab Corner is all done, Norris wrote a contact for us, just need to submit it to the vendors. Unofficial Student Guide is probably my favorite project, I know I've been pushing it a lot, but we need more information to meet the threshold to fully launch the site. Please pester your friends to do it because it could be something really special
	•	Neil: Not much else to add other than what's in my report- let me know if you have any questions
	•	Ethan: HEY EVERYBODY. Read my exec board report, excited about Book Swap
	•	Steven: Look at my exec board report and fill out Illinois Voter Registration Form.
	•	Brandon: If you’re planning on bringing emergency legislation, please let me know- I can make sure it gets reviewed by Rules and saves us all time.
	•	Ani: We do student group apportionment every year- first time doing this in Winter.
	•	Brad: These are due a week from this Saturday.
	•	Special Order: SAFC Misconduct Investigations
	•	Girish: I was here two weeks ago about three investigations- we've heard all three cases and ultimately voted to pass all three misconducts. As far as the process, none of our recommendations are binding. I have 15 minutes for each case (won't use all that time) anyone who wants to speak up can- 1 hour total of allotted time, probably won't use all that time, but please feel free to speak up.

	•	Girish: Starting with College Feminists- there's a University Policy where you cannot advertise for a speaker before getting contracts signed. Somehow, their schedule was leaked to the press and the event was publicized across campus before contracts were finalized. The board deemed this a misconduct and created three recommendations to prevent future misconducts:
	•	Co chairs attend Winter Quarter audit
	•	Sex week planning committee come up with detailed timeline of planning the event.
	•	Report progress on that timeline to their executive board.
	•	Ani: Any appeals for this case?
	•	Ani: Seeing none, we'll move into a question period
	•	Nouha: Did the University do anything to address this infraction separate from this process?
	•	Girish: No.
	•	Ani: Moving to a discussion period.
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote on granting College Feminists a financial misconduct.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Misconduct granted.

	•	Girish: Next misconduct was for AATE- Coffee event with ASA didn't happen. When groups are funded through the SAF- groups are expected to hold that event to ensure that money allotted isn't wasted. Three recommendations from the SAFC:
	•	Won't be funded by SAF again until it has been put on successfully.
	•	Need to present a document for contingency plan to deal with programming problems
	•	President and Treasurer should read guidelines- if don't won't receive funding
	•	Ani: Any appeals for this case?
	•	Ani: Seeing none, we'll move into a question period
	•	Hannah: If an event can't happen, is there any way a group can come to SAFC to avoid a misconduct?
	•	Girish: It'll always be a violation of our guidelines, but if they come to us early on and let us know, no significant 
	•	Ian: How to test competency of President and Treasurer
	•	Girish: Two ways- online quiz of our guidelines, or simply talk to officers
	•	Ani: Move to discussion
	•	Ani: Move to a vote on granting AATE a financial misconduct.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Misconduct granted.

	•	Girish: Our final misconduct is for Fall Mixer- event was funded by us for 2 years, but money was never used. Investigation was held to try and figure out what was happening- found out there's been a lot of turnover over the past couple years and group officers didn't realize money was there and didn't see urgency in spending money. Our primary recommendation for NPHC is:
	•	Bi-quarterly audits of NPHCs audits by all group officers
	•	Ani: Any appeals for NPHC?
	•	Ani: Any questions?
	•	Ani: Now moving to a discussion period.
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote on granting NPHC a financial misconduct.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Misconduct granted
	•	General Order: Bookswap Presentation
	•	David: I'll let KC take it away- BookSwap was pretty awesome and had universal brand equity, but had a bunch a of problems and a lackluster interface that wasn't sustainable
	•	KC: I'm KC, I'm on the services committee- BookSwap is like a craigslist for students, except only for books. We pull from the bookstore course database- you can type in the course number and can buy or sell books for that class. This system prevents duplicate postings and makes things nice, neat, and organized. As David mentioned, this is a great resource for students that's faster, locally based and more convenient than marketplaces like ebay. BookSwap only works if people are using it. It'll be a hard launch since sellers won't be attracted if buys aren't around, and buys wont come if sellers aren't buying, so we need a large number of both buys and sellers to come onto the website at launch- please list your books here once it launches
	•	David: Hoping to have website glossy and polished by next week, but wanted to give you guys a heads up- in the next 7 days, please search for old books and get ready to make a little money off them.
	•	Ani: Any questions?
	•	Alex Lower: Can you search by department or course number?
	•	KC: Yeah, you can search by just about any metric (ISBN, department, course number) except course title, which is standard for most bookstores.
	•	General Order: Laptop Chargers Announcement
	•	Ian: Had meeting with head of Mudd Library- Mudd sees half the volume of people that Main sees, so we're recommending that 3 of the 10 laptop chargers be sent to Mudd. Also, regarding PC chargers, we found a PC charger line that works with most PCs, plan on coming to Senate to get more money to buy more chargers from the project pool
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Abby: How did you decide on the 7/3 division?
	•	Ian: It'd make sense to have half the chargers in Mudd, but PCs seem to be used more in Mudd and makes more logical sense this way.
	•	Patrick: It's a stretch to assume Mudd library users use PCs more often
	•	Ian: Makes more sense to err lower since we haven't had chargers here before, and chargers are used in library in double digits.
	•	Motoki: How do we know this is the most optimal way to split up the charger distribution?
	•	Ian: We don't know the optimal amount at main library, but all of the chargers are being used on most occasions, so there is optimization.
	•	Rebecca: Have you looked into lowering the time that you can rent out chargers? 3 hours is the current time limit and seems long
	•	Ian: No- this committee has pretty much run its course with utility- we can look into it and maybe incorporate it into next week's bill.
	•	General Order: Dining Hall Reform Working Group Presentation
	•	McKenzie: We formed this working group to look into evaluating dining hall hours, including COFHE research.
	•	Petros: Did COFHE research, collected data based on number of undergrads and number of dining halls and hours. In terms of our consortium, the undergraduate populations have a wide range from 1,300 to 13,000- varies per dining hall location. We have around 1500 students per dining location, and NU is the third largest school in COFHE, so our ratio is actually very favorable. Dining hall hours don't vary that much, but don't extend more than 3 or 4 hours, just change in when they start and end.
	•	Connor: We approached JPK and Steve Mangan, approached them with this information and our initial goals. They're looking at utilizing this data- it was comprehensive, they identified some complications with shifting dining hall hours- like union contracts and agreements and the fact that people do use the dining halls during early hours. We wanted to use this working group to make this need known and it is now known.
	•	Ani: Any questions about any of this?
	•	Brad: Have you done any research into pricing and the number of dining halls served, relative to costs that makes overhead huge?
	•	Connor: 6 dining halls is a lot, we talked about this.
	•	Petros: Having so many dining halls just generates a higher cost in general
	•	David: Brad brings up a good point and there are other issues, will your working group be addressing them?
	•	McKenzie: There are other issues that we could work on or discuss- we mainly wanted to focus on the original purpose of the working group.
	•	David: Do you have ideas for what we can do moving forward, or is waiting the only option for right now?
	•	Mckenzie: We probably don't have enough to bring up right now, and with these two issues, I feel as if we've reached our potential.
	•	Old Business: SR1213-09: Brady Scholars Senior Project: Hoop House
	•	Ummul: Here to request support for the Brady Scholar's Senior Project to create a hoop house that will produce fresh produce to Northwestern through an organization called New Leaf Urban Gardens. To clarify on the tomatoes- they produced 7,000 pounds of tomatoes in their current hoop house. Some updates- we met with Steve Mangan with Sodexho, and they've expressed interest May be able to use greenhouse near the Evanston art house to start. With ASG support, it's more likely this'll go through.
	•	Ani: Any questions?
	•	Ian: You mentioned building this on Norris East Lawn last week- is this still on the table?
	•	Ummul: Rob Whittier expressed concern with the aesthetic aspect of this
	•	Abby: Did you look to the area next to Ford?
	•	Ummul: Lot of events held there, but haven't brought it up, so it's possible!
	•	Chris: What's the timeline?
	•	Ummul: We're all seniors, would begin building in spring if everything worked out, maybe extend into summer if necessary.
	•	Jane: Any other areas besides Ford and Plex?
	•	Ummul: Can't build on field- might build on basketball courts or remove 3 or 4 parking spaces, or behind one of the buildings near plex.
	•	Mark: Motion to amend, important to keep this resolution within the frame of ASG- need to change be it further resolved
	•	Vote- approved. Legislation is amended.
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote on the legislation.
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Legislation is passed.
	•	 Special Order: Senator Break-out Session
	•	Carly: As you know, Operations has been hard at work to get an idea of how this will go- we're looking for goals and a deeper more holistic understanding of who we are. We thought that a focus group might be a good idea of determining this. Your names will be kept confidential, just want to get an idea of how you guys feel. We'll be breaking up into small discussion groups led by the OMs.
	•	New Business: SL1213-22: Parliamentary Body Code Legislation
	•	Lauren: This bill is in two parts- the first has the elimination of the Treasurer position. The Treasurer position is superfluous because of the FVP. The Treasurer's responsibilities will be rolled into the EVP's position. The second part of this bill moves the caucus whips up into the parliamentary body.
	•	Sarah: The Treasurer position has traditionally had less work than the rest of the executive board- moving up the caucus whips addresses any loss in power from the parliamentary body that removing the treasurer would cause.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian: Should the whips be moved up regardless of whether or not the treasurer is removed?
	•	Sarah: Yes- this codifies existing practices.
	•	Dana: Is the inactivity of the treasurer due to the position or the people who've been selected for it?
	•	Sarah: It's a problem with the position- these issues have been encountered almost every year.
	•	Lauren: MLK day budget is being reduced, further reducing the treasurer's role.
	•	Ian: A concern in my caucus is that the EVP responsibilities have been widely expanded-how to ensure that the EVP can handle this work.
	•	Sarah: Brad can speak best to this.
	•	Brad: The reasoning is that- we created the Chief of Staff position that allows us to do things concerned with human resources like surveys that we couldn't do before. The chief of staff has taken up a lot of the human resources aspects of my position freeing me up to take on other projects, like campus voice.
	•	Rebecca: With the additions to this position, do you think this will be accessible to those outside of ASG?
	•	Sarah: Yes- the treasurer is traditionally someone from outside of ASG as things are now.
	•	Motoki: Does the exec board have business that they vote on?
	•	Brad: We have the ability to vote on things, but everything needs Senate approval, so we usually don't.  In practice, we've simply either agreed or come to Senate presenting both perspectives on the issue.
	•	Mike: We have a treasurer who does 3-4 hours per week now, would the 3 hours make a difference for the EVP? Would this duty deter someone for running for EVP who would be a great candidate?
	•	Brad: We wrote into the legislation that the EVP has to go through SOFO training and can use the FVP as a resource. Typically, a freshman has run for the position outside of ASG who may be financially inclined, but has learned on the job. That practice will remain steady.
	•	Sarah: The EVP's job is to deal with internal workings of ASG and working with internal finance goes along with that
	•	Mike: The Treasurer is on the Senate side- do you think that absorbing this position destroys a check of power?
	•	Lauren: It's in our constitution that anything over $250 has to be approved by Senate
	•	Brad: Also added in that a quarterly summary of spending has to be presented to Senate.
	•	Motoki: Would these caucus whips be sitting in all the exec board meetings?
	•	Sarah: Just one weekly exec board meeting
	•	Lauren: As whips, we interact with Senators more than Speaker- Senate voice is enhanced in this way.
	•	Mike: If the role is being deleted- have we thought about changing things around to still increase transparency?
	•	Sarah: We're not getting rid of the Treasurer position to increase transparency necessarily, mainly focused on the fact that the Treasurer doesn't do much work.
	•	New Business: SL1213-23: Parliamentary Body Constitutional Amendment
	•	Lauren: Basically the same thing- the Treasurer position is in the Constitution so we'd need to remove it here as well.
	•	Brad: Also adds in the caucus system, which isn't currently mentioned in the Constitution and is vague in the code. The forum will be this coming Tuesday at 7pm.
	•	David H (point of information): Another point that needs to be addressed out of pragmatism is that the Treasurer doesn't do much to represent Senate- and the two Treasurers I've known haven't really gone out of their way to defend Senate.
	•	Brad: Additionally, the Treasurer is overseen by Victor, not by Ani. Senate elects them, they're pseudo on the parliamentary body, but Victor oversees them. This fixes this inconsistency in our code.
	•	Ani: Any questions?
	•	Mike: Has any COFHE research been done in terms of how the treasurer works at other universities?
	•	Brad: We've done an extensive amount of research on other institution student government executive boards- it's significantly larger than other executive boards. Every treasurer is done differently at different schools- but generally, other boards that elevate the treasurer to the same level have larger responsibilities to match.
	•	New Business: SL1212-24: Free James Foley
	•	Ani: This is the second time that I have brought legislation to the floor regarding James Foley. He was captured detained. He was released safely, he was a reporter known for his unbiased reporting, after his release he went to Syria and was abducted by unidentified men and it has been over 80 days, this bill asks us as members of the ASG, to spread the word. He is a wildcat, we need to get people to sign the bill, at least people know. It would mean a lot to his family. There is a petition on the site, its in Arabic and English, that’s kind of it. I would deeply appreciate it to move it to old business.
	•	Ian: When you say all available resources and channels, what do you mean?
	•	Ani: Daily, sign the apeal, post on Facebook, at the discretion of the VP. The reason it is so vague is that I don’t know what the situation is or will be as things go forward.
	•	Mark: you mentioned  points, finding James Foley and then supporting the family
	•	Ani: I have not spoken to the family at all, I believe Medill has a link, I think that is the link. I think his brother is setting up the site and making sure the site is publicized
	•	Evan: printing flyers, and you said you didn’t know how you would be asking us to commit,
	•	Ani: I would leave that up to Brad and Becca, you can give input, if flyers are not the best, we have online resources, I don’t want to dictate what PR methods we use.
	•	Mark: Motion to make this old business.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Legislation is now old business.
	•	Mark: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously . Legislation is approved.
	•	New Business: SR1213-10: Administration Transparency
	•	Harrison: I'm the Senator for mid-quads- some people in my hall com brought this issue up to me and hoped that ASG could take up this issue. Rabbi Klein has been hugely successful and the Chabad house has been great for Northwestern as a whole. A lot of stakeholders are involved- namely, university staff- we simply want transparency to make information known to students. The second major stakeholder is to advocate for transparency on behalf of students and alumni. We're not taking a side, but Chabad sees this as positive for getting more students informed on the issue
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian: You say this seeks transparency, yet in the last clause, it endorses affiliation, which calls for action?
	•	Harrison: We say that we want to open channels of communication and promote transparency- we could amend next week if you feel this language takes a side.
	•	Sarah: Isn't there an issue with the lawsuit that the university cannot be more transparent?
	•	Harrison: Hoping to access public information- there should be some documents available that are public and want the university to promote the idea that they are amenable to being transparent on this issue.
	•	Dana: What do you mean by transparency- what more are you asking for?
	•	Harrison: The information might be able to find by someone who wants to find it, but it should be available to the Northwestern  public at large.
	•	Brad: Is it out of line to direct questions to northwestern admin in the room?
	•	Ani: Typically allowed.
	•	Brad: Natalie, can you verify what information the university can share?
	•	Natalie: Not trying to hide anything- anything we released would be scrutinized by the court. It's your job as a concerned student to find public info0rmation, not the university's job to do so, from a legal standpoint, it looks bad if the university publically releases information. Rabbi Klein himself has released a lot of info about this.
	•	Petros: I don't understand the purpose of this legislation, it seems muddled and the title doesn't seem to fit.
	•	Harrison: I think that since this is a constituency need, I want to follow through on their original vision and have the bill more focused on Chabad house- we could definitely change this through the amendment process
	•	Ian: Would it be more expedient for you all to investigate the information themselves rather than urging the administration?
	•	Harrison: Interested parties feel they should take a stance on this- we can take that route if that happens, but as things stand, this will only happen through ASG not other avenues.
	•	Ani: This is new business, will be discussed as old business next week
	•	 New Business: B-Status Funding for Spring 2013
	•	Ani: Funding is new business this week, will be old next week. Look through the packet, especially if you're part of this group
	•	Motoki: If you have any groups concerned about this, SGC will look over this again next Monday before it becomes old business. Please let group representatives to contact their GEs if they want to appeal.

	•	Victor: Thanks to those of you who came out to the NU Harlem Shake on Sunday- that's our practice run for the larger campus wide music video that we'll be talking to PTI about. We'll also be having focus groups about UCS next week- please respond to the email we'll be sending out if you're interested and have experiences with UCS, good or bad. DSTA apps are down to the final few, selecting soon- and One Book One Northwestern book will be selected in the next month.
	•	Brad: Met with Kelly Schafer, new executive director of the Norris center. Talked about a lot of ideas, including a staff member that checks Campus Voice everyday for Norris issues- hope this expands. Also will have presentation from David about Cab Corner soon that he wanted me to tell you all to look out for.
	•	Alex: Therapy dogs will be happening- read my exec board report for various updates, let me know if you have any questions.
	•	Neil: Want to reiterate what Victor said about UCS, check out faculty honor roll and forward it out to people.
	•	Steven: Off-Campus office confirmed we'll have an apartment/sublet search service next quarter- thanks to off-campus office for that!
	•	Ethan: HEY EVERYBODY! Read my exec board report!
	•	Carly: Please respond to your OM about coffee chats- everyone eats lunch, contact Emily Schraudenbach. Senator spotlight for Alex Lower- his proposal to have NU radio playing in dining halls was fantastic and a great idea to implement.
	•	Victor: Hayley wanted us to pass on that we have a proposal for a diversity requirement- going to faculty senate for a vote next.
	•	Ian: I can talk a little bit more on this- the proposal will be released to student body on Monday- this proposal needs to go through the faculty senate- we'll be arranging trainings for students to go to school admin and tell them why this requirement is important to the Northwestern curriculum. More info will be coming.
	•	Brandon: By my records there are three people who cannot vote tonight due to an absence last week: Kevin, Corrine, & Sean. You also cannot vote if you are subbing for someone.
	•	General Order: Director of Residential Life Confirmation
	•	Alex: Been utilizing director positions to promote members of my committee to have a leadership position. Anna’s been on the committee since last spring and is really driven and would be great for this position. Needs to be confirmed for this position since she will be speaking on behalf of residential life.
	•	Ani: Questions about the position?
	•	Ian: What do you envision this role overseeing?
	•	Alex: The equivalent of Paul Riehl, would be meeting with him on a regular basis to keep a pulse on residential issues and know what's going on with residential life and taking the lead on residential life projects. Would be my sort of go to person for residential life projects that come up.
	•	Rebecca: Term period?
	•	Alex: As long as she wants to be in this position or as long as she's on the committee and wishes to maintain this position.
	•	Brad: To clarify our committee structure- our committees are staffed by our Executive Vice President, it's up to the sitting Executive Vice President to determine whether directors are still relevant.
	•	Anna: I'm a Junior in the School of Communications- I've done a lot with athletics, parking, residential services on several projects. I don't see my role as being another Alex, but as a right hand to Alex. I'm really excited about it.
	•	Ani: Questions for Anna?
	•	Ian: How do you plan on working with RHA and RCB?
	•	Anna: Paul will be very helpful- initially I'll let him take the reigns, but when I get a better feel for both groups, I'll be able to have a better handle for communicating with them and will work with both groups effectively.
	•	Alex: Residential forum next week will be good to start this communication.
	•	Ani: Moving into a discussion/debate period.
	•	X: ResLife is near and dear to my heart- wasn't the best answer, but I trust Alex.
	•	X: Anna was my PA and she was super on top of her game and I'm sure she'd be great.
	•	X: I worked with her, she's incredibly goal-oriented and likable, which I think is important for this position.
	•	X: She does work really well with people and gets stuff done since she's able to connect really well.
	•	X: Want to reiterate- her responsibility is to students, not Paul Riehl, and her ability to work with RHA and RCB is paramount.
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote on confirming Anna.
	•	Vote- passed. Anna is confirmed as the ASG Student Life Director of Residential Life.
	•	General Order: Campaign Reform Survey
	•	Abby: Our committee was formed 3 weeks ago, looked at COFHE schools of various sizes in various metrics- from there we met and created a survey to see what you all want in the election process. In the agenda, you all received a link to the survey- we broke it down into different categories. Just want to get an idea of what you guys think would be best for the election period going forward.
	•	Brad: Are you saying you're opposed to having the entire campus running for election commission?
	•	Motoki: We tried to throw out our ideas about what the process is like now and wanted to know what Senators think.
	•	Abby: If you have feedback about this, we'd love to hear about it in the comments section.
	•	Abby: I'll go through the survey...
	•	General Order: Financial & Student Group VP Selection Committee Senator Election
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Katie: Timeline for selection?
	•	Girish: For mine, this weekend, or early next week. Not a huge time commitment
	•	Lauren: Probably next week is when interviews will happen.
	•	Ani: Opening the floor for nominations
	•	Tori: I nominate Patrick.
	•	Patrick: I accept.
	•	Senator: I nominate Katie.
	•	Katie: I accept.
	•	Ani: Introduce yourselves
	•	Patrick: I'm a Junior and just finished my obligation with the community engagement grant ad hoc and want to have a place influencing the future of student groups at Northwestern.
	•	Katie: My second year in Senate- I'm a student groups Senator representing NCDC. Student groups Senators have a vested interest in ensuring the FVP is quality and would be glad to be involved in the selection process.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian: What A-status groups are you a large part of and are there any conflicts of interest?
	•	Katie: I'm in NCDC, but pride myself on being objective and have been in other positions. Most interested that future leadership is most qualified.
	•	Patrick: I'm on the leadership of A&O and Mayfest, but think it's good that I'm not a student groups Senator.
	•	Girish: In 30 seconds or less, what does the FVP do?
	•	Patrick: The FVP is a coordinator and communicator who oversees funding and ensures good communication between groups and ASG.
	•	Katie: Needs to oversee guidelines, manage misconducts, know what they're doing with money, be impartial.
	•	Ani: Moving into a discussion period.
	•	X: Want to endorse Katie- she gave the better answer, been on Rules, her experience as a student group Senator is important- I know she'll be impartial and she's a quality person.
	•	X: want to echo X's words- the fact that she's a student group Senator means that she likely interacts more with SAFC and Katie would have a better handle on choosing a good FVP.
	•	Ani: Opening the floor for nominations for a Senator for the SGC selection committee.
	•	Alex Lower: I nominate Motoki.
	•	Motoki: I accept.
	•	Ani: Nomination period is closed.
	•	Senator: Motion to white ballot.
	•	Ani: Need to give at least one speech before we can white ballot.
	•	Ani: Please tells us a bit about why you're interested in being on this selection committee.
	•	Motoki: I'm the longest standing Senator in Senate, I'm on SGC and think I'm qualified to help select the next SGVP.
	•	Senator: Motion to white ballot.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Motoki is on the SGVP selection committee.
	•	Ani: Votes have been counted- Katie won the election for the FVP selection committee spot.
	•	General Order: Firearm Regulation Ad-hoc Committee Letter Presentation
	•	Alexander: Been working on this letter for the last couple weeks- we're going to send this letter as Northwestern University, but will be contacting other schools to get their support. Wanted to give a chance to Senate to look over the letter before we submitted anything.
	•	Steven: Let me or Alex know if you have any major suggestions, we'll start talking to others tomorrow, barring any major objections. This draft is endorsed by all members of the committee
	•	Ani: Any questions on the letter? Send comments to the authors.
	•	Old Business: SR1213-10: Administration Transparency
	•	Harrison: Motion to move this up on the agenda to now.
	•	Harrison: A lot of people here to talk about this- funding will take a while and want to get this voted on.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Motoki (con): A lot of student group leaders here waiting for funding as well.
	•	Ian (con): Funding is an essential part of ASG- a resolution isn't. Prioritizing  a resolution over funding isn't acceptable.
	•	Aaron (pro): These people are taking time out of their days- I have to leave at 9, if you could do me a favor, please spare me and my friends from sitting through funding.

	•	Pablo: I manage outreach for ISA World Cup, we invite every cultural group on campus. Our request was cut down to half, so an additional $50 would be good.
	•	Ani: SGC Opinion?
	•	Paul: We recommended $150 since it's their first time applying and their application was late.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Senator: What was the problem with the application submission?
	•	Paul: Didn't cc Lauren on it, so their application ended up not getting reviewed in the first round of initial hearings.
	•	Mark: What's the exact problem with their application?
	•	Lauren: Application wasn't cc'ed to me- seems simple, but caused a lot of extra meetings and deliberation, had to plan two additional meetings since it was vague as well.
	•	Ian: Is it SGC policy to fully fund a new line item?
	•	Lauren: Generally no- we know this event and have seen it be successful, but we've never funded it ourselves and have no point of reference for judging it's  successfulness when funded by us.
	•	Brad (point of information): Came before Senate with a project pool request for this event previously because they missed the application deadline and didn't get additional funding from us.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con.
	•	Ian (con): An incorrect submission this year and a missed submission last year, it seemed to go well without us last year and will still go well with less funding from us this year.
	•	Pablo (pro): We hope to improve and expand the event- I'm part of the organization and take responsibility, but wasn't personally accountable for this problem
	•	Alexander (con): $50 is a third of someone's activity fee- it's important.
	•	Paul: Motion to previous question.

	•	ISA World Cup
	•	ISA World Cup 1: Motion to add $100 for goals
	•	ISA World Cup 1: Largest student run athletic event at NU- have students from all over campus- we need two extra goals. It's annoying to keep up with two broken goals on the day of the tournament and want to have as many fields playing as possible to ensure things run smoothly.
	•	ISA World Cup 2: We will reuse these every year.
	•	Ani: SGC opinion?
	•	Motoki: Just received B-status a month back- usually fund newer groups more conservatively. Also didn't fund this last year, didn't see a reason to fund when they can just rent from the university. Felt comfortable funding one of the goals, not two.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Jane: Have you looked into fixing them?
	•	ISA World Cup 1: Don't have specifics on the goals, another committee handles this- the two goals were cheaper and some of the goals were handmade
	•	Mark: Could the SGC or ISA talk about goal rentals?
	•	ISA World Cup 1: We tried working with Athletics, but they've been uncooperative with us and don't like to rent us soccer balls
	•	Alex (question): If you plan on buying goals this year, how do you plan on storing them between years
	•	ISA World Cup 2: Will be stored in MCC.
	•	Ian: Should you be funded money for an extra goal, can you see a way to give these to other student groups throughout the year?
	•	ISA World Cup 2: Wouldn't be against it I guess.
	•	Ian: Let me rephrase- have you loaned goals to other groups in the past?
	•	ISA World Cup 1: No.
	•	Aaron: Is there a registration fee and where does that fee go?
	•	ISA World Cup 1: $7 and goes toward our programming and other events. It's very valuable to us and is used for other things.
	•	Mark: Can you explain how these goals were damaged and how you'll prevent this in the future?
	•	ISA World Cup 1: Mainly just wear and tear- the goals we have just aren't that great. The ones we're looking into getting this year would be more durable.
	•	Mark: What you're describing seems repairable?
	•	ISA World Cup 2: Hard for us to say since we weren't the ones who checked them- they're likely dented and makes it difficult to put them together.
	•	Evan: You said all your goals are in mediocre state- is there any way to prevent this from happening every year?
	•	ISA World Cup 1: As we said, we're going to try and buy more durable goals and likely won't come back more goals since we feel like our other goals are in fine condition.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Motoki (con): Want to be conservative with new groups
	•	David: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- passed. Additional funding is approved.
	•	ISA World Cup 1: Motion to add $100 for a medic as well.
	•	ISA World Cup 1: We have 450 people registered to play in the spring, 2-day event- it's $25 per hour, so we're asking for money to fund a medic for an additional 4 hours.
	•	ISA World Cup 2: Medic last year was swamped and difficult to find.
	•	Ani: SGC opinion?
	•	Lauren M: Same reasoning- we support safety, but they're a new group and need to hold them to same standard as any other group that's applying for the first time. Don't think that not funding this will mean they won't get a medic- they'll get one and will just have to make cuts elsewhere.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Senator: You mentioned in the application that this is in line with previous allocations- were they allotted this same amount last year?
	•	Lauren: We tend to look back at previous applications, we tried to make it as fair as possible.
	•	Jane: Have you thought about upping your entrance cost to cover the medic?
	•	ISA World Cup 1: We've actually increased it already- we want to keep the registration cost low so that everyone who wants to get involved can get involved.
	•	Jane: Have you thought about cutting costs in other areas?
	•	ISA World Cup 1: Like Lauren said, we'll have a medic, we're just asking for a little more support.
	•	ISA World Cup 2: Some of the concern is that you guys don't want to fully cover our budget- we have a budget of around $10,000, we have other offices funding the bulk of our expenses, this would be supplementary
	•	Alexander: Have you thought about first aid training for students for less serious things?
	•	ISA World Cup 1: No- but good idea, haven't thought of before.
	•	Ian: Have you considered partnering with Feinberg to have an alumna to help manage this?
	•	ISA World Cup 2: Relatively new program, still building alumna network, but we could look into that as well.
	•	Jane: Have you gone to other donors about funding this?
	•	ISA World Cup 1: Lots of other aspects not included here that need to be taken into account that they're covering.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con.
	•	Jane (con): We've already funded them an additional $100, seems like they could get other sources of funding doesn't make sense, and they're a new group.
	•	Angela (con): We already funded them $100- there are many other places they could go for this sort of support.

	•	Relay for Life 1: Motion to add $100 items to line item for photo booth rental
	•	Relay for Life 1: We had this event for the past 8 years- we'd get the photo booth for entire night, it's essential to our programming and is essential to celebrating those who've survived cancer. As an investment, we've talked to many vendors to get the cost down, we'll be fundraising a lot of this as well. Better for liability than bounce house and saves us from doing a lot of paperwork.
	•	Ani: SGC Opinion?
	•	Lauren: While the event isn't new, the photo booth rental is new. We're being conservative in case this doesn't work out. We try to be a supplementary funding pool to events, we don't see the photo booth as essential to the event happening.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Jane: Have you looked at other sources of funding besides ACS and ASG?
	•	Relay for Life 2: We try to keep our overhead costs low and most of our other costs are donated.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Lauren (con): We recommend funding at half for this year due to constraints of the pool.
	•	Lauren M (con): We are really limited this year- keep in mind that this is a funding accessory to the event and isn't necessary to the event happening successfully.
	•	SGC Member (con?): I won't stand up and will speak quietly so the Parliamentarian can't hear what I'm saying.
	•	Relay for Life 1 (pro): Don't see how this could be seen as unnecessary.
	•	Hannah (question): Any information on why this isn't being funded now?
	•	Lauren M: It's a new item for the event and we've had more groups request this year, so we needed to cut back wherever we could.
	•	Connor (pro): A lot of what we do with funding is based on precedent- if they received this money in the past, they should get it now- they outlined a lot of different reasons why this is essential, I urge you to support this.
	•	Rebecca (pro): They shouldn't be punished for coming up with a better idea.
	•	Ian (con): SGC is justified in funding a little bit less since this is so new- they're both fun add-ons and it makes sense for them to fund a little bit less.
	•	Lauren (con): We had to make cuts where cuts could be made- I'm glad you're switching to a photo booth, you still would've been cut if you got the bounce house. We really needed to cut.
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote.
	•	Vote- fails. Additional funding is not approved.

	•	Relay for Life 1: Motion to amend line item for photo booth to $75
	•	Senator: Asked and answered?
	•	Ani: Different enough to warrant allowing this.
	•	Relay for Life 2: We get most of our funding from canning- we don't ask for much- we wanted to reduce some our other line items to get more funding for this.
	•	Ani: SGC Opinion?
	•	Lauren M: Same exact reasoning- I've been here since Winter 2010. This happened previously, they requested a lower and lower amount until they got it. We talked a lot about the photo booth.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Jane: Have you asked anyone besides ACS and ASG about this?
	•	Relay: Only groups we ask from, no one else will fund.
	•	Ian: How much were you funded last time they were funded?
	•	Lauren M: $720. All groups are expected to fundraise- we only funded a lot of the events partially and encourage groups to get creative based on their purpose.
	•	Jane: Current fee for relay and have you thought about raising it?
	•	Relay for Life 1: $10 and American Cancer Society sets that. This is funding that we deserve, I don't see what the problem is.
	•	Lauren M: ASG funding is only supposed to go to Northwestern students. A lot of the SAF funds should stay here and go to students and not the American Cancer Society. 
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con.
	•	Paul (con): If 47 groups applied, as opposed to 30, I'm sure groups got cut across the board- would be unfair to fund any group additional funds with this in mind. It's a great cause.
	•	Rebecca (pro): Important to note that these girls are here because they're here sitting through all this- while we usually do adhere to SGC opinion, if we think this is fun or useful, we, as Senate, can let them have fun.
	•	Alexander (con): This isn't just free money that exists in a vacuum, this is student money we have to take seriously. I think the committee's recommendations are fair. This is the students money that we have to prudently allocate.
	•	Mike (question): What happens to funding not used
	•	Ani: We've been over this- it goes into next funding cycle.
	•	Senator (pro): They've taken a major cut, fair to fund them this.
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote.
	•	Vote-
	•	Ay- 11
	•	Nay- 22
	•	Abstentions- 1
	•	Motion fails. Additional funding is not approved.
	•	Senator: Motion to suspend the rules and close funding.
	•	Vote- passed. Funding is closed.
	•	General Order: Cab Corner Launch
	•	David: Been talking with services about way to make things more effective and one of the ways we've done this is making Cab Corner
	•	Alex: Wanted to make this app to give students an easy way to connect with other students for organizing cabs shares, just want to introduce app and show how it works.
	•	David: Questions?
	•	Alexander: How to stop people from ditching rides?
	•	Alex: Valid concern- if someone decided to duck out, we're not sure what we'd do in that situation, maybe put a flag on their account.
	•	Morgan: Limit on how many people can join a ride?
	•	Alex: I think it's two people currently, might be future development to allow larger rides.
	•	Abby: Is this tied to a certain cab company?
	•	Alex: We have a database with fare information- not attributed to just one.
	•	Mark: Great service- as AVP for Sustainability, I need to speak up. This isn't more sustainable, you should strike all language about this being sustainable for our institution.
	•	David: I spoke with you about this and we contracted this site from someone else, so we can strongly request they change this, but not demand. Will work to do so.
	•	Paul: I know this is done through an outside company- can you include options for non-gender/transgender individuals?
	•	Alex: Thought this would be easily fixable- working on getting them to change this.
	•	Ian: Can we tie this in with a NetID?
	•	David: Would have to give CabCorner access to NetID and passwords…
	•	Ian: Say no more.
	•	David: We have pretty fliers for you to post up, please bring them back to your dorms- we'll be back to encourage additional PR closer to spring break. Thanks for hearing us out!
	•	Old Business: SR1213-10: Administration Transparency
	•	Harrison: Similar to the bill you saw last week- changed language to create a stronger bill more favorable to the student body.
	•	Harrison: Motion to amend- change in title, striking second be it resolved clause, changing language in first be it resolved.
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. Amendments are now included in the bill.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Alexander (con): This places unfair responsibility on administration, who've already stated that they cannot release additional information about this matter.
	•	Matthew Renick (pro): I'm the head of Chabad's student executive board- Harrison made a great point in saying this bill is focused on transparency. Transparency is good for moving forward, good for showing the administration that in the future, administration should be transparent.
	•	Brad (con): I appreciate you all writing this, but this is a non-starter and will only serve to antagonize administrators. Won't enact any change- will only serve to jeopardize our working relations with administration and won't be worth it. We've been in meetings where they've told us if you pass this nothing will happen. If we change the language of the bill to focus on Administration transparency, then maybe it can be more productive
	•	Ian (pro): Saying this will jeopardize our relationship with the administration is a bit much. Though not everyone may not have gotten to know Rabbi Klein, he is a powerful individual. We can ask for more information and should pursue that information ourselves. Not futile for voicing our opinion on this.
	•	Jesse (con): We all know that the university can't comment on this- if we ask them to comment on things preemptively is a little unfair- we should trust our administrators to give us information.
	•	Natalie (con): The university isn't trying to subdue information, it's a legal case that the university can't speak on. You're welcome to find information yourself, but passing this won't change anything.
	•	Senator: Motion to extend debate period by 5 minutes.
	•	Vote- passed. Debate period is extended by 5 minutes.
	•	Ani: Moving into more pro/con.
	•	Meredith (pro): I know a lot of you aren't Jewish and Chabad doesn't have a role in your  lives. Wrote a speech but won't have time to read it so I'll summarize. He was a first responder, has comforted students on campus during tough times. He is a selfless man and can help a lot of people on this campus, the transparency will help everyone see what a great community leader he is
	•	Victor (con): I don't like that this is becoming a discussion about the person in question. This is about the legal case- Chabad is great, Rabbi Klein is a good guy, but good people can still do wrong. We've done what we've can in promoting transparency- this resolution is asking us to go to PTI with the same question and would get us the same answer. This isn't the most productive approach. We can possibly have PTI come into talk, but I don't know if she'll have a lot to say. We've already explored this route.
	•	Evan (pro): This legislation represents what ASG is meant for- we're not going to get much more information from this resolution- it's about the right to ask for information. Our purpose as ASG is to give students a voice.
	•	Senator: Motion to extend debate period by 5 minutes.
	•	Vote- passed. Debate period is extended by 5 minutes.
	•	Ani: Moving into more pro/con.
	•	Alexander (con): The questions have already been asked and answered- there's not more that we can reasonably, practically do. No use in trying to squeeze blood from a stone
	•	Brad (con): That is what ASG is for- we met with PTI immediately after this happened in fall quarter. We've discussed this with Senators between then and now- getting the same answers isn't a productive use of our time. We are open to meeting with your executive board and finding these documents, but we can't go back to the administration for answers.
	•	Nick (pro):  Want to echo what Evan stated- you all are voices of the student body and this is very important to us. We want this as a precedent to move forward and know that ASG supports transparency for student groups on campus. Our group and Rabbi Klein are stunned by the administration's actions after 18 years on campus. To his knowledge, everything that he did was correct and protected- please just pass this bill to support him, if nothing else.
	•	Carly (con): Want to make sure everyone is aware that when issues arise, we meet them and exceed them. With mental health and other issues we've been doing our job and meeting with administrators- I don't think we need to write legislation to state what we're already doing.
	•	Ani: In line for a vote on the bill itself.
	•	Vote- division
	•	Ay: 16
	•	Nay: 11
	•	Abstentions: 6
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is approved.
	•	New Business: SL1213-25: Expanding the Library Charger Program
	•	Ian: I told you this was coming, talked with Mudd and Main Library, decided to send 7 chargers to Main, 3 to Mudd. Demonstrated interest in expanding into PC chargers, seems to work well based on reviews. Recommending 4 be bought to be sent up to Mudd, 2 to be sent up to main, since engineers tend to be up north and use PCs for their work.
	•	Ani: Any questions?
	•	Abby: Buying these through amazon?
	•	Ian: Yes
	•	David H: Motion to move this to old business
	•	Vote-passed. Legislation is now old business.
	•	Ian: I am interested to hear if people think we should buy more at a lower price now or less.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Alexander: Will this lead to ASG buying large quantities of things up whenever there's a sale?
	•	Ian: There is a potential for a slippery slope, but only 4 chargers.
	•	Mark: Motion to previous question
	•	Alex: Objection
	•	Alex: Would like to amend so that the bill states that $240 be granted to library committee to be spent at their discretion- think there are prudent people on the committee
	•	Mark: Objection.
	•	Ani: Questions on the amendment?
	•	Dana: Is this committee even still continuing after this?
	•	Ian: I did most of the work for this committee, I am happy to do more work on this, but am more than happy to let this die tonight.
	•	Jane: Confused, are you asking for more money for more chargers?
	•	Alex: Yeah.
	•	Mike: What would be the structure for deciding this?
	•	Ani: Committee would vote on it
	•	Mark: Motion to previous question on the amendment
	•	Vote- passed. Amendment is included in the bill.
	•	Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is approved.
	•	New Business: SR1213-11: Acknowledging Our History
	•	Ian: University just created committee to look into John Evan's participation in the sand creek massacre. Specifically will look into policy toward Native American people of Colorado and whether or not the railroad he was building financed the university. Brown Unversity had a similar issue. Want to say that we support the efforts of the committee and want to involve NAISA and model this process similarly to what Brown did.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Alexander: What ways do you have in mind to encourage this dialogue?
	•	Ian: Based on Brown, they created a department to create academia focused on this issue going forward.
	•	Mark: Using both a Rawlsian and Nozickian framework, can you discuss this in terms of aspects of social and political philosophy.
	•	Ian: While we weren't the ones who committed these acts, there is knowledge in the world that John Evans was a part of this and Northwestern does nothing to acknowledge this. Don't want our diploma tied up in this.
	•	Good of the Order & Announcements
	•	Ian: Campaign reform is coming back next week with a bill; be ready for that.
	•	Brad: Please take a couple fliers and post them up!
	•	A&O Girl: this weekend is Oscar weekend, A&O is showing a lot of movies
	•	David: 7pm on Monday, the student advisory athlete committee is putting on a talent show, see them do cool stuff!

Senate Adjourned
ASG Senate Minutes
02-27-13

I. Executive Board Reports
	•	Victor: Lakeside Architectural Committee met, facility should be designed in next year or so. Committee to renovate Norris also met, will be lobbying Board of Trustees and starting an awareness campaign for the changes. UBPC had annual presentation last week, presented a number of student priorities from surveying in last quarter, will get back to you soon. About the Student Activities Fee- will create university committee to lay groundwork for student group funding, discussing green fee tonight, and will see how student center support sets out
	•	Motoki (question): Will Norris renovations impact future lobbying for a new student center?
	•	Victor: The process has been that the consultants came up with two options on Garrett Parking Lot, and two options that involved building around the Norris site. In the long term, traffic flow will focus more on the east side of campus, so Norris would be most ideal.
	•	Brad: Amalia has to leave soon, so can I move into 10K?
	•	Ani: Sure
 
	•	[Later]

	•	Brad: Great news on a related front- reached an agreement with the Office of the Provost and student Affairs to free up $10,000 from our operating budget- they'll each take up $5,000 of Eva Jefferson Day.
	•	Carly: Go to coffee chats and talk to your OMs! Want to recognize Harrison as the Senator of the Week for his work last week on his legislation and all the groundwork he did with it.
	•	Lauren: Recognized a lot of groups and I'll be transitioning out once we select my successor this weekend.
	•	Neil: Nothing to add besides what's in my exec board report.
	•	Alex: Working on Norris stuff for Reading Week- things like a relaxation room or 24-hour space- let me know if you have feedback on this. Also working on staff appreciation, looking at timeline in the middle of spring- also reaching out to the Living Wage Campaign and RHA and RCB- let me know if you want to get involved.
	•	Steven: Look online for information on voter registration.
	•	Chris (question): If a Senator was living on campus in a contested district, should they be voting?
	•	Steven: The only district students can vote in are dorms west of Sheridan, not including Elder. If we all vote, it's a big deal.
	•	Motoki: Is the link you provided easily accessible?
	•	Brad: It'll be added to the front page of the ASG website soon.
	•	Ani: On behalf of Hayley, there's a march tomorrow on behalf of Michael Collins at 1:30 at Tech.
	•	Sofia: Also a panel happening tomorrow…
	•	Victor: There's a Q&A tomorrow in the Armadillo Room about the diversity requirement
	•	Ani: Actually next week.
II. Caucus Whip Reports
	•	Ian: Library charger ad hoc is gone, voted to buy six chargers. Rest of money unspent will be rolled back into the pool.
III. General Order: 10K Committee Presentation
	•	Brad: It's your decision to decide what ideas we move forward with and then it goes up to a campus wide vote. Please hold onto your questions until the end.
	•	Brad: We got a lot more submissions than usual, but were limited by a number of concerns, many of them financial. PTI stated that of 14 final ideas, she would only release funding for 4.
	•	Amailia: First idea was for outdoor benches in many of the grassy areas around campus.
	•	Guarav: Another idea was to construct a statue of Willie the Wildcat.
	•	Evan: The next idea we decided on was an outdoor film series- would likely have enough money for 6 films.
	•	Amalia: Picnic tables- totally different from benches! And they can be purple.
	•	Brad: Other ideas that PTI wouldn't fund her half of the $10,000 for, but want to push forward with is Front-end Composting
	•	Amalia: … and Installing hammocks would be another idea to use that we'd only be able to use $5,000.
	•	Brad: To give you an idea of other ideas we wanted but couldn't put on the final list of ideas, here are 8 more ideas that didn't make it
	•	Ian: Expanding WildRoots Garden, purchasing of weights for Blomquist, nap pods, installing a US post-box at Norris, remove obstructions from Ryan Field student section, solar tree, LED bus stop signs that display ETA for shuttles & more computers for tech library.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian H: I'm underwhelmed, were you guys also underwhelmed by this?
	•	Amalia: Had a lot of great ideas that couldn't be reached with 10K, unfortunately.
	•	Ian: Some of the projects also had too long of a timeframe.
	•	Guarav: 10K can't do a whole lot, unfortunately.
	•	Brad: We will go to departments and ask if they'll match if it's one of the ideas that needs more funding.
	•	Motoki: Most of these are summer-friendly, were there any more winter-centric suggestions?
	•	Amalia: Heat lamps came up.
	•	Evan: Also adding more library rooms, but since the library is already undergoing renovations, we decided against pursuing that further.
	•	Petros: What is PTI's argument for building the Wildcat Statue as a way to build community.
	•	Brad: At a lot of other universities they have statues like this- students usually take pictures with statues like these, could contribute to pride and community in that way.
	•	Steven: For releasing these ideas, is there a good way to differentiate between things fully funded and best way to ensure these ideas aren't unfairly biased?
	•	Brad: Haven't thought about it yet, open to ideas.
	•	Sarah: For the picnic tables and benches, how many would we be getting for the price exactly?
	•	Brad: Would just buy as much as we can
	•	Dana: If the hammocks weren't out all the time, who'd manage them?
	•	Brad: Facilities Management, likely.
	•	Patrick: Couldn't the film series be done as a collaboration with someone who usually does them? Like A&O?
	•	Evan: talked to them, might be possibility for collaboration in the future if this idea gets selected.
	•	Sofia: Details on the size of the statue?
	•	Brad: Think life-size.
	•	Motoki: All of these will be implemented by the end of spring quarter?
	•	Brad: With the exception of the statue, all would be done by the end of spring quarter. There's a committee for adding aesthetic elements on campus that would need to review the statue proposal if it's selected.
	•	Sean: Thought everything had to be done by the end of spring quarter?
	•	Brad: Want to get everything done before end of spring quarter, but since there's summer after and no students are here, definite deadline is beginning of fall before students get back.
	•	Lauren M: Feedback on how you all feel about the fast timeline aspect of this process?
	•	Ian: Ensures things get done and ensures the process has finality and that things get enacted quickly.
	•	Michelle: Would PTI override anything we select?
	•	Brad: It's possible.
	•	Mark: Have you spoken to risk management about the hammocks?
	•	Brad: Spoken to facilities, not risk management.
	•	Mark: In past events, risk management had problems with slack lines even a few feet off the ground, might be a problem.
	•	Sean: Would the film series be an event or series?
	•	Guarav: Would happen 5 or 6 times in a single year.
	•	Paul: Motion to remove hammocks from list of recommendations.
	•	Paul: Everyone loves sitting on a new hammock, but after a couple months, they'd get pretty abused, in addition to the risk management issue, I just don't think it's a good idea.
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote on removing hammocks from the list.
	•	Vote- passed. Hammocks are removed.
	•	Ani: Further questions?
	•	Katie: Possibility of combining picnic tables and benches?
	•	Brad: We thought about that and decided we'd split the ideas for Senate to vote on.
	•	Abby: Difference between front and back end composting?
	•	Mark: The composting that you don't see happening when you send your tray back for it to cleaned is back-end composting; front-end composting involves telling students about how they can compost and allowing them to do it themselves.
	•	Brad: Would involve purchasing signage and receptacles for people to do their own composting
	•	Girish: Isn't there a chance that students could mess this up?
	•	Mark: Often when this is introduced elsewhere, there is a learning curve, but after that period of learning, people spread these ideas positively.
	•	Alexander: Motion to remove front end composting.
	•	Alexander: since it's the only $5,000 idea left, it wouldn't be entirely honest of us to put this idea up knowing it'd only get $5,000 while other ideas would $10,000.
	•	Ani: 10K Committee opinion?
	•	Brad: We would indicate the difference and make it clear.
	•	Evan: It would be better to keep it on rather than just taking it off to just take it off so that students aren't underwhelmed by the low number of other ideas.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con on the motion.
	•	Dana (con): really great idea, and unfortunate PTI didn't want to fund it. Should still happen
	•	Steven (con): I agree- this fund was intended to be controlled by students separate from the university's veto power. If students want something, it should signal to the university that students do want something and can make adjustments from there.
	•	Motoki: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- fails. Item remains on the list.
	•	Ani: Further questions?
	•	Connor: Question about picnic tables- would they be wooden like the ones in the picture?
	•	Brad: Presentation picture was a stock picture, will likely be the ones that are out on East Lawn right now.
	•	Alexander: Motion to remove benches and combine picnic tables and benches.
	•	Alexander: I think the two belong together- keeping them separate will cause people to have internal debate between the two.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Mark: What exactly is the difference between the two items?
	•	Ian: Without seating, isn't a picnic table. Complicated issue.
	•	Brad: Practical distinction in that one of the primary obstacles we faced in that many of these would be difficult to implement without conflicting with existing fire lanes
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Motoki (con): I think there's a difference between the two- benches are more couple friendly and picnic tables are more community friendly- people would want one or the other, should give people the option to list how many they want of each.
	•	Angela (pro): Just in terms of the impressions I got from splitting into smaller groups, people think Senate is overly bureaucratic- students will see the differentiation between the two as not making a difference
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- approved. Items are combined.
	•	Mark: Motion to end this.
	•	Vote- approved. Ideas are approved.
IV. General Order: Community and Service Engagement Grant Allocation
	•	Patrick: Gave $100 to Arts in the Community painting a firehouse, gave $200 to SEED to do environmental awareness at an elementary school, also awarded $200 to EMERGE, a leadership program at ETHS that
	•	Chris: To put in context- the committee chose these three ideas and need to confirm them now with Senate.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian: Did all the groups apply for $500?
	•	Patrick: Arts in the Community asked for $100, allocated super well. Most of the other organizations asked for $400 or $500 dollars. A lot of them asked for transportation or food, but sought to fund things focused most on programming. Seemed to make most sense to split the funding between these
	•	Mike: Can provide brief context- found out from admin that most of those who applied for this grant can get money through other sources of funding. Student groups can get other funding in this way.
	•	Chris: They knew when they applied it'd be up to $500 and that Senate would either give a full $500 or a piecemeal allocation
	•	Patrick: Determined this was the most fair way to split up.
	•	Ian: Did you fund any of the applications that included food or transportation?
	•	Chris: No.
	•	Motoki: Accountability measure to make sure what is proposed actually happens?
	•	Mike: Says in the legislation that money not used will be returned to the project pool- no specific accountability measure
	•	Mark: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. Funds are allocated.
V. Old Business: SL1213-23: Parliamentary Body Constitutional Amendment
	•	Lauren: Back again- this removes the Treasurer position and elevates caucus whips to Parliamentary Body.
	•	Ian: Motion to divide the question between removing the treasurer and the elevation of the caucus whips.
	•	Vote- passes. The question has been divided.
	•	Ani: Discussing the Parliamentary Body part of the bill first.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question
	•	Ian: Withdrawn
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Motoki (con): There's a lot in the constitution and code about the parliamentary body. I'm not sure if this set up of caucus is the right way of setting it up- by putting things like this in the constitution makes it harder to change the structure. Not having this in there won't hurt operation of ASG,
	•	Mark (question): If you don't institutionalize caucus whip positions, what meaning does their position hold without this codification.
	•	Ani: Make it into a pro speech
	•	Mark (pro): This is important because it legitimately moves the whips to a larger, more representative role, and their representations needs to be stated explicitly in our guidelines.
	•	Ian (pro): To address Motoki's point, adding in this definition of caucus doesn't make it more rigid- we'd need to change the Senator structure as well, defining the whip's representation only makes sense.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- division
	•	Ay: 30
	•	Nay: 3
	•	Abstentions: 3
	•	Vote- passed. Amendment is implemented into Constitution.
	•	Ani: Moving onto the other half of the question.
	•	Brad: Want to talk about this since this is a bit more controversial than our last change. It's substantial in that it eliminates a position from the executive board. The executive board as a whole is inefficient- the treasurer position as it currently exists is redundant. My position sees all internal operations of ASG- VPs come to me with all requests for money, then David Chi has to approve the money. Would reduce redundancy. All monetary requests have to be approved by Natalie, so that would serve as a check against unrestrained spending. Further, legislation adds in provisions about coming to Senate reporting expenditures.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	April: Why not make the Treasurer a more central part of the conversation.
	•	Brad: It's just redundant- it's asking two people to do the work that one person could do.
	•	Alexander: How to change the details of the EVP position to reflect this?
	•	Brad: Will list it under job description, and additional job responsibilities should be manageable.
	•	Girish: The hardest thing a Treasurer does is manage internal finance, and Brad does that already.
	•	Motoki: A question that came up in caucus was asking whether EVP is doing awesome or Treasurer just doing poorly
	•	Girish: Empirically, treasurer's role has been unclear and unlike other group's treasurers.
	•	Brad: Further redundant.
	•	Victor: given that we're shifting away from MLK and have a shifting up Chief of Staff, Treasurer just isn't a full exec position
	•	April: Why can't we combine FVP and Treasurer?
	•	Girish: I'd have to conduct audits of ASG, would be huge conflict of interest.
	•	Mark: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote division
	•	Ay: 34
	•	Nay: 1
	•	Abstentions: 0
	•	Vote- passed. Amendment is implemented into Constitution.
VI. Old Business: SL1213-22: Parliamentary Body Code Amendment
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- division
	•	Ay: 35
	•	Nay: 0
	•	Abstentions: 1
	•	Vote- passed. Amendment is implemented into Constitution.
VII. Old Business: SR1213-11: Acknowledging Our History
	•	Ian: One of the co-presidents of NAISA is here.
	•	NAISA: This is a resolution in support of a recently circulated petition that provides a statement supporting the logistics of the petition and the ideas behind it. There's been a committee established by the Provost to look into it, but we have records of $200,000 donated directly to Northwestern, translating to about $2 million today. We have at least two historical accounts of him supporting genocide of Native Americans. Provost Linzer refused to allow students and Cheyenne people. Brown university went through a similar process- important for educating people on our history
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Alexander: What specific action do you want to see come from this
	•	NAISA: Body of legislation meant to provide history- in the petition, we ask that the committee be formed and that things be changed on campus to amend institutions named after John Evans be changed. Also institute more support for a Native American Studies Program
	•	Sarah: Whose recommendations are those
	•	NAISA: Put forth by NAISA- the only part that's been acted on by university is formation of a university committee
	•	Sarah: Hoping that this resolution will support those opinions and recommendations?
	•	Ian: Resolution doesn't restate support for the petition completely- primarily wants to push support for resolution of this issue in a similar fashion to other peer-institutions.
	•	Brad: Motion to amend final be it resolved clause to state "to involve students directly in the Committee’s work."
	•	NAISA: Might be too forceful
	•	Brad: Motion rescinded
	•	Lauren: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Legislation is approved.
VIII. New Business: SL1213-26: Campaign Reform Recommendations
	•	Carly: Our committee spent hours over this proposal- made these recommendations to make things more transparent.
	•	Ian: To walk through the legislation, first change would be to elect election commission at beginning of winter quarter. Would change voting to preferential, require 300 signatures . Review election guidelines in spring immediately following election.
	•	Ani: questions?
	•	Chris: Will this at all impact this years election?
	•	Ian: The pre-campaigning stuff won't, but everything else will
	•	Alex L: Don't understand rationale for having Senators attend debates.
	•	Abby: I was on the election commission last year and was disappointed by the turnout. We represent the student body- though we can't mandate the entire student body to go, we have our 51 members and can make sure the Senators inform the student body.
	•	Alex L: Why doesn't Senate elect them outright then?
	•	Abby: We're mandated to spread information as Senators and we're just expanding that idea.
	•	Carly: Not excluding others from going, still encouraging others to attend.
	•	Mike (point of information): how many debates
	•	Abby: 4
	•	Mike: And Senators need to attend all 4?
	•	Abby: Yes
	•	Chris: For your survey results- can you publish the results?
	•	Ian: Don't want to publish the results- decision wasn't wholly based on survey. Also might've received contradictory evidence from survey and can't do both.
	•	Sarah: Can send substitute for debates in your place?
	•	Ian: Yes.
	•	Motoki: Penalty for missing debate?
	•	Mark: Full absence.
	•	Katie: Will exec be mandated to attend
	•	Ian: Can amend to reflect that...
	•	Brad: Where will funding for the baseline materials in this come from?
	•	Ian: Amount won't be much, somewhere around $280- hope to get money from this in our budget and will put it in the budget in the future.
	•	Chris: Majority of suggestions weren't from survey- where did you get ideas to change this?
	•	Ian: COFHE research and former experience with elections.
	•	Brad: Any efforts to solicit feedback from the larger student body given that in some areas excessive use of chalk is suggested?
	•	Ian: Personal experience from members of our constituency that there was an over abundance of chalk.
	•	Brad: Would you be open to having a forum about this to solicit campus opinions about this
	•	Ian: Don't see relevance of having a forum just concerning this.
	•	April: Will the election commission encourage the PR chair to publicize debates more?
	•	Ian: Felt responsibility should be taken up more by election commission to publicize
	•	Katie: Did you say the election commission will be elected next week? What about people outside of Senate?
	•	Ian: Talked to Ani and Brad about this- will publicize as best we can.
	•	Ani: If there are no further questions, this is new business, we'll see it as old business next week.
IX. New Business: SR1213-12: Sustainability Fund - Authorship Presentation
	•	Mark: Legislation has grown irrelevant- here's a presentation about the Green Fund as conditions stand.
	•	Victor: This legislation is important to express to the Board of Trustees that this is important- though this will be heavily amended next week, we hope that this will be something useful for supporting a pilot program. All the of the values are the same, just changing from asking for a student fee to asking the budget office for this.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Motoki: Can you reiterate how this will be used?
	•	Mark: Improving the undergraduate experience through sustainability, could mean a number of things and is very flexible. Decisions will be made by advisory committee
	•	Abby: Selection of committee members for this?
	•	Mark: ASG AVP is permanent co-chair with various other representatives appointed from other groups and an application process. Plenty of ASG representation
	•	Motoki: How much of the campus cares about sustainability to warrant this?
	•	Mark: Not sufficient funding for sustainability initiatives, only one grant.
	•	Brad: Asked UBPC to include a question regarding splitting money- survey information shows students would be comfortable funding a new student center at the same rate.
	•	Victor: Also sufficient amount of demand from other sources.
X. Good of the Order & Announcements
	•	Ian: Come to the armadillo room next Thursday fi you have any feedback on the diversity requirement
	•	April: Please come out for tomorrow's march for Michael Collins
	•	Sean: BJ Novak tickets still on sale, followed by Skyfall screening
	•	Gio: MGC banquet.
	•	Lauren: Next Wednesday- we're having our 14th annual comedy beatdown, tickets are $5.
	•	Mike: For garage sale- will bring in munchkins next week if I get 40 more responses before 12:30.

Senate Adjourned
ASG Senate Minutes
03-06-13

I. Executive Board Reports
	•	Brad: A couple things- Victor is stuck in DC unable to get a flight home because of the snow. 10K publicity will go out next week, with voting starting on Sunday until the following Sunday. We'll also be meeting with the new Dean of Students, Todd Adams. Also talking about restarting New Student Center Initiative to gauge student opinion about making a student fee for it.
	•	David: Three announcements- first, Cab Corner launched last week and works as an online service to facilitate taxicab sharing when students travel to the airport. Second thing- food truck festival confirmed with Spoon for first Thursday next quarter- they do great PR. I'll let Casey talk about the third thing
	•	Casey: I gave a presentation a few weeks back about BookSwap- should be launching tonight. Please post your books on the site. The more books that get posted, the larger the effect on the community.
	•	David: To emphasize, we really want you to post your books. This can be a powerful tool- it's most efficient if students are buying and selling from each other. You can post your books now, the site will be beautified tonight.
	•	Lauren: Tonight is my last Senate- we recognized three student groups: Project RISHI & Cirque de NU got T-status and Students for Justice in Palestine got B-status
	•	Girish: Also my last meeting, transitioning out
	•	Steven: Nothing new to report. Things are going as planned, registering people for Evanston voting.
	•	Brad: Remembered the last thing I was gonna say- Board of Trustees are in town- we'll be going to a meeting with them tomorrow and will report on what they discuss. Will talk about the New Student Center- hopefully something will come of that.
	•	Brandon: Nothing much new to report, just working on code, guideline and constitution review depending on what exactly is passed tonight.
	•	Ani: SGAC will be meeting next week to determine student group seats.
II. Special Order: Kelly Schaefer, Executive Director of Norris University Center
	•	Kelly: Came from IIT and before that DePaul. Want to be a partner for making things happen for students. Want to also talk about New Student Center- lots of concepts have developed, the student life BoT meeting tomorrow is a big hurdle coming up. Have been talking with SGC and members of the administration about various initiatives going forward
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Alex Lower: Can you give us an idea of what the new student center will look like?
	•	Kelly: Very conceptual, but from a campus plan, will be connected to campus in a really cool way. The architects are considering us as cutting edge in our ideas. We're trying to connect more with academics in terms of Norris, and want to bring the learning experience to Norris. We have some pretty big issues to contend with, including the loading dock.
	•	Brad: She can't point to a specific design because it's all very rough at this point.
	•	Lauren: Best way to get in touch with you?
	•	Kelly: My number is 773.329.7531- you can text or call me. I'm on the third floor of Norris next to the alumni room. My email is kelly.schafer@northwestern.edu, I don't like voicemail.
	•	Mike: When Norris is open 24-hours next week, will that be used as a test of 24-hour spaces?
	•	Kelly: That was the initial intention, but the week that we're holding it will be different from most weeks in that it'll have more programming and it'll be later in the quarter. We try to think about health concerns when deciding whether or not to keep Norris open 24/7- want to make sure we're encouraging spaces like these without encouraging bad study habits and staying up all night.
	•	Mike: Would you ever consider extending the service of the campus/Evanston loop to match Norris staying open 24/7?
	•	Kelly: SafeRide can't extend, haven't gotten a reply from shuttles. Not my department and it's a funding year, might have to look at the issue later for sweeping changes like that.
	•	Kyreese: Will student staff be required to work overnight during 24/7 hours?
	•	Kelly: No, we have a full time staff that will stay overnight and keep the center open.
	•	David: Some of my committee members talked to you about Norris mini courses- how do you see mini courses changing and will there be any changes in pricing to make it more accessible to students?
	•	Kelly: Student led seminars have come up- we'd want to make sure that student instructors are qualified. Also wouldn't want to pay them less than regular instructors. Want to also open these seminars up to students in lower SESs. Been talking about a lot of these things
	•	April: Can you talk about the construction of the new student center?
	•	Kelly: A lot more glass- more wide open spaces. Don't want to make it more than 4 floors so that it's more centralized. In the conceptual drawings we're looking at, there'll be a student organization porch/collaborative area. Student orgs have changed to work better in environments like this- would be mostly glass.
	•	Chris: When construction begins, how long will it take and how will it affect students?
	•	Kelly: Depends if we can get money all at once or not- could affect timeline. Also depends on campus master-plan and other buildings under construction. Would likely move to another building during construction.
	•	Ani: Thanks for coming in!
III. Special Order: Social Inequalities & Diversities Requirement Presentation & Discussion
	•	Sofia: This will have huge implications if passed and many students have questions about it, prompting this presentation. [Presentation Linked Above]
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	David: Why didn't we compare with COFHE schools?
	•	Hayley: We will wanted to compare with schools we've been comparing ourselves with lately.
	•	Alexander: I don't see religion as one of the positionalities looked at?
	•	Sofia: I brought this up as well, we're still working on this and it'll be included if it's determined to be a priority.
	•	Alex: Wouldn't picking a class time ensure people will be there?
	•	Sofia: This is outside of the class, it's like a discussion section.
	•	David: Is there any thought into making sure groups are deliberately diverse somehow?
	•	Jazzy: Yes- you can't just sign up with your friends, and moderators will be included in the groups.
	•	Motoki: You said this committee is formed by faculty, staff & students? What will be the backgrounds of these professors?
	•	Sofia: The actual make-up of the committee is quite diverse.
	•	Sarah: Will those managing these sessions be able to discuss more sensitive issues?
	•	Sofia: Yes, they will be trained to do so.
	•	Motoki: Do you know when the COFHE research will get done?
	•	Hayley: Soon! I want to stress that it's unusual that this proposal has been shared with students at all- this is unheard of as far as proposals go.
	•	Tori: Are you trying to create new classes or implement this curriculum into existing classes?
	•	Sofia: A little of both, depending on specific factors in each school.
[Breakout Sessions]
	•	Hayley: Ok, bringing it back… other questions?
	•	Alex: Currently, how would this class be graded?
	•	Hayley: That's yet to be determined, but there are a lot of cool options on the table- right now we're just trying to get it through faculty senate and get it approved. If any of the groups discussed any good ideas about that, let us know!
	•	Alexander: Shouldn't be the kind of grading where students lose sight of the purpose, yet shouldn't cause students to stress out.
	•	Henry: I think it should be heavily participation based.
	•	Mark: Have to disagree- not everyone's super comfortable speaking up in discussions.
	•	Alex: If you grade it entirely on participation, you could be very close minded and just be vocal.
	•	Sofia: A lot of professors grade participation a bit differently based on the quality of discussion as well, so hopefully that problem would be avoided.
	•	Jesse: If you enter the class close-minded, you should be able to do well- not ok to force someone to change their opinions.
	•	Jazzy: I get what you're saying- there's an assumption we're trying to change. We want people to bring their beliefs to the table and discuss them.
	•	Abby: Will there be any sort of personal assessment before and after the course?
	•	Hayley: That's another topic of conversation and will be something to consider down the road.
	•	Sarah: Was going to say something about participation and closed/open mindedness- there's a difference between being close minded and open- if you won't listen to anyone, that's different from having an opinion that's less popular.
	•	David: Have you worked to engage the people who show up to these meetings?
	•	Hayley: We've submitted this draft, gone to faculty members- we've been working to engage students we haven't heard from
	•	David: It's important to talk to students who aren't having these conversations. That's difficult, but if there's any way that we can seek these people in a sort of focus group environment, maybe through a fireside, it's really important.
	•	Mark: You're presupposing that majority opinion is relevant in a conversation about minority rights. Ian brought up a good point in our breakout group that I'm going to make him say again.
	•	Ian: We might learn about a new culture in a class, but we don't have anything that analyzes our current ability and status and how that affects our ability to function. We don't have that now and the curriculum component will provide that.
	•	Sofia: The requirement is very much about how students view their environment in the context of their experiences.
	•	Motoki: Are you going to say that students support this or encourage them to collect student support
	•	Hayley: We're working with the Provost, it's how we're getting the voice of students. They've reached out to us a lot about it. We're having a Q&A session tomorrow with administrators at 6pm in the Armadillo Room. If you want to make sure faculty hears you directly, come to that!
IV. General Order: Financial VP Confirmation
	•	Girish: As we touched upon earlier, me and Lauren are both done with our terms. We had a selection committee made up of several individuals- we ended up nominating Siddiq for the position.
	•	Siddiq: It's an honor to be nominated for this position. To give some background, I was one of those freshman who went to every event, started as an AE for the SAFC in my sophomore year- been advising groups for quite some time- it's basically helping to form campus culture. Being in the FVP position will allow me to work with these organizations in a better way. Want to upgrade our price index, digitize everything with Google Drive. Also want to get faculty and student advisors on the same page.
	•	Ani: Opening the floor for questions.
	•	Ian: What other major leadership positions will you have over the next year?
	•	Siddiq: Since the FVP is such a large commitment, I won't have any other big positions.
	•	April: Will you encourage your AEs to go to many of the events as possible?
	•	Siddiq: I love going to the events- you can learn a lot from them. I would like to urge AEs to go to as many events as they can, but they're only required to go to their own groups events that are funded through the SAF. There are so many events, it's sometimes just not possible to require them to go to more.
	•	Mark: In comparison to Girish, what are your strengths and weaknesses as relevant to your role as FVP?
	•	Siddiq: Girish was very good at starting new initiatives, I want to sustain that. As a con, Girish is very motivated and likes to take on responsibilities by himself- want to delegate more to the committee.
	•	Patrick: Favorite A&O show?
	•	Siddiq: I liked Lupe Fiasco.
	•	David: Major reforms to the funding system seem inevitable- what are some of the priorities going forward regarding how we allocate money through the SAF?
	•	Siddiq: The pool is growing substantially- we want to target co-sponsorships, and also want to look at how much groups have to give back to the SAF when the accept money.
	•	Sofia: Given your strengths and weaknesses, what added direction do you want to give to the position?
	•	Siddiq: A good move in the right direction is getting the advisors to be more of an asset to student organizations so that they can do their jobs well. We, as students, might not be here after 4 years, but faculty advisors will.
	•	Mark: How will you work with the sustainability committee to make student group events more sustainable?
	•	Siddiq: Many student groups have done small things on their own to move toward more sustainable methods, but would definitely be interested in talking about more organized efforts with the sustainability community.
	•	Sarah: What do you think that you would bring to the exec board?
	•	Siddiq: I will be hearing about a lot of student group issues- I stand as a representative of student group concerns and issues
	•	Ani: Moving into a debate/endorsement period.
	•	X: Something abundantly clear from his answers is how much he cares about student groups, which is the most important thing someone in this position can have
	•	X: I endorse this candidate since he actually likes going to student group events, I also like how he wants to work with advisors.
	•	X: I really got to see Siddiq grow- he is probably one of the best people to look at both sides of the argument. I don't need to talk about how dedicated he is to going to student group events. He truly cares about every group he works with.
	•	X: Siddiq has been my account executive since the fall. I've dealt with several AEs in my time here- most want to make sure your group is doing well- Siddiq is different in that he wants to bring a critical element to programming and discussing ways to make student group events better.
	•	Alexander: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Siddiq is confirmed as the next Financial Vice President.
	•	Girish: Thanks for a great year- people care about what ASG does, administrators certainly do, even if students don't seem to. Thanks again everyone!
V. General Order: Student Groups VP Confirmation
	•	Lauren: Like Girish said, we met this past weekend with a selection committee to select my successor- want to nominate Neel Lalkiya.
	•	Neel: I'm a junior chemistry major- I joined the SGC in April of last year and worked with a wide variety of groups. That gave me a wide variety of experiences dealing with different kinds of groups. The SGC should improve on meeting with groups- it's important for the GEs to meet with groups. It's important for the SGVP especially to ensure groups learn about funding, training, SOFO, CSI, administration and other parties to ensure that events happen.
	•	Ani: Opening the floor for questions.
	•	David: As Kelly Schafer mentioned, a big priority for going forward is changing recognition processes- how do you see this changing over the next year under your leadership?
	•	Neel: A lot of groups don't need ASG recognition necessarily, but still think it's important for them to go through ASG for support. There're a lot of groups that have specific interests- the New Student Groups Committee will focus on helping any group on campus with resources. It's a good direction to go in so that we don't have to deal with 600 groups but need to make sure groups are still getting the resources they need.
	•	Mark: Same two questions as before.
	•	Neel: Sustainability- it's important that GEs enforce this and can work with your committee to ensure this happens. Comparing myself to Lauren- she did the same thing as Girish in taking everything on her back- Lauren improved the entire process. It's very important to subdivide responsibilities between GEs. Now that the framework is set up we need to refine it and divide responsibility.
	•	Ian: Can you describe your current relationship with the FVP and what you'll do with that relationship?
	•	Neel: I just met Siddiq, but will definitely work with him closely going forward. Important for GEs and AEs to work together. It'll be important for us to hold occasional joint meetings to enhance communication.
	•	Sarah: What do you think is the importance of Senate in your role?
	•	Neel: Senate and Senators are an important asset- need student feedback in the decisions we make and need to know what sorts of groups need what types of resources to succeed.
	•	Alex: There are more and more groups applying and requesting money, and the responsibilities of the SGC are also changing, how do you plan to address these changes?
	•	Neel: Our funding process is becoming more involved and I want to ensure GEs are becoming more involved as part of that. Need to implement GEs in that process to make sure groups aren't confused.
	•	Brandon: If selected, what do you see as your contribution to the executive board?
	•	Neel: Hope to be the expert of B and T status groups on campus and ensure that groups are collaborating on different areas on the executive board. It's a symbiotic relationship.
	•	Ani: Moving into a debate/endorsement period.
	•	X: I'm glad Neel applied to this position and I'm glad to be recommending him. This position has a steep learning curve and needs a quick learner. Neel is really strong in being social/approachable, he also needs to be comfortable in a leadership position. He cares very deeply about the student group community and I couldn't have asked for anyone better to apply.
	•	X: Agree with Lauren, he's great on the committee, always is very considerate and respectful
	•	X: Neel will do a great job with determining SGC empirical decisions.
	•	Mark: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Neel is confirmed as the next Student Groups Vice President.
	•	Brad: Thanks to Girish and Lauren- they've been invaluable to the organization. They've brought perspectives that have contributed a lot.
	•	Lauren: I've been through a lot of Senates, and you guys are probably my favorite. As a transfer student, I'm able to compare to a lot, and it's been awesome. Thanks for a great last couple of years.
VI. General Order: Election Commission Selection
	•	Ani: Now opening the floor for the Campus-Wide Election Commission. Seven spots to fill.
	•	Brad: I nominate Jason.
	•	Jason: I accept.
	•	Henry: I nominate Brandon.
	•	Brandon: I respectfully decline.
	•	Sarah: I nominate Abby.
	•	Abby: I accept.
	•	Brad: I nominate Petros.
	•	Petros: I accept.
	•	Abby: I nominate Dana.
	•	Dana: I accept.
	•	Brad: I nominate Alexander.
	•	Alexander: I accept.
	•	Paul: I nominate Henry.
	•	Henry: I respectfully decline.
	•	Tori: I nominate myself.
	•	Ian: I nominate Motoki.
	•	Motoki: I respectfully decline.
	•	Brad: I nominate Sarah.
	•	Sarah: I respectfully decline.
	•	Motoki: I nominate Brad.
	•	Brad: I respectfully decline.
	•	Abby: I nominate Alex Lower.
	•	Alex: I accept.
	•	Ani: Please come up and introduce yourselves.
	•	Jason: Did election commission last year, it was a lot of fun.
	•	Abby: Also served on election commission and was on the campaign reform ad-hoc. These are the people who will be leading us, campus needs to be aware of the candidates and the election commission is important to making that happen
	•	Petros: A good election is critical to a good ASG.
	•	Dana: Technically on the election commission right now through Rules. Want to be as involved as possible with making sure elections happen successfully.
	•	Alexander: Will be first election I've seen and would like to get involved, but great at learning on the job.
	•	Tori: Have worked on two elections, never want to do it again. Will be good to work from the other end.
	•	Alex: Want to make the elections exciting and engaging, but not obtrusive. Brad was annoying, not sure if that's good or bad democracy.
	•	Ani: Opening the floor for questions.
	•	Chris: How do you all feel about the campaign reform recommendations?
	•	Abby: I helped write them, like them, maybe biased.
	•	Petros: Like them- they even the playing field and makes the election fairer.
	•	Dana: Generally in favor but interested to see debate tonight on it.
	•	Alexander: Don't go far enough in leveling playing field, but good start. Getting rid of run-offs is a good idea.
	•	Tori: Lot of merit in the proposals, but interested to hear debate.
	•	Alex: Would like to look into the line about having Senators required to be at the debates, but in support.
	•	Jason: Only read them briefly, but generally approve.
	•	April: Since you're responsible for advertising, can you talk about what you would do to ensure people attend debates?
	•	Petros: Good to get people personally and talk to them about the election.
	•	Dana: I agree- more about making the debates a worthwhile experience rather than accosting them with PR.
	•	Alexander: Important to place at strategic locations and getting in people's faces
	•	Tori: Utilizing Senator connections is important to make a more personal message. Also important to sell the entire election.
	•	Alex: Getting student groups involved with the debates would be a good idea.
	•	Jason: Having a very active social media prescience would get a wider audience.
	•	Abby: Making personal connections and utilizing Senators is important- maybe taking clips of the debate could be utilized.
	•	Patrick: Have any of you met with or expressed support with anyone running and can you promise that you will remain impartial? Second part of question- will you take the hardline when dealing with election violations?
	•	Dana: Haven't met with anybody and don't plan on doing so. I'm completely comfortable with violations- they're there for a reason, every candidate goes into the same game, rules should all apply.
	•	Alexander: Met with Benison, not sure what he's running for… as far as violations are concerned, I'm a bit of a hard-ass, I'll only give people the same amount of chances as any other candidate.
	•	Tori: Been approached by several candidates and made it clear I'm not endorsing anyone. I take the hardline as a member of SAFC, so I have no problems being hard on violations.
	•	Alex: Got emailed by Benison, didn't respond, seemed sketchy. Very important to make sure candidates know about guidelines.
	•	Jason: Haven't met with candidates, take violations seriously.
	•	Abby: Met with someone considering running, didn't endorse them. It'll be the job of the commission to sit down with candidates and ensure they know what they're getting into.
	•	Petros: Met with candidates, endorsed no one. Answered questions, but not endorsed anything on platform, and obviously would not do that.
	•	Senator: Motion to white ballot.
	•	Vote- passed. Members are approved to the election commission.
VII. Old Business: SL1213-26: Campaign Reform Recommendations
	•	Ian: Hope you've all read this- two amendments made since last week are in red. First amendment: clarifying Code so that it's clear that the Rules Committee impeaches candidates. Second amendment: requires that exec attend debates as well as Senators.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Harrison: Concerns about preferential voting being confusing?
	•	Ian: We believe that preferential voting is superior because it eliminates runoffs. A good ballot design will mitigate confusions that might arise- Ethan can probably do this. Candidates will be ranked and it'll be clear when we put it onto the ballot itself.
	•	Henry: Would you be opposed to having the names come up in a random order? And no preference option?
	•	Ian: Yes to random order. For no preference- we could write the ballot to change rankings.
	•	Chris: How did you come up with the amount of resources to allocate?
	•	Ian: Had these specifications in the guidelines previously and used judgment in making other specifications.
	•	Tori: Given that there are pretty strict flyering and chalking zones, is there anything here to stop candidates from flyering and chalking outside these areas?
	•	Ian: It's already a rule under CSI regulations  that you can't do so.
	•	Henry: Logic behind increasing number of signatures?
	•	Ian: Looked at peer institutions- figured it wasn't unreasonable.
	•	Ian: Move to pass the amendments outlined in red.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Amendments are implemented into the bill.
	•	Brad: Motion to divide the question between before section 5 and after section 5.
	•	Brad: My reasoning is that this addresses two fundamentally different things, setting up the campaign and executing it. It's possible for one to pass and no the other and it would work because the two things are fundamentally different. When Steven brought this up the distinction was between determining the rules between before and after the election period.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con on dividing the question.
	•	Brad (con): This is a good piece of legislation overall. Everything above 5 is great- I have a number of problems with the execution of the campaign, both from ASG's perspective and my experience running as a candidate. Doesn't state where funding for materials comes from- 50 sticks of chalk isn't enough, chalk was meant to be more sustainable and need more- student group resource center doesn't work in the way the legislation suggests, would have to make a SOFO account for each candidate. Putting the monetary allocation at $150 doesn't account for inflation. Important to have a maximum number of signatures so campaigning isn't started earlier
	•	Alexander (question): how large will the chalk be?
	•	Abby: Big pieces.
	•	Mark (pro): These sound like a lot of good amendments- why did you not approach us in the last week?
	•	Ian (pro): An oversight not to cap signatures. Inflation is easily dealt with, changes in SAF for fees could change SAF drastically. We can up the chalk, but not in line with such a large increase,
	•	Ian: Motion to amend change signatures to be between 300 and 350.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Amendment is implemented in the bill.
	•	Ian: Motion to extend Senate by one hour.
	•	Vote- passed. Senate is extended.
	•	Mike: Motion to amend that Senators must be present in all debates- want to amend to half of the debates.
	•	Mike: Want to see this amended because, while I realize Senators should attend, many may be bogged down with midterms, but also want to see some teeth to make sure Senators definitely show up
	•	Katie: It's the responsibility of the Senator to be informed on the candidates and bring this information back to constituents.
	•	Tori (pro): Student group senators have other commitments, first two or three weeks are transition periods and making people choose between debates and their groups is unfair
	•	Alex: Motion to amend the amendment from at least half to at least 3 of the 4
	•	Alex: Withdrawn
	•	Dana (con): Important for us as part of the student government to be a part of these elections and be able to provide as good as answers to questions as possible. This is a good way to ensure everyone has that information.
	•	Morgan (pro): If we require that Senators be at every debate, it'll discourage others from coming.
	•	Paul (pro): In addition, forcing Senators to go to these debates makes it look like something that these aren't something Senators want to go to.
	•	Mark (con): Nobody's forcing them, you'll just get absences, and it's in your best interest.
	•	Abby (con): Wanted to point out that it's the job of the election commission to make sure these debates are publicized .
	•	Vote- division.
	•	Ay- 14
	•	Nay- 9
	•	Abstentions- 6
	•	Vote- passes. Amendment is implemented in the bill.
	•	Abby: Motion to amend- add executive board as required  to attend debates
	•	David: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. Amendment is implemented in the bill.
	•	Brad: Motion to amend- want to remove limitation on chalk.
	•	Brad: 50 sticks of chalk is too little- amendment would still provide cap on chalk, but more than 50. Provides more flexibility.
	•	Motoki (question): Ideal number of chalk sticks?
	•	Brad: Depends on individual campaign strategy
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con.
	•	Alexander (con): Already been over this, will need less chalk because chalking zones are now limited to flyering zones.
	•	Ian (pro): This seems reasonable- with the fact that chalking is now restricted to flyering zones, should be no problem with removing this restriction.
	•	Abby (pro): I agree.
	•	Mark: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- passed. Amendment is implemented in the bill.
	•	Mark: Motion to amend- want to add that Senators who fail to attend fewer than half of the debates shall be subject to immediate disciplinary review
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. Amendment is implemented in the bill.
	•	Brad: Motion to amend- motion to revert back to the original allocation of the ASG activities fee for that given year.
	•	Brad: for those of you that don't know the way the SAF works- it's called the Associated Student Government activities fee- asked a few years ago to increase with inflation and with the cost of living.
	•	Ian question: Do you think that changing the student activities fee in talks would affect this
	•	Brad: Won't change for at least a year, can determine if this happens
	•	Ani: moving into pro/con
	•	Ian (con): election commission can change to make sure it reflects inflation, helpful to change number for people looking at the guidelines who may not be familiar with the structure of the SAF..
	•	Alex: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- division.
	•	Ay: 11
	•	Nay: 9
	•	Abstentions: 7
	•	Vote- passes. Amendment is implemented in the bill.
	•	Mark: Motion to suspend the rules and move up both pieces of new business immediately.
	•	Vote- passed. Moving onto SR1213-13 and SL1213-27.
[Later]
	•	Brad: Motion to amend to strike the line that says an account in the student groups resources be credited with $24.
	•	Brad: Striking on the feasibility of the implementation- would need to open a SOFO account for a group to make this feasible.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Ian (con): It'd be easy to implement, ASG exec members have printer codes, shouldn't be working out logistics here
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- fails. Amendment is not implemented into the bill.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question on the legislation
	•	Ian: Just stated why this should go to a vote- other issues to address, the proper forum to address this was over the past week. This is a waste of time, this should be brought up to the election commission.
	•	Ani: pro/con
	•	Brad (con): Three remaining points, willing to set aside two about website templates and [something else]. Don't want to set aside how all of these campaign materials would be funded- nothing in the legislation clarifies this. Would have to fund things from Senate project pool this year, central operating budget next year.
	•	Ian (pro): Executive board is late on setting budget already, this money should come from the project pool for now.
	•	David: Motion to suspend the rules and state that the Senate project pool be used to fund this for the current election year
	•	Vote- passed. Amendment is implemented in the bill.
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is approved.
VIII. New Business: SR1213-13: Honoring Ricky Byrdsong
	•	Paul: I'm here to introduce a concept- Ricky Byrdsong was the first and only African American basketball coach at Northwestern. He was a symbol and brought the team to a considerable point of national recognition. He died on a shooting spree motivated by racial hatred. He was shot in Skokie a year after his coaching position was terminated. This situation isn't well known, but there are many books and articles about this in the context of social justice. We think it matters because the way you set the tone for a community is how you take a stand for issues like this.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Jesse: Why now? Was there an event that brought this to people's attention?
	•	Paul: I knew about this in grade school, but it shouldn't be any later
	•	Alexander: What would be a more appropriate way to address this?
	•	Paul: Don't know, but wouldn't be opposed to some sort of statue or plaque
	•	Petros: Can you clarify the relevance of AON plc to all this
	•	Paul: Corporation in Chicago that Ricky was a part of- sponsors the race against hate every year
	•	Mark: Time sensitivity on this?
	•	Paul: Would like to pass this tonight
	•	Ayanna: With respect to the why now, due to the events that have happened now, there's a growing tension. We'll still be fragmented, but if the university is looking to commemorate things like Willie, why not commemorate this?
	•	Tori: Motion to make this old business.
	•	David: This is great, would like to vote on this, but spoke to a bunch of administrators who believed this death was handled gracefully. No objection to the bill, but would be helpful to look into this and make sure everything is as it actually is. Just looking for more information.
	•	Mark (question): I'd understand if this was more accusatory, can you explain further
	•	David: Just want time to get more information.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con.
	•	Jazzy (con): University had a memorial for Ricky Byrdsong.
	•	Paul (con): The fact that we had to dig back 13 years to figure out how this was handled is the problem. We don't want to make this about the administrator or Northwestern
	•	Jesse (pro): Agree with David- why I asked why specifically now, doesn't seem like time sensitive issue.
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is old business.
	•	April: I think this issue is very important to my constituency, it's all we've been talking about for weeks, and I do have a connection to this and want to celebrate and commemorate his legacy.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Legislation is approved.
IX. New Business: SL1213-27: LENDing a Hand
	•	Guarav: LEND is a microfinance organization with an 18 student staff and an 8 member board of directors consisting of community entrepreneurs. We provide services like microloans- want to serve aspiring entrepreneurs that don't have access to secure financing for a business. Many of these individuals haven't had formal education, but have a craft or skill that is marketable. We have a 100% payback rate and that's admirable. We've received more requests than usual and we've gotten a lot of attention with Evanston establishments. ASG was instrumental to starting LEND, though we're recognized under the Farley Center- we still have the money ASG gave us, it's still being given out as new loans.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Alex: Do you charge interest on your loans?
	•	Guarav: Yes- a 9% interest rate with a 50% refund rate on interest as an incentive for paying back on time. Given the principle of the loans, interest doesn't come out to more than a few hundred dollars.
	•	Jesse: Do those you service have any incentive to pay loans back?
	•	Guarav: Have a strict approval process and get to know people we're lending to, make sure that if we lend to people they'll pay back
	•	Mark: Can you talk more about the things you've funded?
	•	Guarav: First provided a loan to a barbershop for cosmetic renovations. Had become a community centerpiece and used to renovate the entirety of the shop. Second loan was to a painting contractor to purchase a vehicle. Third loan was for jewelry boutique owner. Fourth was to expand a fitness studio. Fifth loan was for ex-offender handyman to buy a vehicle. Sixth loan was for a bridal boutique. We have $19,000 in requested funds that fit the criteria of what we seek to do.
	•	Ian: Do you think it's appropriate that money allocated for student activities be allocated for philanthropic purposes?
	•	Guarav: Everyone that's had some hand in LEND has gotten a lot from it- really a great learning opportunity.
	•	Siddiq: How many members does LEND have?
	•	Guarav: 18, so we've doubled size and believe the group will grow further
	•	Mark: Where else are you seeking funds and have you sought any reciprocity in playing back?
	•	LEND Girl: Looked to groups like global giving, reached out to banks in the area.
	•	Guarav: Reaching out to other prominent organizations in the area as well.
	•	Senator: Do you have many overhead costs?
	•	Guarav: very little- we're volunteer and only costs are associated with capital improvements.
	•	Siddiq: How much in project pool?
	•	Ani: Around $5400- rolls over at the end of spring
	•	Brad: That includes the $1000 from NU day at the united center
	•	Mike (point of information): bring us down to $2400 after allocation?
	•	Ani: Yes
	•	Siddiq: Any events on campus to engage the northwestern community?
	•	Guarav: Event with NCDC- doing microfinance on international scale. Other stuff.
	•	Abby: Motion to extend Senate by 30 minutes
	•	Vote- passed.
X. Old Business: SR1213-12: Sustainability Fund: Authorship Presentation
	•	Mark: This says we support this action.
	•	Jesse: What will this money be used for and why isn't the university subsidizing this?
	•	Brad: This money is for students to create student initiatives. Would allow for funding of things that the university wouldn't usually fund.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question on the amendments
	•	Vote- passed. Amendments are implemented in the bill.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question on the bill
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is approved.
XI. Emergency Legislation/New Business: SL1213-28: Norris Exam Relief
	•	Mark: Motion to make this old business
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is now old business.
	•	Motoki (question): Anything else we can fund besides the slippers?
	•	Ian: Other things, but we can control branding this way.
	•	Brad: Senate doesn't need to follow what SGC and SAFC set for funding guidelines, the project pool is separate from these requirements.
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is approved.
XII. Good of the Order & Announcements
	•	Katie: NCDC's Dialogue Event at 7pm in Harris 107!
	•	Abby: Next Thursday, Alpha Phi is hosting their philanthropy for hot cookie bar!
	•	Senator: Tomorrow 5-6pm is ethnic studies panel and NAISA's project to getting more Native American students.
	•	Paul: Drag show in a week and a half. You should all come!
	•	Ian: Tomorrow at 6pm in the armadillo room is more talk back about the diversity requirement!
	•	Connor: Spread the word to end the word- buy wristbands!

Senate Adjourned
ASG Senate Minutes
03-13-13

I. Executive Board Reports
	•	Victor: Submitted proposal for sustainability fund- office will consider it and I'll get back to you about in a couple months. PLI is having it's last meeting this week.
	•	Brad: If anyone's interested in getting involved with new student center stuff, let me know.
	•	Alex:  Besides my exec board report, thanks to Natalie. We will have therapy dogs on Saturday from 2-4 in the wildcat room! Come if you want to de-stress!
	•	Alexander: Puppies or big dogs
	•	Alex: Bigger dogs, don't want to hurt puppies!
	•	Siddiq: 2 non-senator positions open on the SAFC! If you know anyone interested or who would be good for the position, please forward it along.
	•	Neel: Recruitment! Will be losing half of the committee next year, will be sending out an application soon.
	•	Steven: Voter registration deadline has passed, we'll be finishing up plans for get out the vote stuff for the week after spring break. Will be having forums for the candidates tomorrow, please read my exec board report. Will be resigning soon. Free food, go there! Gun control outreach committee met, set deadline for sending letter out as first Wednesday back after spring break. Loyola and DePaul are behind it, trying to get in contact with U Chicago.
	•	Mark: Any sense for how many students registered to vote
	•	Steven: Don't have that info right now, but will be getting that information soon.
	•	Alexander: Why is this forum super important for elections
	•	Steven: Only opportunity to hear from both of the candidates, would be good to have students there to ask questions.
	•	David: A few things- CabCorner launched a couple weeks ago, will be ramping up publicity right around now- exclusive to Northwestern students and has utility for students going to and from the airport. Please forward a listserv blast after senate about it. BookSwap is officially live- please sell your textbooks using BookSwap! People won't use this if there aren't books there, so please use 10 minutes to post your books. Will also be doing another food truck festival with Spoon the first Thursday back.
	•	Alexander: Tried to use CabCorner the other night, but seems overly specific, and will only show those taking a cab from my street. Want a broader selection.
	•	David: Will communicate that- can't unilaterally change site since it's contracted out, but will see if it's feasible to implement.
	•	Ethan: I'M BACK! And BookSwap is launched. Will fix BookSwap, looks kinda nice, let me know what you think, shoot me an email, will be working more on the ASG website over Spring Break. Good luck on finals and have fun on Spring Break!
	•	Carly: The mentorship program is live, we're going to have a bunch of new student groups senators coming in, let me know if you want to get involved. Want to recognize Abby and Ian Coley as Senators of the Week for getting Election changes passed
	•	Mark: Open meeting of Sustainability Committee on Friday. I also have legislation tonight- please read it and vote for it. Divestment is being seen by university. Working on voluntary carbon market for university to incentivize responsible purchasing by the university.
	•	Ani: This is Brandon and I's penultimate Senate, will be making more changes as we leave our term for the next senate leadership team. Student group senators, keep in mind that if you're planning to serve another term and you get selected by the SGAC, the speaker will be meeting with you and your exec board to lay out responsibilities and expectations. Should hopefully improve accountability and transparency going forward.
	•	Mark: Requirements for running for a parliamentary body position?
	•	Brandon: Must have served as Senator for four consecutive Senates at any time.
II. Special Order: Director of Transportation Confirmation
	•	Alex: Selected Hayley Hinkle for Director of Transportation position
	•	Hayley: I'm a freshman that's been on student life since fall quarter, getting involved because I have background with transportation, will work as connection between university services and ASG.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Alexander: Point of Contact in administration?
	•	Hayley: Bernie Foster, other administrators that deal with shuttles
	•	Mark: This position includes oversight over both SafeRide and Shuttles, right?
	•	Alex: Yeah, those are the two main things.
	•	Ani: In line for endorsement period.
	•	X: Met with administration a few weeks ago, very happy to work with administrators.
	•	X: Also want to endorse Hayley, she's a really good pick.
	•	X: Definitely has what it takes.
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- passed. Hayley is confirmed as new Student Life Director of Transportation.
III. Special Order: Charles Stephens, ZipCar Presentation
	•	Charles: Thanks to all of you for the opportunity, will try to be quick. Zip car is a car sharing organization- it's a fleet of cars all over the world shared by millions of people. Operate in 20 major metropolitan areas, 2 continents, 30 campuses. Works fairly basically, but requires some explanation. Do a driving and credit check- once approved, make a reservation, wave card in front of windshield, drive away. Probably was the 4th or 5th person using my car that I used to drive here today. Launched in Chicago in 2006, largest car sharing company in Chicago, 550 cars in Chicago-land area, partnered with University in many different ways. In Evanston, we have 10 different cars in 7 locations. Good mix for right now. Parking is difficult, but trying to get closer to campus. If we can move forward in a 'Spirit of Partnership' can extend opportunity to use ZipCar to 18-20 year olds. Doing something at Northwestern would not be our first rodeo- 81% coverage of USNWR Top 15. This really works on campuses- spoke to John Cowgill, told me about how he gets $500 of parking tickets and wants to get rid of his car. We have partnerships with UChicago, UIC and DePaul. Would like to make this connection with Northwestern because I know it can work here.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Sean: For that 18-20 program, is the credit requirement the same?
	•	Charles: You definitely have to pass a credit check since we require credit cards, but not sure if we make different considerations for this group, but don't think so.
	•	Jamie: Any offerings for group offerings for use by multiple people?
	•	Charles: We have something like this, it's pretty unusual- we don't have a history of setting up business accounts, but probably could
	•	David: $8 per hour?
	•	Charles: Yes, and that's all inclusive
	•	Evan: If I run out of gas do I get reimbursed?
	•	Charles: Yes, need to bring back car with at least a quarter tank, have system to track it
	•	Carly: I used ZipCar in LA, do you anticipate prices going down to match LA's prices?
	•	Charles: Hard comparison between two different markets, but registration/membership fees are very much reduced for students.
	•	Carly: Do you see prices going down over time in Evanston?
	•	Charles: Hard to say, we need to modify our fleet and prices depending on area, can't really say how we'll make changes
	•	Ani: Can you tell us how students can be more involved in this discussion?
	•	Charles: Yeah, been in talks with administrators, construction is difficult point to discuss. The timeline for starting potential discussions is slated for April 2014 currently, would appreciate your support for finding alternatives that could get these cars in Evanston sooner.
IV. General Order: Election Commission Presentation
V. General Order: Code Review (Summary of Changes)
VI. New Business: SL1213-28: Budget Timeline Reform
	•	Brad: Currently, the code says the government shall submit the budget in winter quarter and Senate approves it. The reason that the budget selection has been pushed back for the past few years, is that the current deadline is arbitrary, has no impact during spring quarter. New administration has no say in budget currently. Codifying who sits on the committee that determines the budget. Gives input from all parties and is a well rounded group of people composed of both outgoing and incoming positions.  No downside to moving it back since budget doesn't take effect until fall quarter- would need to be approved by the last Senate of spring quarter, giving Senate more time to approve the budget.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Paul: I'm in favor of all this, but if we are breaking the rules now, why was this legislation not proposed a few weeks ago
	•	Brad: Me and Victor take the blame, misunderstood that it didn't have to be determined by the end of spring quarter
	•	Tori: If the incoming and outgoing administration don't agree, what will you do? How will you make sure the budget remains realistic.
	•	Brad: It's a vote- no position can push through an agenda without concurrence.
	•	Abby: This would all take place post-elections, would this include the current speaker?
	•	Brad: Would be the incoming speaker- didn't want even number of people.
	•	Mark: Motion to make this old business
	•	Mark: Seems like a majority of the objections are related to contingent aspects of it. Looking past the fact that Brad and Victor were overwhelmed, this is a good piece of legislation. We should pass this now, before Spring Break and should not continue to violate our own rules. We can flesh out the code-related issues when it's new business.
	•	Sarah (con): My thoughts on this is that it's a pretty big thing to change. We've only had a few hours to consider it and it only has one sponsor, it's too important to have considered for just a couple hours
	•	Alexander (pro): Was hesitant as well, but the way we do things now is bad, it's better to change
	•	Paul (pro): This is a mostly internal change, we always need to get constituent opinions, but I doubt our constituents will have much relevant input, and this is something we need to get done..
	•	Katie (pro): It's problematic that it's being proposed now, nothing to be gained by pushing it off further. Most people are supportive of this legislation, we should get this done
	•	Abby: Biggest objective was working with the new and old board but sounds like it'll work. Will just be changing things for the future anyway.
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is now old business.
 
	•	[Later]
 
	•	Brad: Sincerely apologize for missing the deadline, want to consider bill on individual merits,
	•	Victor: saw difficulties in planning Deering Days.
	•	Abby: Motion to amend that if one of the ad hoc committee members
	•	David: Amendment to
	•	Usually someone on executive board who's sat through multiple tenures, good for people who've seen multiple administrations.
	•	Doesn't make sense, understand reasoning, but someone's who's served as . Mandating that's it's the senior most member of executive board doesn't make sense
	•	Have to disagree, viewing the roles on the executive board narrow mindedly. Whole point is that as a representative of the executive board, speaks to cohesion generally, but rather viewed much more continuously.
	•	David (pro): Often use seniority in our decision making protocols, just not used on executive level too often
	•	Paul: not analogous, on the executive board, what the tech chair does is significantly different from what you do.
	•	Ian: PQ on Abby's amendment
	•	Passed. Amendment is implemented into the bill.
	•	Motion to previous question on the bill
	•	Passed. Legislation is approved.
VII. New Business: SR1213-14: Remembering Professor H. Paul Friesema
	•	Mark: This is a pretty straightforward piece of legislation, was instrumental to founding Northwestern's environmental program, responsible for donating thousands of physical Environmental Impact Statements, owned many books on Native American Policy and Culture that were donated to Smithsonian. Was great teacher that loved talking to students. The fact that he worked up to his death and that he continued to lecture through his 70s is amazing. He is an exemplary human being, had a passion for service and human rights. It's our responsibility to honor his life.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian H: About the last line, regulating that March 8th is day in his honor
	•	Mark: Hope that ASG adopts this every year going forward, and encourages the administration to do so as well.
	•	Serene: What ideas do you have for recognizing him on this day?
	•	Mark: Student groups involved with the environment would be hold events anyway and we should raise those events to increased relevance
	•	David: Two questions- Paul isn't first professor to pass away this year, procedure for honoring professors who pass away? Also, would you consider changing the date to his birthday
	•	Mark: Made more sense to us to do the death day, but open to changing this. There's no precedent of this that I know of, this will hopefully start a trend of remembrance and honor for other great individuals
	•	April: What contact have you had with NAISA?
	•	Mark: Emailed to Heather, haven't received response, but imagine they'd be supportive.
	•	Paul: Motion to make this old business.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Legislation is now old business.
	•	Ian H: Motion to amend to reflect that this day should be recognized annually and that the day honors his birthday (2/20/13)
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Amendments are now included in the bill.
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Legislation is approved.
VIII. Old Business: SL1213-27: LENDing a Hand
	•	Brandon: We will have an authorship speech from Ani.
	•	Ani: Good evening, I am the director of outreach for LEND (affiliated with the Farley Center). Our legislation requests 3,000 dollars for an ASG-named lending program for Evanston individuals and businesses without traditional avenues to funding. We empower these individuals and businesses with micro-loans. We establish connections with these entrepreneurs. We have account managers who visit with our clients on a monthly basis. We show that we are NU students who are reaching out and caring about the Evanston community. To review, this is not the first time LEND has come to ASG -- we came in March 2010, and ASG is considered a seed investor in LEND ($1,500). At that time, LEND did not have history and statistics to present -- just support from community members. We are coming back now with a much more successful program, a solid track record. We have contributed to 6 businesses, and have also helped over 25 other businesses through our business development services.
	•	Brandon: Questions?
	•	Brandon: Pro/Con?
	•	Alex: Con speech. This is almost half of the project pool. The project pool is supposed to be money from students, for students. I think it's great to reach out to the community, but I think this is the wrong source of that money right now.
	•	Ani: Pro speech. To address some concerns -- why now? Why ASG? LEND is facing unprecedented demand ($19,000 in request). We are cold-calling, reaching out to banks, we are trying very hard to meet this demand. The purpose here is to show that LEND is a strong organization, has support from the city of Evanston. When we talk with business owners and tell them that we're from Northwestern University and that we're here to help, it's about perception-changing. We are coming to ask for the establishment of a microloan program bearing ASG's name.
	•	Abby: Motion to amend to $1,500.
	•	Mark: Objection.
	•	Abby: I think this is a great idea, but $3,000 is a very significant portion of the project pool. I would love to at least match what we gave last time.
	•	Mark: Objection rescinded.
	•	Chris: Motion to amend amendment to have ASG match $2,000 if they can get $2,000 from another funding source so that LEND will have $4,000.
	•	Abby: Objection.
	•	Brandon: We are moving to debate on the amendment to the amendment.
	•	Brad: The project pool is about $4,900.
	•	Abby: Con speech. I am okay with $2,000, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with making them match that. I am fine with making the amount $2,000.
	•	Chris: I rescind the amendment and would like to amend to just $2,000 (without matching).
	•	Brandon: moving to a vote.
	•	Vote -- passed. Amended to $2,000.
	•	Brandon: moving to a vote on Abby's amendment.
	•	Vote -- passed. Amended to $2,000.
	•	Mark: Motion to amend. I think at the end of the 18-month period, the funds should be returned to the project pool and reconsidered for re-allocation.
	•	Brandon: Moving to debate on this amendment.
	•	Alex: This is getting too crazy. We're all going in different directions. The idea of this bill is to give a certain amount of money to LEND. At the end of the day, the fundamental question is whether or not this is the right source for this funding.
	•	Sarah: Question -- is it possible that at that point, LEND would not have the money to return if loans were out at that time?
	•	Ani: We keep a loan reserve on hand. We don't generally accept give-back programs because at that time, we might be faced with requests and be unable to give out loans at critical moments for Evanston businesses. We often have quick turnaround times for loans. We would also like to keep expanding.
	•	Sarah: Can LEND guarantee that the money could be returned?
	•	Ani: It's possible that it would be a problem -- we immediately turn around funds once they get repaid.
	•	Brandon: Pro speech on Mark's amendment?
	•	Paul: LEND gets money from other sources. I'm uncomfortable that we might be setting a precedent for LEND to be a line item out of ASG's budget. I don't like the idea of consistently giving away money from our project pool.
	•	Mark: I would like to clarify -- it would be a check-in point for Senate. The money could be returned or could remain in the pool. I want to build transparency between ASG and LEND. In the spirit of microfinance, I think we need to have an ability to reclaim our funds or let them remain in LEND's pool.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question.
	•	Alex: Objection.
	•	Ian: Rescind.
	•	Brandon: Con speech?
	•	Alex: I do not think that this idea is in line with the original purpose or intent of this legislation. This makes it too complicated. I think this should be an up-or-down vote on allocating the money. I don't know if LEND has the structure in place for this to be feasible.
	•	Ani: We would be open to extending to 24 months. We are run by donations. It is in the legislation that LEND would come back with regular updates. From a logistical standpoint, this could be very problematic for us.
	•	Brandon: Pro speech?
	•	Mark: Motion to amend to 12 months (down from 18 months).
	•	Seconded.
	•	Ani: 18 months is how long the maturation process is for a loan. We do not give out 12-month loans. Loans are paid back over the course of 18 months.
	•	Neel: Who would be responsible for the check-in?
	•	Alex: Motion to amend to 19 months.
	•	Seconded.
	•	Brandon: moving to a vote.
	•	Mark: Division.
	•	Vote -- passed. Reporting date on the amendment is now 19 months.
	•	Brandon: moving to a vote.
	•	Vote -- passed.
	•	Brandon: we are back to Mark's amendment on re-consideration of the funds after 19 months.
	•	LEND: Con speech. This is a risk because those funds could be allocated to a client at that time. We do not want a loan from ASG.
	•	Mark: I'm concerned about why your reserve capital is not adequate to ensure the possible return of $2,000.
	•	LEND: That money is for default on loans.
	•	Mark: But you're framing this in terms of it hurting someone in Evanston, which isn't the case.
	•	LEND: If we returned the $2,000, we would only have $3,000 in reserve.
	•	Mark: Pro speech. We need to have oversight on this money. I think if we have the ability to see the success play out, then this could be a worthwhile use of our money.
	•	Brad: Question -- if it was a $2,000 loan or $0, which would you prefer?
	•	Guarav: We do not want a loan. To speak to the point of oversight, we have a Board of Directors. We have a faculty advisor, a number of small business owners on the board. The chairman of the board owns a private equity fund in Evanston. So there is a ton of oversight.
	•	Siddiq: Is LEND an ASG-recognized organization?
	•	Ani: No.
	•	Mark: Exact wording of the amendment: After a period of 19 months, LEND will return to Senate with updates on their loan progress, and Senate will have the opportunity to continue the program or to request that funding be returned.
	•	Alex: Con speech. We have heard from LEND, and they do not want a loan. I think this is a bad idea overall.
	•	Dana: Con speech. I think the spirit of the legislation is to create a lending program, and this amendment is not in line with the spirit of the bill. I think it will detract from the good of the original legislation.
	•	Alex L: Question. Do you think it would be very difficult to do this in the 19-month timeframe?
	•	Guarav: Absolutely. This could leave LEND or the client hanging.
	•	Brandon: We are in line for a vote on Mark's amendment.
	•	Vote -- amendment fails.
	•	Brandon: We are back to the original legislation.
	•	Siddiq: Motion to amend. We need a stipulation that LEND has some quarterly on-campus programming.
	•	Brandon: We are in line for a con speech on the amendment.
	•	Alex: Con speech. This is getting too complicated.
	•	Abby: Con speech. LEND has a small overhead and would not have the funds for programming.
	•	Mark: Con speech. This would re-frame the entire context of the bill.
	•	Ani: We would love to bring back what we're doing to the student body at large. It's just difficult to do that because we're not ASG-recognized. We have had programming in the past that has been successful (co-spon with NCDC). We would be happy to have programming and to do it in conjunction with ASG.
	•	Guarav: Our average loan size is close to $3,000. Having events would cut into that funding. Something to consider.
	•	Alex: Question. Is there anything to be gained from putting this in the bill?
	•	Ani: We are planning to do this anyway. We try to keep publicity costs low. Putting this in the bill creates a different expectation.
	•	Brandon: We are in line to continue debating the amendment.
	•	Siddiq: Rescind amendment.
	•	Brandon: We are back to the original legislation.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question.
	•	Mark: Objection.
	•	Ian: Rescind.
	•	Brandon: We are in line for a pro speech on the entire bill.
	•	Abby: Pro speech. I recognize that this is a lot of money, but building stronger relations with Evanston is a good idea. We do not have to follow SAFC guidelines.
	•	Chris: Pro speech. Some people think this will not benefit students. The CR committee puts on events and programs that benefit students regardless of whether or not they are getting something tangible from them. For example, we are putting on a candidate forum. This is a long-term benefit to NU students. Improving relations with Evanston is very important.
	•	Mark: Con speech. I think this is a very irresponsible use of the SAF. I think LEND will find funding from other sources and will continue to do great work. This organization is not ASG-recognized, is rather young, and is asking for more money than most B-status organizations. I think there are others who will be willing to allocate money to this fund.
	•	Paul: Con speech. If we just spent time talking about making this relevant to students (through on-campus student programming), I do not think this is relevant to undergrads at NU.
	•	Tori: I think this sets a precedent that ASG donates to organizations. Where will we draw the line with donating to charitable organizations? We don't make donations.
	•	Neel: To give a non-ASG-recognized organization $2,000 is out of line.
	•	Ani: Pro speech. We understand that the SAF is a precious resource. The Senate recently created a Community Engagement Grant that benefited a few small groups of students that used that money in Evanston. NU is not an island. The SAF should not be treated as "play money" for students. We as students need to do something to build credibility with the Evanston community. That way, when we ask them for allowances, they are a bit more amenable to that, and they understand that students realize that they have a civic duty. ASG does make donations. Other groups like Mayfest have gotten "donations" from the project pool before. We are looking to build the credibility of the student body as a group of students that understand that they are not living in a bubble. We want to help entrepreneurs take their business to the next level. We work directly on the behalf of students to improve the reputation of NU and its students.
	•	Paul: Con speech. If LEND does not get this money, they will not just disappear.
	•	Siddiq: Con speech. LEND does great things, but why limit LEND's work to just its members? It would have a great impact on campus if LEND shared its information and experience with the NU community.
	•	Alex: Point of information -- could LEND ask for this money again in the spring?
	•	Ani: We are at liberty to come back to the project pool, but we are at an unprecedented demand right now.
	•	MCSA Senator: Other groups provide great opportunities for all students, but LEND does not. It is a select group of students handling community relations.
	•	Brandon: We are in line for a vote on the legislation.
	•	Brad: Division.
	•	Vote: 12-12-4 -- the legislation fails.
	•	Ani: Reconsider by secret ballot?
	•	Mark: Objection.
	•	Brandon: This is not debatable. We will move to a vote on whether to reconsider. This needs a majority.
	•	Brad: Division.
	•	Brandon: The motion to reconsider fails.
IX. Good of the Order & Announcements
	•	Northwestern drag show
	•	Alpha phi food philanthropy benefits Greek Build
	•	Alex: Evanston first ward candidate forum, will be moderating
	•	Victor: Happy St. Paddy's day on Saturday

Senate Adjourned


ASG Senate Minutes
04-03-13

I. Executive Board Reports
	•	Victor: Student Affairs have asked me to create a list of student achievements, will be compiling that within the next few weeks- let me know if you have input. I talked to the person in charge of the speaker selection process for graduation- Morty controls it, but looking to get more student input into the process
	•	Brad: 10K is ending later this week, look out for more news on that.
	•	Alex: Confirmed Haley Hinkle- now have a new shuttle stop! Definitely read my exec board report and let me know if you want to work in any specific areas.
	•	Neil: Added questions to CTECs regarding learning outcomes, want to create culture shift in teaching about learning outcomes. Read my exec board report.
	•	Siddiq: Finished guideline review.
	•	Neel: Released apps for SGC- we have some Senator spots, it's the best committee, so consider running.
	•	David: Cab Corner- thanks to those who used it, we got 200 students to use it and hope to increase that number. The company has other insights and data that will help going into the future. BookSwap- please post your books if you haven't already, please use it! Please help with PR and tabling
	•	Sarah: Will there ever be books listed on the website that aren't there for current classes?
	•	Ethan: HEY EVERYBODY! We have old textbooks from every quarter this year in our database- you can search by class or by the title of the book- we indicate by each book whether it's required or just recommended. One feature we'll be introducing is expiring posts so that students who have graduated have their book listings removed. Check it out!
	•	Brad: Update on community relations- the alderman elections are on April 9th, early voting is open right now, so you can go to city hall now through Saturday to vote. If you are a resident of the first ward, please vote! ASG is non-partisan, however, as residents of Evanston you are all welcome to tell your friends who to vote for.
	•	Carly: If you are interested in being a mentor for a new Senator, let me know. We also have some openings on the operations committee, so let me know if you're interested. New Senators, please stand up and introduce yourselves! We'll also be enforcing the PR requirement more heavily.
	•	Karley: Hi, I'm representing FMO.
	•	Adam: Hi, I'm Adam and I'll be serving as the new Senator representing College Democrats and Political Union.
	•	Annas: I'm serving as the interim Science Senator, representing SPS, UCC, and BSA
	•	Andrew: I'm Andrew and I'm serving as the new College Republicans Senator.
	•	Olu: I'm Olu and I'll be representing ASA.
	•	Mark: Talked with the head of sustainability at Microsoft, will be communicating with her about making larger institutions more sustainable. Wrapped up the CFL and showerhead campaign. Norris is having their first sustainability meeting with me on Friday. NU SOS will be happening on Friday, it's free, all day Friday. The theme is economy and the environment.
	•	Ani: Will detail the election process, but we have several speakers before that point, the first being Todd Adams, the new Dean of Students!
II. Special Order: Todd Adams, Dean of Students
	•	Todd: [Introductory Speech]
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian: Upper level administrators like to have meetings and summits involving students- in most of these meetings it seems like I'm more of a problem to be rectified, rather than a student voice. How will you be more welcoming to student concerns?
	•	Todd: There are a couple of ways- I sit on a couple of groups on upper administrations, one of them is more student affairs oriented that has administration like Burgie and PTI- I'm also a part of the undergraduate council which incorporates many of the deans in Northwestern's schools. My predecessor may not have been invited to these meetings, and I'm glad that I'll be working in this capacity. I want to also establish a student advisory group that reviews policies and procedures and gives more student input.
	•	Alexander: What are the biggest things that you can take from Duke to bring here?
	•	Todd: There are a number of initiatives including a campus inclusion committee- things related to the Northwestern experience and how you guys interact with each other. Also, case management- we have 300 students we're working with already, so there's certainly a need. We need to develop a care network across the institution that's not in place right now.
	•	Mark: Is your jurisdiction just undergraduates or Evanston campus, or both?
	•	Todd: All students- it's a different dynamic though since the graduate schools are even more decentralized than Evanston's campus. I've begun to spend more time down on the Chicago campus and working with faculty there. I've been to a number of places, and it's very decentralized here.
	•	Katie: Preferred method of communication?
	•	Todd: You can email me, call me, I'm pretty quick on email though. I work a lot of hours and am at a lot of things, but I like that, so definitely invite me to things. I'm not hard to find and am usually in Scott Hall.
	•	Mark: What can we do as student government representatives to assist your position?
	•	Todd: I'm working with ASG a lot now, but as I said, invite me to things! I haven't talked to a lot of students yet and would love to spend some time with all of you all. Also, let me know and remember that I'm an outlet for student concerns.
	•	David: Final thoughts on Chris Collins?
	•	Todd: think he's a great recruiter- hope to bring him to other opportunities like this and a bunch of other places over the next few months.
III. Special Order: Student Groups Subcommittee Chairs Confirmation
	•	Neel: Recently founded some subcommittees on SGC- I appointed some chairs. The SGC is in charge of all B and T status group on campus. Each group executive is responsible for around 8 groups on campus and is responsible for helping them with funding. They also help with event planning for things like Spring Leadership Training and the Activities Fairs. We also work with training new members and ensuring they attend groups that are funded through the SAF like the SAFC. For the funding subcommittee, I appointed Steph Wang, for events planning I appointed Danielle, and I put Elena in charge of training new GEs.
	•	Ani: Please introduce yourselves.
	•	Elena: I'm a junior and have been on the SGC since fall quarter of freshman year. I like training in new members and have an eye for detail.
	•	Danielle: I've also been on the committee since fall quarter of my freshman year, though not as long as Elena.
	•	Steph: I've had a lot of experience with funding and have been a Senator for a year, served on SAFC and SGC, served as a group's treasurer, had experience from every perspective.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Mike: So, for the queen of funding, when it comes to funding clubs, are you just preparing funding to give to these organizations, or also planning to emphasize fundraising and resources for new and emerging groups?
	•	Steph: Definitely, we've been putting an emphasis on this, specifically on t-status grants and looking to different departments for funding.
	•	Danielle: To add onto that, Jesse and Angela are a part of another subcommittee that manages new groups, and a lot of the time they work with groups to focus o this as well.
	•	Ani: Moving into an endorsement/question/debate period
	•	X: Why do you trust a freshman for event planning?
	•	Neel: Traditionally, Lauren took up 100% of the responsibility for planning events, so no one currently has any more experience with event planning. Danielle has been very efficient with her work and figured she'd be a good fit for the position. She has an analytical mind for the position
	•	X: Can you elaborate on how these positions would interact with exec and senate?
	•	Neel: Anything that deals with funding, the funding subcommittee will have their name on it. I will still be working with it, but they will deal with everything funding
	•	X: The confirmation is necessary because of something in the SGC code?
	•	Neel: Yeah, and I just wanted to have Senate's input on this.
	•	Alexander: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. All three members are approved.
IV. General Order: Firearm Regulation Committee Letters Presentation
	•	Alexander: Today was the last day the firearm committee was functioning- we got five schools supporting our letter. We feel that the resolution broadly represents students-  we'll be mailing out several letters to the Senate and the House.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	David: Are all the schools signing onto this in Illinois?
	•	Alexander: Yep.
	•	Alex: Have you heard back from any of these representatives?
	•	Alexander: One of the assistants in Jan Sckaowsky's office said that she'll let us know soon, haven't heard anything else besides that.
V. General Order: Election Guideline Review
	•	Abby: The election commission decided to make two minor changes- we changed that, rather than ASG providing a template, we changed the guidelines so that candidates make their own templates. We also changed a rule regarding the recording of debates.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Sarah: Regarding the website template- we did this in the past so that we could suspend a candidate's website, will changing this take away that ability?
	•	Ani: The website will be routed through the ASG server still, so that will still be possible.
	•	Motoki: I know you guys don't know how many people will run, but have you found pricing for resources for those running?
	•	Abby: Looked into this- bought some materials, will know earlier in the future because people will be declaring much earlier.
	•	Ethan: This has probably already been discussed, but has approval voting been discussed?
	•	Abby: Hasn't been brought to my attention
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- passed. Election guidelines are amended.
VI. New Business: SR1213-14: Crosswalk Construction
	•	Alex: There is a dangerous curve between dorms like 1835, Jones & interfaith where many students have to jaywalk. Want to propose the construction of a crosswalk to make this area safer for students.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Olu: How much time does it take to walk to existing crosswalk?
	•	Alex: It's enough to be annoying.
	•	Dana: How much do you really anticipate this changing anything? If cars are already stopping at the existing crosswalk, what will this change?
	•	Alex: Would make it easier for students and tour groups to cross, but would also draw more attention to the problem and hopefully force bigger solutions in the future.
	•	Mike: Have you considered adding a stop sign?
	•	Alex: Facilities said this wouldn't be feasible because of the speed most cars are coming around the bend.
	•	Ian H: Are you aware they took that crosswalk out 2 years ago?
	•	Alex: I didn't know one was here and removed- he didn't bring that up.
	•	Tori: Do you think that people in Jones will use this?
	•	Alex: Don't think so- wanted a more extreme solution, but decided that wouldn't be feasible and that this would be a good first step.
	•	Petros: Do you think that having this sign installed only to be removed later is productive?
	•	Alex: I want to support this because I don't think Evanston could oppose this.
	•	Hannah: Do you know why they removed the original crosswalk
	•	Ian H: They were redoing the asphalt and never replaced the crosswalk and removed the signs.
	•	Jesse: Would it be possible to put a stop sign or a slow down sign in the middle of the road? I wouldn't use the crosswalk, but that intersection has been the most harmful thing to my health at Northwestern.
	•	Alex: He told me a lot of things that are required for a crosswalk.
	•	Angela: I don't understand why the tone of the discussion you had with this administrator was such that you feel you need to make a point, rather than making more direct solutions?
	•	Alex: It's not direct for a reason, these conversations happened by phone- this idea was the one that he found least objection to.
VII. Emergency Legislation: SL1213-29: Get Out The Vote, Northwestern!
	•	Chris: Didn't have a chance to get this approved earlier, hence why it's up as emergency now.
	•	Chris: The bill that you're looking at is very general- I'm coming to ask you from $105 from the Senate project pool- we've been sitting outside dorms and dining halls and held multiple candidate forums where food was served. The food helped to attract students- on April 9th, we'd also like to have pizza down by the arch, we just want to give people an opportunity to check out the elections
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Katie: This isn't incentivizing voting, right?
	•	Chris: While there is a legal precedent, this is in no way an incentive.
	•	Andrew: How many people do you think are registered that won't be voting
	•	Chris: Rough estimates indicate that around 800 students are registered in the 1st ward, want to make sure they know when the election is.
	•	Motoki: In previous years, when handing out food they used free bagels, why did you decide to use pizza instead of that?
	•	Chris: We reached out to Andy's to see if they'd provide free custard or coupons, they didn't. We could go with Project Cookie again, but wanted something different.
	•	Brad: Can you clarify details about the previous lawsuit?
	•	Chris: Brought up by Ald. Judy Fiske, regarding food given to students and she accused the school of incentivizing students to vote against her… not quite sure of other details.
	•	Mike: Can you clarify what food was provided with the previous lawsuit.
	•	Brad: It was pizza.
	•	Ian: Motion to move this old business.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Legislation is now old business.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian: Do you see $105 as a good estimate of how much pizza you'll actually need?
	•	Chris: figured it out to six pizzas, figured it'd be enough
	•	Brad: Motion to amend to change amount allocated to $500.
	•	Senators: Multiple objections
	•	Brad: $105 will not be enough, people won't even stop to talk, will just be grabbing pizza
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con.
	•	Olu (con): It's too much, need to moderate the amount to around $300.
	•	Motoki (pro): The higher the better- whatever's not used will come back. Pretty sure Chris isn't stupid.
	•	Ian (pro): This is very wisely spent since it's in the heart of the 1st ward. $500 of pizza could buy a lot of outreach
	•	Petros (con): I approve of pizza and using it to get people to vote, but don't feel comfortable if we don't know the exact amount in the pool
	•	Alex (con): Against using the project pool for food.
	•	Alexander: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- division.
	•	Ay- 25
	•	Nay- 9
	•	Abstentions- 2
	•	Vote- passes. Amendment is included in the bill.
	•	Ani: In line for a con speech on the bill itself
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- passed. Legislation is approved.
VIII. Special Order: Parliamentary Body Elections
	•	Ani: Two positions up right now, my position and the position of Parliamentarian.
	•	Ani: Opening the floor for nominations for Speaker of the Senate.
	•	Ian: I nominate Katie.
	•	Katie: I accept.
	•	Senator: I nominate Abby.
	•	Abby: I respectfully decline.
	•	David: I nominate Jesse.
	•	Jesse: I accept- no, just kidding you can take me off.
	•	Ani: Introduce yourself
	•	Katie: I have speech and I'm gonna read it cause I wrote it. [Great Speech]
	•	Ani: Questions for Katie?
	•	Motoki: Will you bring back paper agendas and what is the ideal setup of the Senate room?
	•	Katie: Tough problem, but looking for solutions- think that what we've been moving toward has been a move in the right direction. I think tables are important, but open to suggestions.
	•	Ian: How do you feel about a dress code for Senate?
	•	Katie: I think it's good to keep things moderately professional.
	•	David: Role you hope to play in recruitment and strategies toward high retention?
	•	Katie: Responsibilities toward recruitment are moving toward the Chief of Staff, but would want to be at the forefront of recruitment efforts.
	•	Mike: Mentioned that you want to make sure Senators remain focused, how do you plan to ensure that they do?
	•	Katie: I think it's important to call each other out when we're being disruptive.
	•	Abby: Treasurer has been dissolved- how will you be able to make sure that communication with the EVP is adequate?
	•	Katie: Should be better in the future with a new EVP and will ensure that the project pool number is always available.
	•	Petros: I know it's a frequent occurrence in long Senates that people tend to filter out- how to mitigate that and hold Senators accountable?
	•	Katie: Would work through caucus and working with Senators individually to ensure they remain engaged throughout the entire session.
	•	Dana: Are you planning to implement any changes in Senate procedure?
	•	Katie: I think that things are working well with the model we have now, wouldn't make any major changes.
	•	Jane: You mentioned about respecting the time of Senators- how do you plan to manage this?
	•	Katie: I think it's best to use the time that we have efficiently by being efficient with the motions we make and respecting each other's time.
	•	Alex: Criteria for determining which administrators can come and talk to us?
	•	Katie: Administrators are a good thing, would welcome most administration that have an interest in addressing Senate and filter vendors before allowing them to come.
	•	Tori: Policy on bringing in speakers during busy weeks?
	•	Katie: I know some administrator's schedules are rigid and it's difficult to know how long an agenda will take in advance, but would avoid bringing them in during high traffic times.
	•	Ian: Role of ASG exec during senate?
	•	Katie: I think it's important that exec members are in Senate and that they understand that we're all stakeholders in this organization's decisions.
	•	Motoki: Speaker is generally a competitive spot but you're running unopposed- how will you make sure Senators remain engaged in other leadership opportunities?
	•	Katie: There have been more opportunities for Senators to seek positions for leadership than ever before- it's important to talk about recruitment early.
	•	Carly: What do you see as Senate's biggest flaw and how to best address it?
	•	Katie: Hard to keep Senators focused- need to make sure that Senators get familiar with Senate quickly and don't spend half the quarter confused about what we're doing.
	•	David: Motion to white ballot.
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Katie Funderberg is confirmed as the 2013-2014 ASG Speaker of the Senate.
	•	Ani: Now opening nominations for Parliamentarian.
	•	Senator: I nominate Abby.
	•	Abby: I accept.
	•	Ani: Introduce yourself.
	•	Abby: I don't have a speech prepared like Katie, but I've served on Rules previously under Brandon and having a chance to work with him while serving as Election Commissioner has shown me a lot more about the position's responsibilities and role.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Dana: Working relationship with Katie?
	•	Abby: We've met before and served together as PHA Senators- we'll get along.
	•	Ian: Do you understand preferential voting?
	•	Abby: Yes!
	•	Victor: Balancing objectivity as election commissioner with being able to select who you'll be working with.
	•	Abby: It'll be tough, but the Parliamentarian must work in a position of objectivity throughout the term, so I'm confident I can balance the responsibility.
	•	Jesse: Support the ability to eject Senators?
	•	Abby: I'd have to talk with Katie, but if they're being really disruptive then yes.
	•	Ian: How will you ensure parliamentary procedure will be maintained and that the speaker isn't taking too many liberties with granting motions.
	•	Abby: I'll do my best to work with Katie to ensure that things don't get out of hand.
	•	Alex: Sometimes the Speaker has to step down, do you feel like you could assume the role of Speaker?
	•	Abby: I'm sure that through serving in the position, I'll become more comfortable with assuming this role.
	•	Mark: Motion to white ballot
	•	Vote- passed unanimously. Abby Klearman is confirmed as the 2013-2014 ASG Parliamentarian.
IX. Good of the Order & Announcements

Senate Adjourned



Northwestern University
Associated Student Government
Meeting of the Senate
January, 21, 2014
 
	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	General Order: Dining Master Plan Focus Group
	•	Rob: Thanks for giving us the time, we scheduled around you guys, because we don’t often get the chance to come before Student Senate. We are looking at big picture things and in order to do that, we need to understand what we’re doing now. We look at a lot of programs, but we’re really trying to figure out what to do at Northwestern. I heard a bit about sustainability, locations, meal plans, etc. What we’re looking for is what the current issues are that we can delve into over the next 6 months. 
	•	Sojo: What are the key issues you’ve noticed?
	•	Isaac: As a member of the greek community who lives in a residential hall, we have to buy meal plans even though some greek houses require you to have meal plans as well. I essentially throw away money, because I never use those meals. 
	•	Lauren: I think the costs are just ridiculous. On the block plan, each of my meals is $16.50. A lot of other schools use points instead of meals and I think that would be a lot better of a system. 
	•	Sojo: Why would people not have meal plans? 
	•	Off-campus, don’t eat at dining halls and not often at Norris. 
	•	Noah: I’d like to see a meal plan just for Norris. 
	•	Chris: Rob and Sojo aren’t with Sodexo, they are hired as separate consultants. So be brutal, but not brutal at them. 
	•	Kevin: I’d like to see a way to use points in Evanston businesses. 
	•	Daniel: There seems to be discrepancy in the quality of fresh produce between the different dining halls. Hinman kills it and Elder is not so good. 
	•	Bella: That reminded me that I’ve never seen an avocado in the dining hall. Maybe in Alison once a week there is a fresh fruit salad, but that’s a once a week thing. 
	•	Korri: I would love to see some sort of interaction with student groups that concerns food, like Spoon. 
	•	Isaac: Dining can help solidify the perceived divide between North and South campus. There is only one that’s in the middle and it isn’t even really in the middle. People eat on their side of campus and separate communities develop. 
	•	Matt: We’ve touched on the quality of dining halls and fruit availability, I’ve eaten a lot in Alison or Plex and been to the others. Generally, there aren’t many people taking the apples, bananas, etc. Sometimes they have melon, but it’s not the quality you would want. There’s a difference between having fruit available and having fruit people would want. People also want more of a selection. 
	•	Christina: Some have great vegetarian/vegan and some do not, so I’d like that to be consistent. I think people would like to buy ingredients at C-stores. I think people would like to see where things come from and also where they come from. There is often a discrepancy between the label and what the food actually is. 
	•	Noah: I think having more local and more sustainable sourcing would be great. 
	•	-: There are more than one faRm to table restaurants in Evanston and I think there are ways to get those restaurants in the guest appearances in the dining halls. Let’s change up the pace!
	•	Parag: There needs to be consolidation of the dining halls or destination dining, where there are different kinds of foods at different places. 
	•	Daniel: In terms of the people who work there, most have been there forever and are great, but some I always get undercooked chicken, etc. The labels have unrealistic serving options. 
	•	Lauren: Willard specifically is really hit or miss, because it’s not very good for options, since it’s smaller. With the convenience stores, I think we just need healthier options. Also, our hummus, peanut butter and butter all taste kind of weird. 
	•	Christina: I also don’t know what four ounces is if they say that on the label. There should be some form of reference. 
	•	Nehaarika: I think that the dining hall hours are so inconvenient with our class schedules. Also I’ve seen the people make pasta with meat and then use the same utensils to serve vegetarian food. 
	•	Kevin: I think Parag’s comment on dining destination is really interesting. I mainly eat lunch in Norris on my very small meal plan, but I think restaurant/full meal places would be great farther North on campus. It’d be nice to have something like Frontera up North. 
	•	Joshua: It’d be nice to have a late night option on North Campus. As someone who lives in Elder, it seems like it’s only a half dining hall. It’s kind of like a ghost town. 
	•	Matt: Kind of similar to Kevin, I think it’d be nice to expand the grab and go options on South campus. Something I’d really like to see is in the Student Center, some kind of rotating featured restaurant from Evanston. That would change periodically through the year. One to expose people to Evanston restaurants and increase options. 
	•	Eric: Maybe more on the go meals in dining halls in general. 
	•	Olivia: Currently if you try to take anything out, they don’t like you to.
	•	Austin: I think living wages for our staff is really important as well. There was a campaign my freshman year around that. 
	•	Matt: It’d be great if we could use our equivalencies or points at Kellogg. 
	•	Kevin: In a similar vein, I wish we could use points/meals at the Athletic stadium. 
	•	Bella: Eric was telling me he got food from the Garrett Evangelical Center for $4 and that echoes the disparity between food prices. 
	•	Daniel: Not only are the options for grab and go over priced, but they are also not very healthy. An incentive for off campus plans would be to give them some sort of discount. Even if it’s terrible for you, at least it’s a bit cheaper!
	•	Sojo: Something from the focus group earlier was about community. How is that here? 
	•	Matt: When I was on a meal plan, I felt mainly that the hours made it so you just had to make do. It was hard to find a time where everyone could eat together. 
	•	Aeryn: It was the same way for me and if I wanted to have a nice time to hang out, we’d go to a restaurant in Evanston. 
	•	Wendy: Definitely extended hours, but especially on the weekends. 
	•	Kevin: I would say three quick things. More TVs in the dining halls on sports channels and current events, I think that creates more community. Being able to used dining halls in the evenings would be great, since that’s open space. Also if off campus students could get their groceries from dining halls would be interesting, something like Amazon Fresh. 
	•	Lauren: I live in a res college and we have our own room and always see someone I know, so there is community. 
	•	Bella: If the goal is to increase community, then I think you have to consider having a dining hall in every dorm. 
	•	Joshua: In Elder, basically everyone who lives in Elder lives in Elder and that’s pretty nice. 
	•	Liz: Frans is a really good model for late night and for community. People go down there to do homework between 8 and 2 and was super helpful when I lived there. Open during homework hours could promote community. 
	•	Kenny: I think the North-South divide, I definitely feel it. Willard and Alison have really strong communities, and Sargent is the main hub for North Campus with the athletes. With the new Norris, there definitely needs to be better options. With a better student union, we could refocus and have a cohesive community. 
	•	Sojo: Catering. Do you guys order food? What have your experiences been? 
	•	Daniel: I think there shold be options for ordering less food, because we always have too much. 
	•	Isaac: ASG hosted a conference and we ordered from Sodexo, because we had to, since we were hosting in Norris. It was more expensive and less food than the previous day when we didn’t have to - and lower quality. 
	•	Kaley: Sodexo is just ridiculously expensive and normally not good. It makes a lot sense to get it at somewhere like potbelly. 
	•	Daniel: We have a big event in Alianza with a lot of food, but it seems like the food is just there and nobody is there to refill it or reheat, etc. 
	•	-: We’re doing an event for my theatre board and it’s Jewish, so there need to be Kosher options. With our history with Sodexo, we can’t trust that something will be vegetarian or kosher. 
	•	Christina: For sustainability, some of the norms are decidedly unsustainable if you don’t ask to change it. Also take out options!
	•	Wendy: The people that work at the stations is part of the community, if they are happy people, that makes me happy. 
	•	Bella: One thing Sodexo has started to do is fun themed events or pop up dining, which I think it really cool. Last year in Sargent there was a Luau thing. They also do competitions between the dining halls, which I think are fun. It obviously costs more than the normal day to day, but I think it’s valuable. 
	•	Kaley: It kind of sucks to not be able to do the Block plan as a Freshman. 
	•	Daniel: The all you can eat mode of the dining hall is very useful to me. 
	•	Liz: I don’t eat the same as a 20 year old boy and I don’t like have to pay the same amount for so much less. 
	•	Serene: I live off campus and late at night it would be nice to have places to go. What if the university could make a deal with a cafe to stay open later. Or have Northwestern nights at places. 
	•	Isaac: In the 80s there used to be a bar in Norris. Bring back the Norris bar. 
	•	General Order: Student Groups Vice President Confirmation: Kenny Mok
	•	Noah: We selected Kenny because he is immensely qualified. We liked his experience in ASGa and also his outside experience. 
	•	Kenny: I’m running for VP for student groups, because I really care about student groups. I think student group funding is one of the most important parts of ASG. When I first came to Northwestern, I was more than excited to meet people with different interests. That enthusiasm carried over into getting involved in other things, like my Greek chapter and APAC. As Outreach Chair in APAC, I got to understand more about the multicultural community. I’ve also had experience with larger groups and smaller groups like Supplies for Dreams. At the end of last year, I was presented with leadership positions in these groups, but I decided to throw myself farther into ASG. I thought it was the best way for me to contribute. Through my experience as a Group Executive, I was advising mainly theater groups as well as some others. I began to understand more unique group needs and why it was so important. I have so much respect to theater students, especially, because they have so much to go through. There are ways we can make it easier. I’ve been involved inside and outside of the committee in conversations about how to make funding better. It is important to look at how we can support groups equitably, not just focusing on open events. Finally, four main things. I want to redefine what a GE can be, because a huge interaction between ASG and non-ASG is through the SGC. I want to address nontraditional groups and how we can support them, like community service, performance, and publications. I also really want to address over-programming. There are great events, but people are too busy with their own events. I think there should be a comprehensive database of what groups are doing and at what time and then SGC should connect them. The last thing is to advocate for student groups. In the School of Comm, certain groups get access to the cage and similar B-status film groups do not have that access. How can we speak up for them? This is something I could see myself doing for the rest of college and I think I could do well. 
	•	Isaac: In your priorities you talk a lot about things that are either part of SARC or if you implemented them without the FVP would create inconsistencies. Can you speak how you’ll work with those people and also the entire exec board? 
	•	Kenny: I know I just explained a lot of my opinions, but I get that there are a lot of players. I would say I’m there to offer my opinion and speak up for students. In terms of working with other people, I think my past experiences show I can do that. 
	•	Bella: How would you describe your leadership style?
	•	Kenny: I’d say my strongest characteristic is I value the unique capabilities of all my team members. I want to meet with all the people in the team and bring the best out of them. A weakness with that is maybe getting a bit too caught up in that and not focusing on the committee as a whole, but I’m confident I can balance those things. 
	•	He is elected unanimously. 
	•	Sworn in. 
	•	Alex said some words. They were beautiful. 
	•	General Order: Rules Committee Elections
	•	Lauren: I nominate Will Rice. 
	•	Will: I respectfully decline. 
	•	Lauren: I nominate Jake Rothstein. 
	•	Serene: I nominate Melisa. 
	•	Melisa: I respectfully decline 
	•	Nehaarika: I nominate Ross, I respectfully decline. 
	•	Joji: I nominate Faheem. 
	•	Faheem: I respectfully decline. 
	•	Petros: I nominate myself. 
	•	Eric: I nominate Matt. 
	•	Matt: I accept. 
	•	Petros: I withdraw my nomination. 
	•	Jake: Hi, I’m Jake. I’m a freshman senator for District 4. I worked on the Student Engagement Stipend Committee and am currently on the Election Commission. If the Rules Committee does it’s job, it saves a lot of time in Senate. 
	•	Matt: Hi, I’m Matt. I’m a junior and I’m the off campus caucus whip. I am currently transitioning out of the responsibility in my fraternity where I work with our bylaws. I think that experience will help me in this role. 
	•	Johnny: How fast can you type? 
	•	Matt: Pretty fast. 100. 
	•	Jake: Less than that.
	•	Isaac: Motion to white ballot. 
	•	Passed unanimously. 
	•	Isaac: I nominate Kaley. 
	•	Kaley: Tentative yes. 
	•	Joji: I nominate Ariel. 
	•	Ariel: I accept. 
	•	Kaley: I withdraw. 
	•	Ariel: I really like ASG, so why not? 
	•	Motion to white ballot. 
	•	Unanimous. 
	•	General Order: Election Guidelines Review
	•	Dana will now present the revised election guidelines. these will be brought to vote next week.
	•	Dana: All of the major changes are in purple.  the things in blue are important things. the first thing is that we want to extend campaigning from one week to two. last year it was one, and we had a much lower turnout. this may be because of the shorter time period. another change we made was elimnating ground flyering. We increased sidewalk chalk to 100 sticks instead of 50. thats arbitrary. we also lowered the amount of masking tape.  we also changed the physical dates to match up with this year. It used to say that voting booths weren’t allowed at all. All senators and the exec must be present for at least one debate (that’s unchanged). we changed the languaage about the technology VP,  because we don’t have any. We also included a No Confidence option on the ballot. The election will be held on april 15th. All confirmed violations are posted to the ASG website, including the punishment. Last year we didn’t have any. If you have concerns, we’d love to hear them now. We’ve already heard that the 2-week time will conflict with other things.
	•	Julia: my concern with the 2 week campaign is that it is too much. The voter turnout had to do with competition and the timing of the election. Speaking from experience from Ani and Victors campaign, people don’t pay attention to the first period.
	•	Isaac: I also want to adress the length from a different perspective. It’s important from the student body that the only thing they see from us all year is a really heated campaign, which looks bad. Second, we don’t wnt to spend 2 weeks pushing this in everybodys face so that they are sick of ASG adn don’t pay attention to anything else we do. 
	•	JOhnathan: we have to think about the canidates too - two weeks is a long time
	•	Liz: Isaac and jonathan brought up good points. We need to not leave a bad taste in the students mouth. and we have to think of the candidates lives.
	•	Dana: so i hear a lot about shortening the campaign, but i am hesitent to shorten it to just one week. the voter turnout dropped off 50%. a lot of people didn’t know there was a campaign going on. how many days?
	•	Petros: i think ten days is good. I think the election shouldn’t end on a wednesday either. 
	•	Jamie: Coming from the perspective of someone who has run a campaign, the first two days of signature getting are technically part of the campaign. 
	•	Noah: to clarify, the way the election is written, candidates must gather 300 signatures to be eligible to run. That would take place from the 30th to april 1st, a wednesday.
	•	Kenny: If it’s ten days, then voting would happen on a friday or a saturday. I think people tend to shut their minds off on the weekend. I think 7 days is enough, assuming that competition is significant.
	•	Kevin: have you considered having the ballot open for longer as a solution to increase turnout?
	•	Dana: thats a posibility
	•	Isaac: is there a necesity to have a discreet petition period and a discrete campaign period, instead of having the petition be a deadline within the campaign.
	•	Dana: that’s a possibility.
	•	ground flying is a possiblity, but i think 800 sheets is a lot. i think we can bring that down to 500 sheets, and with the increase of chalk i think that’s fine. 
	•	Dana: in my experience, in the past two elections, every campaign used every sheet. it’s also in the guidelines that here are campaign materials we give the students, but there’s also a budget for the students to increase everything else. so they can buy more chalk. 
	•	Noah: any other comments thoughts concerns?
	•	Now who has the final decision on these suggestionss?
	•	Dana: we are going to meet and go over everything. Then you guys vote up or down, it only needs a majority to pass. to amend it needs 2/3rds. if you have an amendment you feel strongly about it would probably be easier to talk to us.
	•	Christina; maybe we could have a trial period for flyering? if we could even reduce to 700 or 600 or 500 as a trial period, see if the election was negatively affected. more creative alternatives could be substituted.
	•	moving on to new business ...
	•	New Business: SR1415-06: Resolution on Student Conduct Hearings
	•	Lauren: I thought we already had a special board for it. 
	•	Julia: They just took students off of those boards. The reason for that was because the White House suggested that students be taken off. 
	•	Chris: The White House said it created uncomfortable situations between students. On the reverse side of that, it also means you only have older adults on the board. There are culture changes over time, so it is super important to have students on the board. 
	•	Liz: The legislation does say that students could opt in or opt out of that. 
	•	New Business: SL1415-10: Undergraduate Discrimination and Harassment Act 2015
	•	Petros: You might be asking yourself why this is necessary. To be honest, I’ve always wondered why there is no amendment like this. I know that student groups are often required to put these kinds of things in their Constitution, so I’m surprised the student government does not have it. This version also has more groups protected than the university clause. 
	•	Who decided on these categories?
	•	Petros: I looked into legislation from all around the world and at other universities and I determined from those that there are some categories that Northwestern doesn’t cover. That’s fine, but we could have an internal policy that is more expansive. 
	•	Daniel: I still don’t understand how this will function beyond being codified. 
	•	Petros: I think you’re correct in some sense, because it does have symbolic value. I think it’s important for people who deal with us to know that we do not allow discrimination. Even if it was just that alone, I think it would be worthy. I excluded judicial function because I don’t think it’s ASG’s purview to institute reparative justice for discrimination, because the judicial board is not trained in that. It’s for student groups to know that is not allowed and for ASG members to know that also. 
	•	Lauren: It just means that when you’re on ASG business you can’t discriminate, but you don’t have to like everyone personally? 
	•	Petros: Yeah, clearly that’s not possible, because we’re humans. Privately held beliefs are private and you can hold those. I didn’t do this in response to anything from ASG, but bias incidents on campus. 
	•	Isaac: My concerns aren’t about adjudicating individual cases, but what if a student group we fund does something that is considered discriminatory? I think this would obligate us to defund them and I don’t think we have the judicial right to do that. 
	•	McKenzie: In the current guidelines, though we are doing review, there is not a certain thing that says that directly. It could be a misconduct that is reviewed annually. 
	•	Isaac: I don’t want this to be construed as a technical question, but the Constitution goes over the code and the financial guidelines. Is this the intent? Is there a way to change the constitutional amendment to clear that up? 
	•	Petros: It currently just covers ASG policies and it depends how the clause is interpreted. 
	•	Isaac: My second question is, considering the fact that the Constitution is currently four pages and this is over a page and a half, do you think this might make our Constitution more complicated and confusing? 
	•	Petros: It would make it longer, but I think it’s important to have this in there. 
	•	New Business: SL1415-11: Off-Campus Election Code Changes
	•	Noah: The idea here is that off-campus Senators in the past have been underrepresented. All the current slots have been filled by myself and the caucus whip, which doesn’t seem very democratic. The way it would work is off campus people need 25 signatures of people who live off campus and submit that to the Election Commission. The names would then be added to the ballot for off campus students. Through preferential voting, 8 people will be selected. 
	•	Lauren: Didn’t we already vote on something like this? 
	•	Noah: We discussed the idea, but not the actual code change. 
	•	Kenny: One concern that came up in caucus, is it required that you have to rank all of them? If you don’t know a majority of them, it could be arbitrary. 
	•	Noah: You can’t rank just some of them based on the Schulze method, but we are going to try to make students more knowledgeable about the people. It is not the place of the representative of the voter to decide, if they want to decide arbitrarily, that’s their personal vote. 
	•	Lauren: These Senators are elected the beginning of Spring Quarter. What if you are living on campus and then off campus? Can people run? 
	•	Noah: Yes, you are still able to run. 
	•	Roll Call and Adjournment



Northwestern University
Associated Student Government
Meeting of the Senate
January, 28, 2014
 
	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	General Order: Divvy Biking Survey
	•	Noah has not taken this survey. 
	•	General Order: Student Group Senate Seat Apportionment 
	•	Andrew: As you guys hopefully know, there is a student group caucus. We review that caucus every year and the groups that are represented. It is a very important process. We are starting that process. The reason I am presenting it, it requires a majority vote from Senate. Basically they will be due and we will spend a week interviewing and then present to Senate. There is a link in the agenda that has similar questions to what we will be asking. 
	•	Passes unanimously. 
	•	New Business: SL1415-12 Amendment to Mental Health Working Group
	•	Chris:  Just wanted to check in with you all. If you remember 6 weeks ago I asked to create a working group to determine the mental health landscape of campus. We met twice before break and then the exec board got caught up in other things. Rather than rushing, we want to push it back and give you feedback by the end of the quarter. 
	•	Chris: Motion to move to old business. 
	•	Isaac: Objection. I just want to remind you of when you wanted to rush this project. 
	•	Ariel: If it is supposed to be presented, then what happens if it does not get moved to old business?
	•	Chris: I will stand up here and make something up. 
	•	Alec: It doesn’t matter either way. 
	•	Isaac: Withdrawn. 
	•	Noah: We will hear it at the end. 
	•	PQ
	•	Passes unanimously. 
	•	New Business: SL1415-13 Amendment to ASG Feedback Working Group
	•	Chris: If you remember 6 weeks ago I asked to create a working group to determine ASG’s impact on campus. We met twice before break and then the exec board got caught up in other things. Rather than rushing, we want to push it back and give you feedback by the end of the quarter. 
	•	Chris: Motion to move to old business. 
	•	No objections. 
	•	PQ
	•	Passes unanimously. 
	•	New Business: SL1415-14 Name Changes and Code Cleanup
	•	Erik: Basically this is to make sure the code is actually updated. Sometimes legislation might not cover the entire part of the code it impacts, sometimes the code does not reflect our practices, etc. There are many changes, but they are summed up in the points in the principle. The most notable thing is changing the SAFC and the SGC to the A-Status Finances Committee and the B-Status Finances Committee. It would also change the name and abbreviations. You also may remember when we passed the Analytics committee it was an ad hoc committee, so we are going to codify that. We are removing the Operations Committee, because it does not exist. We are removing the VP of Technology and instead having a Director of Technology position under the Chief of Staff. The rest and also the Constitutional Amendment parts are adding things that were parts of legislation in the past. 
	•	Isaac: There is a part under the A-Status that says all funding requests need to go through A-status, so maybe look at that? 
	•	Motion to remove forum. 
	•	No objections. 
	•	New Business: SR1415-07 Active Consent on College Campuses 
	•	Petros: Active Consent, Affirmative Consent, whatever you want to call it, is a concept that requires that you get explicit confirmation before sexual activity. California recently passed a law requiring all college students on campuses receive active consent. I’m going to read from the law, “ “Affirmative consent” means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. It is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure that he or she has the affirmative consent of the other or others to engage in the sexual activity. Lack of protest or resistance does not mean consent, nor does silence mean consent.” It also includes other provisions, like about alcohol. I am asking that ASG encourage the Illinois General Assembly to pass a similar law. 
	•	Lauren: So you can’t consent at all if you’re the least bit intoxicated? 
	•	Petros: The CA law says the accused cannot claim consent if asleep or unconscious, or if the complainant was incapacitated due to the influence of drugs, alcohol, or medication, so that the complainant could not understand the fact, nature, or extent of the sexual activity; or the complainant was unable to communicate due to a mental or physical condition
	•	Johnny: Is there a reason why this is limited to college students? 
	•	Petros: I wrote it that way because there is precedent in CA. Ideally that would apply to everybody, but this is precedential. 
	•	Christina: Does this require lobbying? 
	•	Dana: No, but they can use it as a tool. 
	•	Old  Business: Election Guidelines Review
	•	Dana: most of this is the same as last week but we’ve taken some htings into condisideration. 3 things wev’e changed are the timelline: candidates can start their campaign on the second day of classes; the end of the election peroiod is the following friday, approx. 10 days. Another thing we changed ts that we extended the amount of time students can vote. The election period will end april 10, and there weill be a 24hr voter period. WE also adjusted flyering, so that only 600 are allowed. The final change from last week is to adjust voting booths so that they can only be set up y the election commission. Everything else is the same - on thing we didn’t change is that election committee will be in conjunction with the services committee. 
	•	Noah: Questions?
	•	C: can you clarify why you chose the voting period?
	•	Dana: before it was midnight to 7pm. we thought b/c voting was on a friday it woud be good if they had thursday to vote as well.\
	•	Noah: we will now enter dbate
	•	PQ
	•	Seconded
	•	Voting:
	•	“Aye”
	•	Noah: that passes
	•	passes unanimously
	•	Noah: next we will move into our next piece of old business SR1415-6
	•	Old  Business: SR1415-06: Resolution on Student Conduct Hearings
	•	Jonathan: Are any other schools adopting similar resolutions? 
	•	Julia: All the other schools at the Big 10 Conference will be having similar resolutions. 
	•	Noah: Moving in to debate period. 
	•	PQ
	•	No objections. 
	•	Passes unanimously. 
	•	Old  Business: SL1415-11: Off-Campus Election Code Changes
	•	Basically it will be attached to the presidential ballot, students will say where they are going to live the following year - we think someone planning to live off the next year can serve in the off-campus caucus and vote accordingly, since they will be living off for most of their term - off-campus students will be sent to ballot with the election guidelines. 
	•	Alec: How does that relate to the Election Commission? 
	•	Noah: You cannot be on the Election Commission if you are running. 
	•	Grace: What is the campaigning policy? 
	•	Noah: It is not specifically outlined. 
	•	Isaac: What is your response to the fact that this is happening at the same time as the election, and it is possible for candidates to stack a slate of eight senators underneath them. 
	•	Noah: I am not concerned about that. If a candidate is doing that, they could be impeached. 
	•	Grace: If you are on a campaign, do you get an unfair advantage? 
	•	Noah: I don’t think so. 
	•	Petros: In terms of filling vacancies, nothing is changed? 
	•	Noah: No. 
	•	Grace: If not enough people run, what happens? 
	•	Noah: It’s not outlined in this code change, but I’d imagine it would be the same as when Residential elections are not competitive. 
	•	Grace: Wouldn’t it reflect poorly if nobody ran? 
	•	Noah: I don’t think so. I think it reflects more poorly that everyone in the current caucus is appointed. 
	•	Alec: Motion to amend. Motion to add “The Election Commission will write and review rules specific to the Off-Campus election and will administer the elections.” to the end of code. 
	•	Grace: Why are we choosing the Election Commission? 
	•	Isaac: Bureaucracy. 
	•	Nehaarika: I think it’s necessary that it should be somewhat similar to what we have for residential senators. 
	•	Grace: I don’t think it should be the election commission who writes the rules, because it would really limit who could serve who could serve on the Election Commission. 
	•	Nehaarika: Does that mean people on the Election Commission cannot run for Residential Senators? 
	•	Noah: In the past they have resigned before that election.
	•	Isaac: This doesn’t mean if you want to be a residential or off campus senator you can’t be on the election commission, but for those given elections you cannot serve. 
	•	Grace: Motion to amend. Instead of the Election Commision. An Off-Campus Election Commision with four people from the Election Commission, the Election Commissioner, and two other elected students. 
	•	Petros: We got rid of an extra commission because it was bureaucratic. If you want to run for a position, it should take precedence over the Election Commission. 
	•	Grace: I think we as students can prioritize running for a Senate position and being on the Election Commission. Students should have the opportunity to do both. 
	•	Isaac: Here is my thing here. I don’t agree with your points, but I can see why they are worth having. I think we should pass this because we are not debating the meat of the amendment Alec brought up and then you can bring that up later as a separate code change.

	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
	•	The minutes were approved. 
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	General Order: Welcome Back! 
	•	General Order: Wild Ideas Fund
	•	Serene: The 10K Initiative and the Project pool we are going to have the Wild Ideas funds. The idea is that it should be pretty fast and not much red tape to access this money, which is unusual. You all approved this in the budget last spring and we decided to have a separate committee to look over submissions. The committee would be composed of the EVP, Vice President for Student Activities, SARC, one representative from SAFC, one from SGC, and two from campus. . The idea wouldn’t be you don’t get money if you don’t have a SOFO account, but rather look at what the student group needs and whether it’s feasible. 
	•	Alex: Students don’t have to be affiliated with a group, but if they have a cool idea, we want to be able to support that. Currently, our funding model does not allow for that flexibility. This is hopefully an infrastructure that will allow us to do that more efficiently and the committee will be there to help students with logistical issues and making sure the event happens. 
	•	Serene: There would be two representatives from SARC that will be able to help out. THe EVP with also be on the committee to oversee the nitty gritty parts and maintain accountability. 
	•	Alex: The SGC and - will be there 
	•	Serene: Funding requests would be submitted on a rolling basis and we’ll try to reduce overprogramming. 
	•	Erik: These ideas are supposed to help out the community in some way - fill a gap, be accessible to everyone. It is really supposed to promote new things. 
	•	Alex D.: How will we avoid the problem of giving more money in the fall and less in the spring when it is drying up? 
	•	Serene: That won’t necessarily be a problem because we know when the A and B status groups are happening and will take that timing into an account. It will be less of an issue because of that. We want to give out more money for quarters with less programming. 
	•	Alex: We want to set money aside quarterly, so that should help also. 
	•	Wendy: Are there restrictions for how many people can apply and how much they apply for? 
	•	Serene: Case by case, so there is no limit. 
	•	Alex: But we will also be able to ask groups to lower their amounts after submitting their proposal. 
	•	Korri: Since this is encouraging new fresh ideas, is there going to be committee that they go through first? 
	•	Serene: The wild ideas committee. 
	•	Kenny: Is this a combo of the Project Pool and the 10K? 
	•	Serene: That was just the wording I chose. 
	•	Kenny: Groups used to use the pool for supplementary funding, but this seems like it is for non-student groups. How do we know groups won’t just switch over?
	•	Serene: It will be by a case by case basis, but we’ll be watching it very closely. It’s not just for non-student groups though, because it is also open to their new events. 
	•	Alex: We want to build in some kind of ASG accountability measure. 
	•	Bella: Will Senate approve the ideas? 
	•	Serene: That’s why we are talking about this today! But we do want to minimize the red tape, because it is supposed to be spontaneous. 
	•	Alex: For the contracting process, advance time is helpful. We want this to be able to happen quickly, but to involve Senate in the process.  
	•	Moira: Is there a plan for how we are going to advertise so all students know? 
	•	Serene: I’ve already been in contact with Jaime and we are going to have a full campaign. It will be the first thing on the ASG Website as well. 
	•	Alex: It’s already in our fliers in residential halls, also. 
	•	Julia: We are taking a similar strategy from the 10K. 
	•	Serene: Anything funded through the Wild Ideas Fund will have to mark it that way. 
	•	Moira: If we didn’t have to have all of the Senate approve all projects, maybe there should be a weekly presentation from the committee. So everyone knows what is being approved and we can discuss it if there is an issue. 
	•	Nick: Have you thought about looping in RHA, RCB, PHA, IFC, etc.? Have you thought about collaborating or looping in their process?
	•	Serene: I guess this is an additional source with a lot more money. We can talk about them in terms of funding and making students aware of all the ways they can get funding. 
	•	Erik: This is a bit different in that we are encouraging individuals and most things that go through those organizations is sponsorships and we are less likely to do that. 
	•	General Order: Senate and ASG Recruitment
	•	Noah: Now we are going to do a recruitment exercise. Log onto your facebook and twitter. There are different pages and hashtags to use, so use them! You probably posted a cat gif this morning and it probably did worse for your facebook that posting this status. Go ahead and do that now! If it makes you feel better, you can tag me in it. 
	•	Jaimie: Tweet! I want to retweet you. I’m begging to retweet you. 
	•	Noah: You can follow @Star_Noah. 
	•	General Order: Plan for Next Week
	•	Noah: Next week there will be new senators by next week. One of the things I want to do is make the atmosphere more inclusive. I would appreciate if we could reduce barriers to participation: introduce yourself to new faces and spread out and leave in between spaces. I’ll remind you to say your name and who you represent, also to speak slowly and avoid acronyms. The only acceptable acronym is ASG. That is really all I have there. If you live in a Res Hall or Community, make an effort to reach out to students. They have until October 3rd at midnight to get their petitions signed.

Northwestern University
Associated Student Government
Meeting of the Senate
October, 8, 2014

	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	General Order: Welcome Residential Senators! 
	•	The new senators all took the oath! 
	•	General Order: Bicycling in Evanston
	•	Kevin: We have two guests tonight from the City of Evanston. 
	•	Ilda: I work for the City of Evanston, so welcome if you are new to the area - we are happy to have you here. I’m here to talk about a few quick things. I handle a lot of the transit issues the city deals with and work on our bike program, which is in its infancy. We did a city wide survey to poll our residents about transit. We were out at different facilities around the city asking people questions. I’ve been working with Kevin to try to get info from students as well, so please take the survey.  The goal is to gauge what is working and what isn’t for transit. The next steps for the transit survey is to present that to our parking and transportation committee and eventually to the council to provide guidance on what to do with that information. The third step is to work with transit partners on how to improve the bus system and if there is an opportunity to do anything with the purple line. Our bike program is new, but the objective is to work with our community partners and develop a campaign throughout the city that presents more biking safety and pedestrian and car safety. We are having some conflicts about lanes and what not, so one of the objectives this year is to start working on some outreach and working with a number of different community partners to talk about how to improve awareness about pedestrians and biking. We’re basically asking the university to continue to talk to us in terms of future bike lanes, improving safety and awareness and to stay active in what the city is working on. Our transportation and parking committee is where most of the conversation is going to happen this year. We also did some public commenting about the bike lanes this summer. The goal over the next year is to build a framework and to develop a better safety and awareness campaign and see if that is effective. We want to see if the city would need increased enforcement or if a bike ordinance would help. Evanston was awarded a 3 mil dollar grant to put up 8 bike sharing stations. We are determining the stations soon, we’ve done some analysis, but we’ll engage the committee to decide where they should go. We are looking to do a bike light giveaway soon, so keep your ears open for that! The tentative date is October 30th. Questions or comments? You can also contact me at bikes@cityofevanston.org
	•	Daniel: Most of my riding occurs on Sheridan Road. Has there been consideration of bike lanes there? 
	•	Ilda: There have! I don’t know about it for the short term, but last week the city council voted to postpone the bike lane suggestions. They are forthcoming, but not next year. 
	•	Kevin: We’ve been working on this and met with the aldermen in September and I can give you more information on where to voice your opinion. 
	•	Nicholas: What would the bike ordinance include?
	•	Ilda: I think it depends on the community engagement and awareness. It depends on what the problem is we need to solve, if we don’t need an ordinance to solve most of our problems, then we might not have one. But it is an option that we can consider. Some other cities have lesser fines for bicycle related things, right now the fine is the same as if you’re in a car. It really depends and we aren’t sure yet. 
	•	Nicholas: What do you think the problems are now? 
	•	Ilda: Motorists and bicyclists don’t know what the rules are and how they should be looking for bicyclists or if bicyclists are following all the traffic rules. 
	•	Nicholas: A big issue on campus is bike theft and it’s a big crime issue in Evanston. Is the city doing anything to fix that?  
	•	Ilda: I think it is something we should look at. Bike registration is important, but we have a low enrollment in our program. There is an opportunity to prevent a lot of that theft. 
	•	Kevin: Another big education thing is sidewalk usage. We are allowed to use sidewalks on campus and Sheridan, but it is not allowed in Evanston.
	•	Ilda: It’s only prohibited in the downtown districts, but it’s not really a safe option. We need to think about what those comfortable areas are and make it easier for everybody. 
	•	General Order: Community Relations Director of Technology Events Confirmation: Joji Syed
	•	Noah: Each exec member has a committee and if they want to restructure their committee and make people directors, then they need to present that person to the Senate and we can confirm them. 
	•	Kevin: CR Committee has never had director positions but have decided as a group to have them, especially focused on events. We do housing fairs, Cats Come to Dinner, etc. We do a lot of events and want to have one person that oversees those things. Joji has worked on a lot of those things already. 
	•	Joji: When Kevin reached out to me, I was very excited. I’ve worked on a lot of these events and I think I have the expertise and experience. I’ll aslo be coming in with a fresh pair of eyes and think of new ways to improve our committee. Hopefully you see me fit. 
	•	Isaac: Can you expand on the events you’ve run for CRC? 
	•	Joji: The biggest is definitely Cats Come to Dinner. You should all sign up, we are starting again soon. I also helped Chris with the Housing Fair last year. I also worked on consulting. Then there was the Holiday Bash in Evanston last summer. 
	•	Alex: Are you a part of any other committees?
	•	Joji: I am also on Alex’s committee, Student Groups. 
	•	Wendy: As director, how do you see your relationship with students and Evanston community, 
	•	Joji: My hope is to make everything more transparent and to make the communication for open ended. I want to facilitate students and student groups make connections with the community. 
	•	Chris: What is your title? 
	•	Joji: It’s just Events Director. 
	•	Chris: Can it be Director for Events? Also, what does it mean to you? 
	•	Joji: I want to be an accessible resource to all ASG members. If you don’t want to reach out to Kevin, you can reach out to me. Also I’ve been working with ASG for awhile and I want people to look to me as a mentor. I want this to be more than just a title. We can definitely help your student groups and your individual experiences. 
	•	Noah: We are now moving into debates/endorsement periods.

	Questions:
	•	Chris: Are you biased? How will you abuse your power?? How will you handle when contentious issues arrise and you may or may not hve feelings
	•	Josh: I’m not biased. I’m new. I’ll use my powers for good
	•	Vicki: i’m not new. I’m not biased either, but everyone has toughts on things so you can see both sides on things. Will try to balance things in my mind.
	•	Nehaarika: a committee for learning. we’re here to counter bias - that’s why the checks and balances of government exists.
	•	Will: Good at tabling his bias. Just have to trust him.
	•	Dana: Of course i’m biased - but that’s not how you approach things on rules. you’re there to make sure people nderstand it, have freqently passed legislation that i don’t agree with.
	•	Isaac motins to vote, motion seconded
	•	Noah: we’re moving on to the endorsement period.

	•	Noah: are there any more endorsements? Seeing none, we’ll move on to voting.
	•	Dana: For this voting procedure, we’ll put down every person’s name, in order of preference. We’ll rank all 5.
	•	New Business: SL1415-01 For NU(Ad)Ventures: Wild Ideas Fund
	•	Serene: Senate approved an allocation of $20,000 and now we need to establish the committee. The Wild Ideas committee, with be the EVP, VP of Student Activities, two people from SARC, FVP, VP of Student Groups and two general students. The way the process works once apps come in, the Wild Ideas Committee will look at them and see if it is feasible. The funding model at NU traditionally has only been available to events that have already happened before. We want this to be more accessible and not have too long of a turn around time. Senate’s voice is important, but we also want to minimize red tape. The $500 dollar amount follows from precedent. Our PR plan would be to push this really hard and with all your help. We would do that from facebook, online, and with fliers. 
	•	Xavier: What kind of ideas would this be? 
	•	Isaac: There are three criteria: enhance community, be available to all of campus, and be creative 
	•	Serene: This was inspired by the Project Pool and the 10K Initiative. 
	•	Alex: The 10K Initiative went for three years. The winners were WIFI on the lakefill, picnic tables and library chairs. 
	•	Erik: The idea is to promote something new on campus. 
	•	Bella: The three points that it has to meet, does it have to meet all three? 
	•	Serene: Yes, all three. There is a contract that says that also. 
	•	Bella: Do you fund food? 
	•	Alex: TBD
	•	Bella: Student Groups who are already getting funding for specific events, can they get additional funding here? 
	•	Erik: It depends what they need the extra funds for. If it is simply that they don’t have enough money then no, but if they want to change something and the nature of the event, then they could apply. This is mostly to create something new. 
	•	Serene: That is why we are including SGC and SAFC members on the committee. 
	•	Kenny: How would this apply to SASA’s project pool request last year? 
	•	Isaac: I think generally what we are trying to do is not get too specific in this legislation. The Wild Ideas Committee needs to look at everything holistically, so hypothetically yes, maybe? 
	•	Erik: Anyone can apply and if we say no, we’ll try to send them to other resources. 
	•	Bella: Will Senate know who is rejected as well as who is approved? 
	•	Serene: Right now it’s just approvals that come in. 
	•	Bella: How transparent is this committee going to be? 
	•	Serene: The committee can establish their own guidelines, but what is really important is that there are two representatives from campus. 
	•	Augustin: What happens when it is less than $500? 
	•	Serene: Just the Wild Ideas Committee is involved. 
	•	Kenny: What is the pool again? 
	•	Erik: It’s $20,000 with potential $5000 extra from the administration. 
	•	Erik: Motion to move to old business. 
	•	Noah: Is there a second? Yes. Any objections? 
	•	Johnny: I think this is too big to decide right now. This is a lot of money and it is theoretically possible to spend the whole fund without contacting Senate once. 
	•	Noah: We are now in debate on whether to move it to old business. Johnny counts as a con. We are now in line for a pro. 
	•	Serene: We talked about this in the spring a lot. If we want to talk about the $500 part we can talk tonight. We need to start the PR push now so that people can use it and that the whole campus knows about the fund. We can talk about it tonight. 
	•	Noah: We are now in line for a con. 
	•	Johnny: I understand that we talked about this a lot this spring but not everyone was there for those discussions. I understand PR, but what is one week. 
	•	Wendy: I think it is important to recognize that we are already on week 3. We want students to use this money and we want them to be able to learn about it. 
	•	Isaac: PQ
	•	Noah: Is there a second? Yes. We are now going to vote. 
	•	Noah: By my ear that passes. We are now moving this to old business. We are in line with a con speech on the legislation. 
	•	Amol: Motion to amend. I think the $500 should be decreased to $250. From last year, a lot of claims were under $500. I don’t like that most requests could just go through the committee. 
	•	Johnny: Motion to table for 15 minutes. 
	•	Noah: That does not pass. We are in line for discussion on the amendment.  We are in line with a con. 
	•	Moira: I was going to motion to do a different amendment. I think that if it is less than $500, then Senate will approve those as a slate and not individually. 
	•	Bella: I would say this is a good idea. I think that $500 is kind of high and like Johnny said, potentially they could continuously approve $500 over and over and then the money is gone. I think $250 is more reasonable. It is half of $500. I also think that there will be fewer proposals that are less than $250. 
	•	Lauren: I thought there was an option to present requests to the student body. Is that in there? 
	•	Serene: It’s not outlined, but the committee could. 
	•	Moira: If we keep the same guidelines but lessen to $250, we would have to discuss each individual item in Senate. It will take more time in Senate. 
	•	Augustin: This will still lessen the time and I don’t think we should just try to reduce the time in Senate. 
	•	: On average how much of a difference do you think this would make? 
	•	Alex: I don’t know, I think it is more about Senate’s comfort levels. 
	•	: It seems like a lot of people have issues with the amendment because of the time in Senate, so we could do what Moira suggested and pass a slate for $250-$500. 
	•	Isaac: I think the it’ll take longer talk, it’s our decision if it takes longer. It depends on us whether we think a proposal should have a lot of debate. 
	•	Moira: If it is over $500, does that mean the group comes in an present? 
	•	Serene: The Wild Ideas Committee would present, not the actual groups. 
	•	Alex: We noticed student groups would be bombarded at Senate and it was not the best atmosphere, so the Wild IDeas Committee will advocate on behalf of the group. 
	•	Wendy: I think it is important to remember the purpose is for wild ideas. We want students to be able to bring out their ideas. I should not be that complicated of a procedure for them to get the money. I think $500 is not that much. And we need to have trust in our committee. 
	•	Noah: That ends debate period. We will now vote. A yes vote would change the amount to $250, no is to leave the legislation as is. 
	•	Division
	•	Favor: 10, Opposed: 15, Abstained: 2
	•	Noah: The amendment fails, it will remain $500. We are now debating the legislation and we are in line for a con. 
	•	Bella: If the money isn’t used fully does it roll over? 
	•	Serene: Yes. 
	•	Moira: Motion to amend. Any application that the Wild Ideas Committee approves under $500 would have to be approved as a slate in Senate and anything above $500 would be considered individually. 
	•	Chris: Is this going to be presented as a general order? Wouldn’t that mean it would always be a slate, so this would require not a slate for above $500. 
	•	Serene: The way the language currently stands the Wild Ideas Committee could present everything as a slate anyways. I don’t think above or below $500 needs to be different. 
	•	Isaac: I motion to table this for a week. 
	•	Any objections: 
	•	Wendy: Yes. I think that the purpose of Wild Ideas is to facilitate this for students. 
	•	Isaac: As an author I think it is important to table this, because the language is unclear. If we want to make rules, then we should make sure that they are really clear. 
	•	Kenny: I get that and we should try to make this great, but I know student groups that are waiting. We should PR this regardless of what this looks like. We need to make sure students know there is money if they have good ideas. The issues can be worked out later. 
	•	Noah: We are now going to vote on the motion to table. 
	•	Favor: 8, Opposed: 16, Abstained: 1
	•	Noah: That fails, so we are now back in discussion. We are in line for a con. 
	•	Serene: The way that this legislation was presented it could be that everything was proposed as a slate above $500. Why not just divide things as need be? 
	•	Daniel: Can you explain what a slate is? 
	•	Noah: Everything would be presented at once and voted on together. 
	•	Wendy: Is it a general order? 
	•	Noah: It would be a special order. 
	•	Moira: Motion to amend. Can you change it to be could be individually instead of would be? That way they are not obligated to make it individual. 
	•	Noah: This is now the amendment we are discussing. We are in line for a con on the amendment. 
	•	Ruba: When it says unilaterally approved, does that mean Senate doesn’t hear about the ones that are under $500. 
	•	Serene: The committee would not have been obliged to present. 
	•	Erik: Anything over $250 is included in my exec board report. 
	•	Serene: I don’t think it needs to be outlined specifically since dividing is part of procedure. 
	•	Ruba: We want to be aware of the funding. We just want to make sure it is presented in Senate. 
	•	Johnny: I think the new amendment just erased the distinction between above and under $500. 
	•	Noah: Debate period is now over. 
	•	Kenny: Is there a motion to general discussion?
	•	Noah: You can move to extend debate period. 
	•	Kenny: I move to extend debate period by 5 minutes. 
	•	Noah: We are extending debate. 
	•	Moira: I think it would be helpful for the committee to have to present all the under $500 at once. 
	•	Bella: I think to echo Serene, this is something that could easily happen with regular Senate procedure. 
	•	Ruba: This is not pointless or repetitive, because without this amendment, we won’t see projects that are under $500. 
	•	Bella: We had a chance earlier to reduce it to $250 and we chose not to, if $500 is the question. 
	•	Noah: We will now vote. 
	•	Division: 
	•	Favor: 13, Opposed: 13. The amendment fails. 
	•	Will: Motion to reconsider. 
	•	Johnny: Motion to roll call. 
	•	Noah: The motion fails, 14 to 14. 
	•	Motion to amend. Anything under $150 automatically passed, anything $150-$500 would be presented as a slate, and anything above $500 could be considered individually. 
	•	Serene: I think the slate differentiation is not necessary and is confusing. 
	•	Isaac: Motion to amend. Anything under $150 can be passed by the committee without Senate approval, anything $150-$500 would be presented but not voted on and anything above $500 would be voted on. 
	•	Noah: We are in line for a con. 
	•	PQ
	•	Noah: If you vote in favor we will alter the amendment. That passes. We are now discussing this amendment. 
	•	PQ
	•	Noah: We will now vote on the amendment. That passes. Now we are in line to vote on the legislation. 
	•	Passes unanimously. 
	•	New Business: SL1415-02 C.R.E.A.M. : Student Leadership Stipend Committee
	•	Erik: Last spring we approved $10000 to fund a student leadership stipend program. Students with a demonstrated financial need have a barrier to participating in leadership positions. This is just approving the committee structure and saying that the EVP can select the committee. I would serve as the chair and pull together members from across the student body, not just ASG. This committee is going to meet this year, but not continue on later. 
	•	Johnny: The members will all be appointed by EVP? 
	•	Erik: Yes. 
	•	Moira: Would it count as a committee requirement? 
	•	Dana: Nope. 
	•	Kenny: Does this committee have the final say on who gets the awards? 
	•	Erik: No. As soon as financial aid is considered, students are blind to the process. This is for the merit process and checking to see what the responsibilities of their positions are. 
	•	Noah: That ends the question and answer period. 
	•	Good of the Order & Announcements
	•	Roll Call and Adjournment
 
	•	Ani: were going to go ahead and get started with some executive board reports,

	•	Please give us your feedback and your ideas. 
	•	Brandon: you guys should consider running for a seat if you want to get a better pulse of what’s going on in senate, 
	•	Victor: it’s your job to talk to your communities to give us feedback because we are looking for ways to really improve NU. It’s not easy to go up to strangers and ask them how you would like to see us improve. But its really your job to be very conscious, I think along the way you will learn how to build a community
	•	Our projects are pretty collaborative, you have to come to meetings each week but in no way should that constrain you, if you are passionate than there is no reason why you can’t work on these projects. 
	•	Ani: again to welcome you guys, in the next few weeks we will be sitting down with each of you to let us know what we are working on. 
	•	Tony Kirchmeier: im the director of off campus life in the dean of students office, we have a new student position starting in January: off campus ambassador that is going to help us pull and distribute information and plan activities, we are going to start off with ward 4, 5 and 7.

	•	TK: estimated 10 to 12, I think we are going to tweak it, we are going to be working on what works and what doesn’t work 
	•	Mark: what will be your relationship with Steven?
	•	TK: Steven is one of the members of the off campus student advisory board committee, we spent Monday night together
	•	X: can it be counted as a work-study job?
	•	TK: yes, I believe so, its 500$ a quarter. 
	•	Ani: SGC committee confirmations
	•	Lauren: the SGC and SAFC are the groups that make recommendations to you guys that senate can accept. I have to recommend people to put on my committee, and this is your guys chance to ask them questions because they are dealing with the SAF. 
	•	Charlie: I am a sophomore transfer; I am really excited to be working on this committee. I’m planning on pursuing Econ and Poli sci, this is a really good way for me to get involved and I want to really just make the most of my time here,
	•	Danielle: I’m a freshman, excited to work for the SGC if you approve. I am thinking of doing a double major in Econ and Legal studies, it’s a very important component of the undergraduate experience. 
	•	Ian: what’s your favorite student group?
	•	Charlie: ISBE, besides ASG of course
	•	Danielle: I just joined an a capella group so I really like that
	•	X: what school did you transfer from

	•	Victor: in the spring we allocated 480$ from the spring project pool, for the library, there were 6 mac book chargers that you can rent for 3 house, you can check it out, it’s a dollar per hour for an overdue fee, if you don’t give it back after 7 days you have to pay to replace it for 90$. We are publicizing it so tell your friends, 
	•	You get it for 3 hours for free and then 1 dollar for every extra hour. 
	•	Is it both Mac and PC
	•	Only Mac for now, it’s a pilot so we will gage and see how it goes. 
	•	Brad: as you can see we had free pizza today, that’s not normal, Norris just opened a new pizza place called Northshore pizza. They gave it to us looking for student feedback. 
	•	Too much oregano 
	•	Needs more tomato sauce
	•	Too much crust: too starchy too crunch
	•	Lauren: NOO!!!

	•	Ani: (caucus break out)
	•	Ani: Caucus Whips: Sarah Brock, greek, Lauren Johnson RHA RCB, Paul Koscumb Student Groups Ian Coley Off-Campus
	•	Brandon: Rules Elections
	•	John Kim, Ian, Dana, Nalin, Corey, Petros, Rebecca 
	•	John Kim: IFC representing Fiji, detail oriented, a good understanding of rules. I am a quick learner. I am always looking for more opportunities to get involved
	•	Ian: I have been in ASG for a long time and I have written a lot of legislation, I am very nit-picky, and I have been around a long time and I know how the rules work
	•	Dana: sophomore, I was a senator all of last year for 3 quarters, I held a temp position all of last quarter. Want to be a SC Justice
	•	Nalin: I was a senator for the 2010/11 academic year. I have experience with the govt services, started up my own company, have done a lot of work correcting papers
	•	Corey: new to senate, interested in getting as involved as possible, working for high school news paper, 
	•	Petros: sophomore representing Plex, I want to be a teacher, perfectionist streak, Basically, I am committeeless, I can devote all my time to rules, 
	•	Rebecca Sheeber, I represent the college republicans, I have some ideas for legislation but I am still a little new to this. I am really excited about being a little more involved in ASG. 
	•	Evan: what makes you better suited than other candidates
	•	John: I don’t have as much experience as other groups but I was an intern at a research and consulting company my job would be to advise companies based on what I learned but I am a detail oriented person
	•	Ian: What makes me better is that I have read the code and I have written a lot of bills myself that didn’t need a lot of improvement so when it comes to knowing the code I think I am the most experienced person up here, 
	•	Dana: last year, I have been working with Roberts rules since I was 13. I wrote the page in the student handbook
	•	Nalin: I was on the rules committee, I worked in an investigative branch involving police officers, in addition my past 2 internships I served as a research analyst at banks. I am a quick learner and good with details,
	•	Corey: I don’t have that kind of experience but I do have experience from my high school newspaper but I am a quick learner
	•	Petros: I don’t have as much experience, but I do have extraordinary amounts of time. I have no other committeemen’s other than ASG. I don’t really yell at people, I am very tactful about telling people to pt a comma in
	•	Rebecca: this summer I worked for a senator drafting and editing legislation. Yes people up here have more experience than I do, getting me in on this committee would be a good investment because I am willing to devote myself to this committee for the rest of my time here. 
	•	Neal: suppose I wrote a bill and it sucks, how will you tell me?
	•	Ian: I understand you haven’t been in senate, you need more “whereas”’s. 
	•	Dana: okay so most of your content is good, you’re on the right track but we need to work on the format, we can write this together. 
	•	Nalin: you have the right idea, with your bill however it doesn’t fit the write format for senate and we can’t allow it to pass in this form. You can go through it with us now or make the necessary changes. 
	•	Corey: We can work on it together
	•	Petros: we can work on getting the formalities of the bill nailed out. You didn’t respectfully submit it
	•	Rebecca: I’m really proud of you, obviously you’re committed to this idea and this concept; next time you come it’s going to be perfect and awesome. 
	•	John: there is no reason for the format to be wrong because it is online, if you don’t have the formatting its fine we can work that out for you,
	•	Brandon: you also have to be on the judicial board, can you state when you have been objective in the past and do you think you will be able to stay objective
	•	Dana: I have had leadership positions in the past where I have chaired different committees. When you know people you have to take their feelings into account but you have to be objective. 
	•	Nalin: in the past I have been in this situation, there was a case with absences in senate, and they ended up taking a break from senate. My experience with the police force you have to be objective
	•	Corey: I can site specific experience, but I am rather objective
	•	Petros: I can be passionate but only when its appropriate, 2 years ago when I was in high school one of my cast members never showed up and I had to replace him and it was important that I didn’t patronize but to find a solution
	•	Rebecca: I am on the judicial board of my sorority; I am also on the Weinberg school advisory judicial board that deals with some academic integrity cases. 
	•	John: I had to go through applications and reject a fair amount of my close friends and its really tough but you have to know what’s right and what’s wrong and know that its for the better
	•	Ian: I am on a tutoring committee and I would have to encourage a lot of my friends to apply and then cut them. I have done elections for RCB twice and presidential elections are pulled from within the group and it’s really tough. 
	•	Any: First piece of legislation is the Chief of Staff
	•	Brad: This piece of legislation requires many changes to the code, has been debated in Senate for a couple of years. Four years ago, there was a Director of HR in ASG, which turned into the Executive VP position. Since then, EVP has evolved to deal with internal accountability and sits on a lot of committees outside of ASG, becoming a much bigger position than originally envisioned. EVP no longer has time to deal with HR and recruitment. Brandon and Ani have taken up a lot of responsibility for senator recruitment and VPs have taken up a lot of responsibility for committee member recruitment. Many aspects of internal management have fallen by the wayside. The Chief of Staff would centralize and streamline recruitment efforts and deal with surveys, performance reviews, etc. This legislation has been co-signed by the entirety of the exec board aside from Ani and Brandon, who must abstain. Would like to move to old business tonight
	•	Ian: Subsection 9, what minutes?
	•	Brad: Wednesday ASG exec meetings are open, Sunday meeting minutes are closed to exec only.
	•	Dana: If passed tonight, would we select tonight?
	•	Brad: Cabinet selection process. Would open up process immediately.
	•	Sarah: Why so many committees?
	•	Brad: There are many different roles.
	•	Isaac: Why is it just a code change?
	•	Brad: Constitutional change isn’t necessary. We will revisit in the future if the position is successful.
	•	Rebecca: When will application be due?
	•	Brad: Sunday night, interviews Monday and Tuesday, position for Wednesday.
	•	Michelle: Why was position eliminated?
	•	Brad: Tommy Smithburg created the position. He created the position and then took it as EVP. He eliminated the position and gave the duties to himself. Now my position handles a lot more internal accountability and internal organization
	•	Noah: so will you appoint a new person in the spring, 
	•	Motoki: back when it was the human resource director, was he election commissioner?
	•	Brad: no
	•	Isaac: I motion to move this to old business, 
	•	Seconded and Objected
	•	Ani: debate over moving this to old business
	•	Isaac: I don’t really see why we cant just discuss this now, 
	•	Brad: 2 things, I think if you want to further discuss this that is perfectly legitimate, another reason why we should move this to old business is because there is another piece of legislation that is dependant about how we vote on this. 
	•	CON: Mark: I signed onto this bill because I really like it but after looking at it more closely I think it is important that we let this get discussed not in this forum, 
	•	Henry: this is not time sensitive, 
	•	PRO: David: I think the issues are limited enough that they can be hashed out on the floor pretty quickly and I think it will require a lot of work on the exec board and it is important to get the ball rolling
	•	Con: Dana: I am uncomfortable moving anything to old business without talking to my caucus
	•	Steven: I am nervous that if this bill is moving in tandem with the clerk position that we let this see
	•	Henry: I wouldn’t want to pull a fast one on senate 
	•	Jesse: why not have this be one bill?
	•	Brad: we wanted to be able to pass the Chief of staff legislation even if the clerk wouldn’t pass
	•	VOTE: Will be brought up next week as New Business
	•	Brad: what this bill is going to do, this is already a large exec at 14 and we are trying to add another one, we are at the 84th percentile among other KOFI schools, we want to roll the clerical positions to the Parliamentarian position. Carly is being incredibly under utilized and the scope of her position is not allowing her to do so. 
	•	Motoki: is there a reason why you didn’t give the whole minute taking task to the Parliamentarian, 
	•	Brad: P is officer of senate; COF is an officer of the entire body. It makes more sense this way. 
	•	Rebecca: we elected Carly a quarter ago, why is she just be getting cut out?
	•	Brad: She would be nominated for Chief of Staff role. 
	•	We decided to make the decision that it didn’t make sense to just expand the role. 
	•	X: is there a possibility that carly is just a go-getter?
	•	Brad: were a 200 person organization would have a human resources director
	•	John: since you have this as 2 different pieces of legislation, assuming carly wants the COF. 
	•	Dana: what does changing the constitution mean? What other steps do we have to take?
	•	Ani: in terms of changing the constitution, senate has to ratify it by 2 thirds, it can be thrown into referendum (all of campus) senate has to hold at least one public forum a week before the amendment, so changing the constitution is far harder than the code. The clerk is mentioned in the constitution, 
	•	Henry: Motion to table it indefinitely until it is presented as a constitutional amendment. 
	•	Seconded
	•	Tabled indefinitely
	•	Student Group Apportionment Review: a process that takes place in which we have student groups apply for a seat. The process takes place in the beginning of fall quarter so the groups have enough time to select a senator. This is a very unfortunate time to do this process, they are not all the concerned with ASG. Because student groups transition in the beginning of spring quarter, someone was elected to do a job they thought they would have for the whole year and they now no longer have that seat. We would like to move this process to the end of winter quarter, the only change we would have to make, is to change the Chief of Staff who is supposed to 
	•	Motoki: it says the EVP is supposed to make the app, that should be COS
	•	Brad: last year asg passed the 5k initiative we are trying to make a couple enhancements and were trying to codify it so that is sits as a standing committee rather than an ad hoc committee, we are changing it from once a quarter to once a year and this will allow us to get more submission, there is also just not that much that we can do for 5k on this campus, the way this was originally funded was that ASG would put up 5k and it would be matched by student affairs. That will happen just once. The committee will work on getting submissions all fall quarter and right at the end of winter quarter we can vote. 
	•	Paul: you said 5k is coming from student affairs, the other 5k is in the ASG budget, in the future are you assuming that you will be pulling 10k from the ASG funds. 
	•	Yes
	•	Michele: were most of the ideas that were rejected last year doable with 10k rather than 5?
	•	Brad: yes, 
	•	Steven: originally it was 5k every quarter why is it not the 15k?
	•	Brad: 10k is more sustainable
	•	Ian: do you think student affairs will want a say in the final submission
	•	Brad: no, this is entirely our process
	•	X: how many students voted?
	•	697
	•	Motion to move this to old business
	•	PASSED
	•	Ani: this is now old business
	•	Henry: how are you going to get more people to vote?
	•	Brad: more time will allow us to better publicize this
	•	Alex: do you have any idea what is going to get cut?
	•	Brad: its coming out of the SAFC so its coming out of the student groups not ASG
	•	Ian: do you think taking 5k out of your budget is going to have an impact Girish?
	•	Girish: I think it’s a terrible idea.
	•	Jesse: is there any way that the school will pay for it?
	•	Brad: that’s not a match they are willing to match
	•	Henry: how much wasn’t used for the groups. 
	•	Girish: there is no surplus
	•	Alex: this is coming out of the 1.3 million?
	•	Brad: in our 46000 dollar budget, we have a line item out of this budget this year of 5000. 
	•	Jesse: can we allow donors to put their name on it?
	•	Rebecca: is there a way to do this without the 10000
	•	The legislation states that any money that is not used will be rolled into the next year, we can also select 2 winners. 
	•	Josh: say the most popular vote was a crappy idea, how would that be dealt with?
	•	Brad: the committee narrows down the 10 most feasible ideas and then those get put out for a final vote. 
	•	Sarah: could we only allocate 5k and if it is worthy add 10k
	•	Brad: senate can do what it wants but I don’t recommend that
	•	Mark: Student affairs agreed to match it this year?
	•	Brad: yes they agreed this year, we wanted to make the program better and only pass it this year. 
	•	Brad: I would advocate codifying it now so that it doesn’t get forgotten however if the reason that this doesn’t pass is because the future budget than I think you should strike it because I think its important. 
	•	Rebecca: 
	•	Ian: I think its more likely that Student affairs will be more likely to renew the 5k grant each year
	•	Jesse: how do we go about getting more money, how do we rally the school to support this?
	•	Brad: SAF: 52$ per quarter per student, any changes to that would have to be approved by the board of trustees, it would take a few years to change that. We have had some of those conversations to see if we can change that, it’s a project were working on, but its not sustainable for this bill. 
	•	Girish: it does grow every year. 
	•	Ani: debate on the legislation 
	•	Motion to table it for a week. 
	•	Motoki: it seems like there are a bunch of issues with the money that need to be hashed out, 
	•	Henry: we should table it, I don’t know how much this would affect other student groups, there are only 15 min left. 
	•	Brad: that is a piss poor reason 
	•	Henry: yeah but nobody wants to. 
	•	Brad: lets pass it for this year so we can get the show on the road and there is a lot of work to get done this quarter, we really only have until thanksgiving. Lets pass the rest of the bill later. 
	•	Girish: my only concern is to the money I love this program. 
	•	Dana: I think it is better to just amend it
	•	Mark: motion to amend, strike the line about future funding, the 2nd clause in the action.
	•	Debate on the Amendment
	•	Pro: Mark lets just get it on
	•	Motion to vote on the amendment
	•	PASSES. 
	•	Motion to PQ
	•	Motoki: is the selection process on the committee the same as last year?
	•	Brad: yes
	•	The legislation changes the position to be headed by the EVP rather than the president
	•	Ani: all in favor of passing this legislation?
	•	PASSED. 
	•	Rules winners: Dana, Ian, and Rebecca.

Northwestern University
Associated Student Government
Meeting of the Senate
October, 15, 2014

	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	General Order:  Housing Master Plan Presentation
	•	JPK: We’re going to walk you through how this came to be and show you the plans and how we are going to pay for the plan. Then we’ll take any questions. We are part of the division of Student Affairs. Our vision is to be full partners of the student experience and our mission is to enrich that experience. When we started this process, we identified six strategic goals. We knew we needed to focus on Undergraduate Housing, because students were concerned. We want to equalize the on campus experience through renovation and new construction. We heard that refreshing things all the time is not effective. The third goal is to reposition housing offerings to meet the market. We also want to increase the number of people living on campus. Our fifth goal is to make a phasing strategy and our sixth is to maintain consistency with Northwestern’s other long term plans. 
	•	Paul: We did a lot of market research using an outside firm, which brought an extra expertise that we found beneficial. They looked at off campus pricing, we did student surveys, peer institution research, determined demand, etc. We simultaneously did architectural analysis and budget analysis. We also did a series of focus groups. We learned that students’ first year experience is defined by housing, pricing is inconsistent, and we need to have upperclassmen housing available to students. Proximity was important people, apartment style housing was also very important. 
	•	JPK: We heard through ASG and UBC that if you just built apartments, we would stay on campus. We are not going to make everyone live on campus all four years and that not everyone can or wants to, especially because of internships and five year programs. We know that some landlords are doing a good job and others aren’t, so we don’t just want to gut that market. 
	•	Paul: Our capacity today is 3993 beds, we will demolish some beds, lose a few, and gain more through renovation and new construction, ending up at 4252 beds. Some sites are what used to be Peanut Row, MAB, Bobb-McCulloch will be demolished, and so would Sargent. The Fairchilds is considered academic space, but that has not been settled yet. Some buildings get reduced (286 beds) but they will be modernized to meet student needs. 
	•	Chris: What would that create?
	•	Paul: More space. If we took some beds out, then we can have more lounge space and open space. We still need to have enough revenue beds to keep the model working. 
	•	JPK: The numbers you don’t see here are new constructions, which generally leads renovation. This will give us more swing space. We have been trying to compress renovation into two or few months, but that doesn’t really work and it costs more money. So we will be constructing before renovating. 
	•	Paul: The renovations will not just be cosmetic, but also mechanical, like air conditioning. It would be a new building essentially from the inside out. It’s a big plan with lots of moving parts to it. 
	•	JPK: For the ones we are not renovating we don’t mean that we won’t fix anything and just let them sit for ten years, but they won’t have huge maintenance. 
	•	JPK: We tested a lot of different room styles through surveys and found that students felt that first year students need to live with a roommate. Generally, you’ve got a shared bathroom with two rooms that are double-occupancies as the top rated room style. For sophomores/juniors we got an individual room with a shared restroom and a little shared space that they are clustered around. We want to people to stay connected and not just shut out everything else. Conceptually these are the ideas we would use to develop our floor plans. 
	•	Paul: People really want restroom access in the rooms themselves, so we hear that loud and clear. 
	•	Paul: Construction will begin in 2014 on Lincoln, which should open in 2016. Each year progresses as we go through and the table shows what our room capacity will be each year. We need to build the new buildings first to absorb the reductions in the renovations. 
	•	JPK: Showed visual. 
	•	JPK: Why don’t we just tear Foster-Walker down? The zoning has changed, if we tear it down, we can’t build a residential building there. So we need to keep the skin. 
	•	JPK: More visuals. 
	•	Paul: How are we gonna pay for this? We have a bake sale starting tomorrow, brownies are $9,000 a piece. Residential Services doesn’t receive money from the University, but we can borrow it through them and pay it over time from rent from students. We just settled a $27 mil debt 10 days ago, but now we are going to be in debt again. Dining is not part of this, but we can talk about this later.
	•	Paul: $546 mil is what we are estimating the cost will be. Smaller maintenance would come out of a separate budget. The President is suggesting he can raise ~$50 mil to contribute to this. The funding approach is much like a mortgage and financially we will be able to do this. 
	•	Lauren: Have you considered adding more Res Colleges? 
	•	JPK: This is a facilities plan, so the programmatic changes are separate and would happen later. 
	•	Paul: Every building we are building we are mindful of what it would look like as either a hall, college or community. 
	•	JPK: They should have more flexible plans that would make programmatic changes easier. 
	•	Ronak: With respect to res colleges, how would closing it down affect their membership?
	•	JPK: Ideally we would take those people and move them collectively so they can stay together, because the Residential Colleges aren’t all about the building. 
	•	Nicholas: What’s happening to SAE? 
	•	JPK: That was a problem with the visual, nothing is happening to SAE. 
	•	Bella: Thoughts on dining halls? 
	•	JPK: There are going to be some pinch points with dining, like when Hinman gets dark. Hopefully the way construction on campus is going, there should be new dining options when that happens, like the new student center. Similarly, when Sargent is down, there should be something in the Bobb space. 
	•	General Order: Wild Ideas Fund Committee Elections
	•	Noah: We are now electing two students for the Wild Ideas Fund Committee, they do not need to be senators. I open the floor for nomanations. 
	•	Jonathan: I nominate Nick. 
	•	Nick: I accept.
	•	Isaac: I nominate Joji. 
	•	Joji: I accept. 
	•	Joji: I nominate Isaac. 
	•	Isaac: I don’t accept. 
	•	Ruba: I nominate Imtisal. 
	•	Imtisal: I accept. 
	•	Serene: I nominate Angie. 
	•	Angie: I accept. 
	•	Serene: I nominate Will. 
	•	Will: I accept. 
	•	Noah: Everyone please come up and stand in the order you were nominated. Please go down the line and introduce yourself. 
	•	Nick: I’m Nick, nice to meet you. I’m a sophomore and this is my second year on ASG. I want to be on this committee because I think ASG oversight is important, since we talked about this for so long. I think it’s important to have vocal senators on this committee. Secondly, I’ve done this sort of thing before. I was on RHA and we gave money to student groups that submitted proposals. Furthermore, I’d like to work with outside councils to pool money and produce better events. I’d like to bring those communities together to improve the process. 
	•	Joji: I’m on CRC as well as Student Groups. On Student Groups I work with funding and I have seen the funding process. This is similar, except that everyone can come up. I have that skillset but want to apply it differently. This committee makes a hands on impact and I think I have a diverse interest amongst different student groups I’m a part of as well as ASG. 
	•	Imtisal: I’m a senior and I am interested in this committee because I think it is new and necessary to give groups access to funding. I think it’s important to give different groups access to funding systems. I was part of an A status group but I was in charge of programming in that group that was not funded by the SAF. I also have experience on the Diversity and Inclusion Committee. 
	•	Will: I am a junior studying poli sci. I am a former Korean marine and I was driving tanks for two years. I want to join this committee, because I want to be as involved in Northwestern as I was with the marines. I think it is necessary to create a compact and mingling society. I used to work at a national assembly budgeting office, so I have that experience. I also worked at Samsung in their HR department so I had to look at a lot of resumes and condense information. 
	•	Angie: I’m a sophomore and I’m new to ASG, but I’m looking to devote a lot of my free time to devote energy to something this important. I’m excited to work with a brand new committee. My relevant experience, I have been involved with budgeting. I’m good at crunching numbers and reconciling budgets. I think this would be a fun opportunity. 
	•	Noah: Questions. 
	•	Kenny: Before Wild Ideas, do you think ASG had an inequitable funding model? 
	•	Joji: I think that Wild Ideas is good because of how open it is and that it is larger. We didn’t used to have such an open opportunity and I like this is available to more students. My understanding of last year is that students may have felt restricted. I think SAFC and SGC are working towards improvements and making sure that the system is more fair. I think it’s a work in progress but we are making good strides. 
	•	Imtisal: I’m going to be a little less diplomatic. It was not equal, which is not a knock to ASG, but it’s an issue of access and knowledge. Larger groups have more institutional memory, but other groups don’t have the ability to navigate the bureaucracyacy. I think the WIF will be a good step in the right direction. 
	•	Will: There is inequality, but it’s not a bad inequality. To promote within an student organization you need to have a goal. If you want to be A status, you need to work hard to get there. To get funding you need to improve your group. But I think the WIF Committee is important because it creates another atmosphere. 
	•	Angie: I agree. I think that this fund could help groups right from the start to help them form when they wouldn’t have otherwise. 
	•	Nick: I think there has been inequity in terms of how student groups get funding. The A status organizations that get the least still get way more than B statuses. This fund is for new events that those funding models can’t do. 
	•	Isaac: What do you think the WIF should fund? What do you think the general purpose is? 
	•	Imtisal: I am envisioning a fund that fosters creativity and new projects to shape Northwestern. 
	•	Will: I think the WIF should be more small student organizations that do not have the capacity. Including cultural ideas. 
	•	Angie: Small groups the funds to grow and groups to establish themselves. 
	•	Nick: Fun, entertaining events. UChicago does stuff from their slush fund. Like bouncy castles!
	•	Joji: I think the purpose is to help foster community regardless of what that community is. 
	•	Daniel: Which organizations do you think are overfunded and which are underfunded? 
	•	Will: I wouldn’t name a specific group, but I think some cultural organizations do not properly use their funding. I think groups that help the community should be increased. 
	•	Angie: I would need to do more research to answer that question, but I think it depends on what the students want.
	•	Nick: Funding isn’t a zero sum game and I think that’s a polarizing way to look at it. The decision should be made based on our values as an organization. 
	•	Joji: I would like to respectfully decline to answer that, but students should get the money they need achieve their goal. 
	•	Imtisal: On a similar note, I haven’t been to every SAF funding event so I can’t speak to that. I would just say that I am going to come into this without biases. The WIF Committee will have a lot of proposals that will not all be chosen, but hopefully we’ll choose events that will benefit the Northwestern committee. 
	•	General Order: Chief of Staff Selection Committee Nominations
	•	[Noah explains selection committee]
	•	2 students for chief of staff committee. We will now take nominations.
	•	kevin: I nominate Robin
	•	Robin accepts
	•	Alex: I nominate myself
	•	Noah: that closes nominations. Can the nominees please come to the front to introduce themselves?
	•	Robin: i’m interested in this committee because i’m interested in having a say on this committee. i’m a freshman and i’m unfamiliar with the system and how people interact with it, and that might be useful.
	•	Alex: i’m a senior caucus whip, i’ve been on ASG 
	•	eric: what is your availability monday and tuesday eve?
	•	Alex: monday i’m free before 8, tuesday before 8
	•	Bella: What do you see the Chief of Staff’s role being? 
	•	Robin: My only interaction was his role in getting people involved. It’s a very important decision and affects everyone in ASG and around campus. I think we need to consider who occupies that role. 
	•	Alex: I worked closely with David when he was CoS and he made his priorities clear. I believe I have gotten a good idea from Rafael’s exec reports what the general gist of his role is. The CoS needs to identify gaps and fill them. It is not just about recruitment, but also retention and that ASG works well as a team. 
	•	Isaac: Motion to end questions. 
	•	Noah: No objections, then we move to debate. 
	•	Isaac: Motion to white ballot. 
	•	Noah: No objections we’ll move to a vote. Congratulations. 
	•	Old Business: SL1415-02 Student Leadership Stipend Committee
	•	Erik: Hi everyone. Just to reiterate this is the creation of the committee that will create and execute the Student Leadership Stipend Program. Basically, I would be heading the committee and select the committee. The committee will be shaping the application, mainly the merits based portion. The committee will not be looking at the financial side. They will also determine how we will advertise the program and reach students, especially low income students. 
	•	Alex: How many members are you planning to select? 
	•	Erik: 6-10
	•	Lauren: Will the committee only be around for one cycle? 
	•	Erik: Yes.
	•	Grace: Since you are only doing the merit part, is everyone who passes the financial part equal? 
	•	Erik: The student run committee will be blind to the financial side, so they won’t have the final say. We will probably have a ranked list and then finances would be considered. 
	•	Vicky: How do you plan on selecting this committee? 
	•	Erik: I’ve reached out to groups like NCDC, GES, Wildcat Welcome, etc. I want to reach out to a diverse group of people and anyone can be on the committee. If people are interested, feel free to reach out to me. 
	•	Vicky: Did you reach out to the groups as groups or to individuals? 
	•	Erik: I reached out to them as individuals. 
	•	Noah: We are moving into debate and are in line for a con. 
	•	Vicky: Erik, I love you and I trust you to pick great people. But I think you perspective is limited to the people you know and are aware of. I think there should be an open application that is open to the entire committee. In addition to that, I think whoever you do select should be approved by Senate. 
	•	Vicky: I motion to add that “there will be an open application for those wishing to apply to the committee and the committee will be approved by Senate.”
	•	Noah: We are now in debate and are open to cons. 
	•	Alex: I discussed this with my caucus and I was initially going to propose this. Because this is so short term and thinking of how pressing this is, I think it is the role of the EVP. The students expressed their trust in Erik when they elected him and it was in their platform. 
	•	Lauren: Erik how much longer do you think it would take? 
	•	Erik: Considering the fact we still need to put together the PR, we are already pushing back reviewing applications to Thanksgiving break. My deadline for confirming this committee was going to be next Wednesday. 
	•	Ronak: Given that a lot of student groups elect their student groups in the Spring is there a reason this needs to happen early in fall? 
	•	Erik: Part of the reason to do it in the fall is because it is easier for financial aid to provide info in the fall. The earlier students can know about it the better. It’s not so much the distribution of the stipend, but the committee’s ability to review applications. 
	•	Lauren: Motion to previous question. 
	•	Noah: Any objections? Okay we move to a vote. 
	•	Alex: Division
	•	Aye: 9, Nay: 20, Abstained 6. 
	•	Motion to previous question. Second. 
	•	Noah: Now we will vote as a whole. It passed unanimously. 
	•	Good of the Order & Announcements

WM: my name is Will I am a junior in Weinberg studying economics I believe I I am receptive to and aware of the needs and wants of nu students, pres of ISBE, fraternity, volunteer, why now? Why the ASG committee? What appeals to me is the public nature, it is the transparent side of ASG, they make the school better to me, ISBE makes me the ideal candidate, representing the needs of students, business edu. That work also involves constantly working with committee and with groups and reviewing and approving ideas we just accepted 150 members which is a bit more than ASG but it speaks to the need at NU that speaks to experiential learning.
KG: my name is Karan, I am a junior in Weinberg studying econ and math, my first time in America was my freshman year, pres of dorm, pres of RHA, VP of ISEC that facilitates ISEC, S. Asian dance, frat, I have been a part of a lot of student groups and I have interacted with a lot of leaders, I genuinely vcare a lot about this community I promised myself that I wold leave it better than when I joined it, the ASG 10k initiative is the greatest group because we are making a tangible difference. Taks interested and result oriented and not scared to go to students leaders and admin to get a better idea of how we can make a difference.
GK: my name is Anne Li, freshman in Medil, I initially didn’t apply to ASG bc I had no intention of joining, I adored my student govt in high school I was community service share pres of school for a year I thought in college I should focus more on my GPA but then I met someone in ASG who gushes about all the stuff you guys do and he seems really productive and I missed being productive and passionate and an important member of the community and this email came around and it was perfect because in high school I never purchased anything that we really needed, so I am really excited for the opportunity to hopefully fulfill my dream. I hope to listen to the NU community and give back.
GK: (via video)Weinberg Junior, MMSS, econ, consentration in music and finance, heard about it from last years 5k, thought it was fantastic open forum to democraticly chose an idea, numerous students who can use wifi on lakefill. Not having been a member of ASG, unique perspective. Lend, analytical approach to problem solving, thinking practically, reach pragmatic solutions, undergrad budget priority, similar process to 10k solicit ideas, research w budget constraints, craft viable proposals for budgeting community, appreciate the opportunity, informed prospective, unique perspective, asset, greatly appreciate your endorsement,
KM: poli sci freshman, not in ASG, really passionate about community, I feel that my experience in and out of high school have prepared me for a committee position, as class treasurer I had to help finance for prom and class trip and help determine what students want vs what we could afford, many students came up with ideas similar to the 10 k. I have experience dealing with these issues and working with admin on projects and big evernts, when I was organizing a local benefit consert I had to meet with the mayor and I had to work to install a recycling bin and had to work with admin to make it work. Competent at presenting to a large group of people, for a benefit fundraiser and I had to speak in front of a hundrer people down to earth and straightforward.
AM: freshman wienberg, undecided but probably econ, I am not involved in student groups but ASG was something I knew I wanted, I ran for senator and lost, why I want to be in the 10k is because I think it is a great opportunity it is rare tha students can be the change and it is something I want to be a part of. Why I am the best option: a lot of openmindedness and realistic, this committee requires speaking in front of groups of people and in high school I would talk about why not to do drugs, I was in leadership positions in high school. Thanks
RT: junior in Weinberg pre med bio, I love NU, but especially the people, wasn’t sociable pre NU, its impossible to to love every conversation you have with everyone from cartoons to sustainable development in foreign country’s, has led me to challenege myself to meet as many people as possible. I have hung out with NCSA CRU, fraternity, central marro, a part of NCDC, PAA, I will go to random meetings because I want to see people that I have not had the chance to meet, 10k includes the whole student body, wifi gets people out of their dorm, so as part of the committee I hope that I can enhance the experience, helping people meet eachother, or making people feel safe, you are all awesome and everyone has something to grant the community.
·      Amalia: its hard to narrow down topics, you work a lot with admin to figure out whats feasible, can you describe your experience working with admin
o   WM: as part f ISE we have a board of directors, one example is that ISBE is conducting a finance check to NY we worked with Weinberg dean of mentoring, constant meetings, it was something that came naturally, SOFO,
o   K: the president of RHA, gave me the chance to interact with a lot of admin, apart from that, I have had to work with JPK, Burgie and TI, now being part of the student task force, amongst the students interviewing, had a lot of chances to interact with them they know me by name and having that on the committee will really be a plus.
o   Anne: in high school I was on student counsul and chief editor. Conflicting roles, a lot of experience dealing with school when a tornado ripped up our community I was able to contact people. Equaly as important is being able to speak to the lower members of the community, in high school I was friends with janitors and community
o   Kenny: benefit consert that I organized, eq in Japan, raise money, performers come to raise 1000 of dollars, presented to the mayor who helped get performers from NYC to come. She was as active as we were
o   AM: no experience here but a lot in high school, when I was president, I had to work with the admin every day especially during homecoming and for blood drives, student engagement committee, admin select students to strengthen the community and foster school spirit, I do have a lot of admin experience and I don’t think it would be difficult here
o   Poco: I was secretary for my frat this past year we moved to lingren and during that I had to work w Julie Patricia and Mark, I have dealt with them here. When I was doing an internship in Nicuragua, I had to work with them there and I would imagine working with them here is easier than there
·      What do your time commitments look like and how much time do you have?
o   K: 2 commitments, ISEC, those are the only ones I have as of now, I have always been very involved in a pretty strong way so I don’t think taking 5 to 8 hours a week would be too bad
o   Anne: 3 commitments, they don’t take too much time, I am the type to make time, I can just sacrifice sleep
o   Kenny: Im not time committed to any group on campus other than my work study which is 6 hours, some student groups I may plan to join are the jazz band or intramural
o   AM: im a freshman so I don’t have many thing, I am apprenticing a DJ from midnight to 1, I have no time commitments so I can put a lot of time into this
o   Paco: I am working with ESL, and NUCHR, my first meeting is today, I have a lot more time this quarter because I am done being a treasurer, I will be okay with the time for this committee, I will only sign up for things that I have time to do.
o   WM: my mom tells me that if you want to get something done give it to someone who is busy, my term as ISBE president is done in January, I am looking for a way to get more involved
·      Corey: what about your leadership ability and character will help you differentiate between short term and long term effect on community
o   Anne: when I was in high school, in student counsil we had to deal with a lot of ridiculous questions, its definitely hard to distinguish what is and isnt possible, I cant think of any examples now but its something I have been dealing with
o   Kenny: as treasurer, we had a lot of proposals about events or proects and the biggest one that came up was the lunch line because it was too crowded, we didn’t do it because we didn’t have the money, if here at NU I would have approved it because it is something that truly would benefit the community, it would really impact the majority of students,
o   AM: in high school some ways that I changed, when I was pres of my sophomore class the dance was taken from us, those are 2 events that are now a tradition. 10k is a lot of money and that can do a lot of good and I do believe we need to make a lasting change,
o   Paco: sustainability in various countries, the topic of what is durable and how easy it is to use and fix is very important to me, especially if it improves lives. I love that kind of thing because you can penny pinch, not only the end product but afterwards, that is something that I will always think about
o   Will: in econ you talk about return on investment, you cant assign a number to a campus improvement, there are a few ways that you can talk about a lasting impact based on my personal experience really makes me an informed decision maker, not only how does this effect me as a class of 2014 but all the future classes
o   Karan: sustainable growth, short and long term growth, when I was elected RHA, very few freshman and sophomores, one of my biggest goals was to get the name out and change cukture of hall govt. I think it is better known, sustainable investment, same with AISEC, being the VP of time management, sustainable growth, members helping in the future.
·      Ian: if you were selected, would you stay on the committee for the remainder
o   Kenny: no brainer, yes, I am really passionate about this, I feel like this is something that I am really passionate about
o   AM: I knew I wanted to be in ASG, if I don’t get on this one I would definitely look to stay involved
o   Paco: I love NU anything on the committee would be perfect, enhance and pass on what made me love this place
o   Will: yes, and I am a junior
o   Karan: yes and I am a junior, invest time I want to make a difference on NU, I would want to do it next year as well
o   Anne: yes, flexible way to branch out to other committees as well.
·      Motoki: experience with the arts:
o   AM: I am a pretty bad artist if that’s what you want, I am creative but I think that is part of it and I think I come up with good ideas that contribute to the 10k committee.
o   Paco: I am a photographer and violin, I work with the key club and we would do things like a talkent or art show in a hallway, but in general
o   William: instagram, in terms of the NU art community, my friend gave me a tour of the Block I have heard the NU Philharmonic in Pick and student art shows,
o   Karan: I have been dancing for 15 years, with respect to other art forms, the symphony I enjoy music
o   Anne: piano, I wish Allison had a piano because its nice when youre having an emotional day
o   Kenny: Im not artist im a music guy, electric guitar and I am going to audition this Saturday.
·      Rebecca: what would your submission be?
o   Paco: hammocks
o   Will: enclosure for bus stops
o   Karan: printers in dorms
o   Anne: pianos
o   Kenny: bikes for a day,
o   AM: laundry is terrible, updates laundry machines.
o    
o    
·      Leverage your ASG power
o   Sofia: More about guiding them toward progress and leading them to progress
o   Alex: I am a senator and on hall govt for publicity chair, social chair of foster, making poster, happiness club, listening to people, want a way for people to speak and for us to listen
o   Danial: audit events, on sustainability for a few weeks the student leaders have come and said there is no money to execute ideas, no idea how to get going, the outreach and connection I have
o   Gabi: on publicity, get people interested and to care about what were doing, trying to get people to understand and appreciate, someone who may not think about participating, the more people you reach the better the program
o   Evan: I am not on a committee now which allows me to focus my attention to this, I have sent emails around and branch out across the senate,
o   Morgan: kemper hall senator, not the most active of buildings, mostly upperclassmen, an under represented group in ASG, engineers don’t always thing ASG is their spot, hopefully will soon be active
·      Did you participate last year?
o   Alex: asked for the big parking lot to be turned into a park.
o   Danial: I voted
o   Gabi: bike lanes
o   Evan: in high school
o   Morgan: I didn’t submit an idea but I posted
o   Sofia: I voted but didn’t submit
·      I submitted a bunch, what is your top criteria?
o   Daniel: high buy in low upkeep, costs 10 k and then hopefully very low to keep going, create utility something that everyone can use.
o   Gabi: feasibility and applicability, this is something that anyone can use its everyone’s money
o   Evan: feasibility and long term impact, its getting ASG into the minds of the community, I want something to brag about back home, Im a freshman I want something that will last
o   Morgan: the people it impacts, if it is not a broad reaching impact its not worth it. Long term impact.
o   Sofia: growth and exposure, larger projects can be downsized and reevaluated, exposure, every student should have access to it and it should have some practical use
o   Alex: there is someone out there that is brilliant insightful with no power to solve problems on their own, and with the 10k we are thinking how did we survive before this and thinking “thank youASG!”
·      Mike: what methods would you use to better market for project proposals and voting
o   Gabi: marketing is my background, one of the most important things is going person to person, whether is a frat chapter or meetings and not giving a shpeil but going and really talking I think we can all agree that this is an amazingopportunity for everyont
o   Evan: starting a club taught me how to get interested. Kids like free food, the more people that hear know and will submit. I did P wild which gave me access to a really andom group of kids which would give me across the board impact
o   Morgan: munchies, every dorm has it at some point, if you go to different club meetings, write up your idea and come tell us.
o   Sofia: flyers are flyers and emails have an effect but not that long. Branching points to give them examples or idea, more feasible and it will make them feel like they have more ownership
o   Alex: happiness club, events are direct, I feel like that’s the kind of principle we should use when advertising for this, something that will really spur an individual interest is someone coming up to you with a notepad and writing down what they said
o   Daniel: everything that has been said is important the more you hear about something the more solidified it becomes but its more important to create an image with people in it already, Norris has pictures of people enjoying Norris. Its one thing for me to read ASG is doing something but its better to see a picture of my roommate.
·      Brad: if you were to get this would you stay involved
o   Evan: 4 years
o   Morgan: at least 2 years
o   Sofia: till I graduate
o   Alex: I would love to keep going as and engineer you want to keep bettering a project
o   Daniel: too cool to quit
o   Gabi: absolutely, I want to market things the rest of my life.

·      Coordinate effort for recruitment,
·      Cabinet selection committee.
o   Chaired by pres which selects PRVP TVP SVP, CRVP, adding to that, the COS will also be selected through that process, adds the sitting COS, to the selection committee, adding the speaker, response to all of you, a good compromise in that respect, clarifies that the outgoing member of the cabinet, references the outgoing so we are just making it explicate

o   Calendar listing and times of meetings and Events.
·      Ian: move to amend 70713, university res life should be University Residential Life.
·      David: Selection committee, the outgoing VP sits as non voting member, but my understanding is that they vote in the case of a tie
o   Brad: numbers no longer require them to vote
·      Sarah: adding speakers adds power to the senate
o   Brad: added them to the committee for the entire cabinate. When this committee decides, they don’t get to appoint, only to recommend
·      Alex: POI: are committee members allowed to abstain, because then there could be a tie.
o   Brandon: they can abstain,
·      David: motion to amend: I want to amend the code to not add the sitting chief of staff to the selection committee
o   I don’t think this is a good system to set up for an organization, I can attest that the fact that outgoing admin are cooperative for better or worse in terms of being helpful I think its irresponsible to have the potential for a senior to have substantial responsibility to on this committee. I don’t think there is any value in having the sitting chief of staff, it creates the potential for an unproductive situation.
o   CON Brad: I just spoke to david, if you want to present this amendment you should, whatever you want to do I am okay with it. I want to say why its in there now, they have a years worth of experience and they have that knowledge especially because they have an intimate relationship with all of these people, original they were a voting member but I agree giving that responsibility to someone who is checked out is scary but that’s the reason why they are in there to begin with.
·      Jesse: if the concern is that they will be checked out but they are not a voting member anyways, what is the reasoning for not allowing them, I don’t see the harm.
o   David: the onus is having them adding value rather than not detracting. I don’t think there is any value added in having the COS sitting there. What if this person is impossible to schedule around, are you in a situation to see if they need to be there. How would they add.
·      Rebecca CON: I think in certain admin, there could be that one person who is really valuable, there can be instances where they want to share their wisdom,
·      Ian: I think davids personal experience is irrelevant, additionally the assumption is that the COS is a senior, so the person who sits there as the person who understands the inside of the position, in choosing the chief of staff we will pick someone who will see their job through the end of the quarter
·      Motoki PRO: previously, we never had the outgoing admin VP to be in the committee, I don’t see a point that had someone selected through the old admin sit and help select the new one.
·      Brad: both the FVP and SGC are elected by outgoing, there are 3 instances in which the previous admin controls next one.
·      VOTE: all in favor of approving davids amendment to the amendment
o   Does not pass.
Motoki: motion to amend and not strike out the 5th line about the RHA RCB
·      PRO: Last year I was the RHA RB whip, ASG filled seats without RHA RCB knowing
·      Ian: If we strike that like, it violate the RHA constitution
·      Ani: the reason I crossed out 5…
·      Motoki: motion withdrawn
Amanda: im confused about the COS
·      Ani: whats been presented as the proposed COS is amendable, we still havnt voted on the COS, so we can amend it
·      Brad: right now were only debating the amendments to the bill, but it wouldn’t approve the legislation.
Ian: RHA RCB have in place procedures if a place goes absent, we have our own process to replace it. If were negligent then the responsibility should shift to ASG because we have proven ourselves irresponsible
·      Brad: so a group cant hold our seat hostage and not give us someone, it’s a worst case scenario.
Sarah: I motion to amend the amendment, I think it should be moved to 4 weeks, only because of the way PHA IFC is set up.
·      Brad: Point of information, what your proposing is an amendment to our current code, the number 3 isnt an amendment, you can still make the amendment
o   Ani: we work with the organization and if the group is making good faith then we wont
·      Sarah: withdrawn,
·      Previous Question
·      PQ
Brad: motion to table the bill on week
·      We amended the bill there is a constitutional amendment coming up, there is a constitutional amendment coming. We want to vote on this at the same time so that our code doesn’t conflict with the constitution.
Brad: this bill is the senate group apportionment, what this does is move the process from the beginning of this quarter to next quarter as well as adds the COS. It’s a little simpler, the EVP is currently the chair of the committee, we added the COS but the EVP would still sit on it. Its also changing that the COS was only voting in cases of a tie, now they are going to be a non voting member of the committee, there is no way the group could tie so the COS doesn’t need to vote.
·      Ian: point of privilege, abstentions exist, so a tie is conceivable.
*Ani: Gabi and Evan are the members of the new committee
·      PQ: passed,
Brad: motion to table
·      Passed
Steven: just a little background, last city counsel meeting, the rental unit licensing ordinance came in from of city consul, there was a mob of land lords, they were booing hissing, it was hysterical and immature, they were all over 30 maybe 40. Lets have a resolution that its not just me supporting this, we were there for much of the meeting but I was the only student that came and spoke. Its unlikely that we will have students show up next Monday. Landlords were saying they didn’t leave their houses dangerous, when we all know. I don’t think that’s acceptable for any housing. This would validate every conversation that I have had. This will give them the regulatory “brothel law” they will be able to have steep fines if landlords refuse to have inspection officers in. its ultimately on the landlords shoulders to communicate that that is happening. Steep fines that don’t license or follow the laws. To my knowledge there is no way for the city to evict people, a compliance schedule will be set up. I think this is really important and I would mention I would suggets to move this to old business.
·      Ian: will fines increase my rent
·      Steven: 25 dollars added over 12 months. Considering how much it costs to live off campus this is not a significant increase. I personally think that that is extremely worth it.
·      Brad: why do you want it to be old business
·      Steven: next Monday it is coming up at city hall, if we don’t pass it now it wont have a strong effect, I cant tell you what will happen next Monday. As far as I know there is only one alderwoman who is considering not supporting it
Corey: motion to move this to old business
·      Jesse:
·      Steven: my former landlord was at the meeting, I spoke to him, there were 4 other people there, which was illegal. This will allow the city to look on an objective basis how many people are actually allowed to live in the location.
Michele: can we read this?
·      Steven: yeah ill send that to Ani to send it to you but it may not be the most recent version
·      The one concern is that what if this passes but they don’t change occupancy, that would mean they are all lying, one they don’t want that, there is an election in the spring. People should vote in the local election. You can register to vote in Evanston after you vote for the president. This problem hasn’t gone anywhere in 2 years since that big thing happened.
Ian: motion to move this to old business
·      PASSED
Steven: I have seen the draft to change the occupancy code, they changed the cap from 3 to 6 but its 6 per rental unit, that applies to all general housing district. And further, the majority if not all of the houses are segmented into multiple flats so there are two or three different units. I would estimate that 90 to 95% of housing would be legal under the new change.
Ian: motion to PQ
·      PASSED UNANIMOUSLY
Motoki: hey guys, SGC, we have seen in the past few years is that we have a lot of new student groups come wanting recognition. We would be putting a new sub committee that would go behind forming a new student group. We spend a lot of time doing hearings, and groups come unprepared.
·      Michele: students selected by the SGVP, so the 14 voting members, the members of the new group will be selected in a similar fashion. Motoki: the sub group that Lauren manages,
·      Ani: SGC has their members confirmed by senate because they are in charge of allocating, they wouldn’t come close to funding, that’s why Rules allowed this. So that why Rules doesn’t require these new members to be confirmed.
·      X: how many people would be in this group
o   Motoki: 2, that could change.
Motion to old business. Seconded.
Ian: Motion to amend,
·      PRO: even though these people aren’t dealing with funding directly I do feel that they should go through the same scrutiny
·      CON Rebecca: they don’t touch anything
·      David: this is an unnecessary bureaucratic process.
·      Motoki: the groups handled on these will have to go through a recognition hearing by the committee that is approved
·      Brad: whether or not you pass it, I would ask that if you want to amend it, you should wait until next week to vote on it when Lauren is here
·      Ani: don’t like it when we rush bills through, there is a reason why
Ian: I withdraw my motion, motion to table. Second
·      Passed.
CONSTITUTIONAL FORUM on CHIEF of STAFF LEGISLATION.
·      The first paragraph – changed spelling of Greek councils
·      Clerk is being struck
·      EVP as director of the cabinet is struck for duplicity
·      EVP as director of the Operations Committee is also struck
o   EVP is allowed to delegate responsibilities – can legally delegate Operations Committee chairing to Chief of Staff
·      Chief of Staff is added to the Cabinet
Brad: you have had a week to deliberate,
Katie: respectfully disagree with Jesse, I don’t think we can say nobody cares
CON: David, I think a lot of people care and I think most of those people in this room. This has been in front of senate since the first day, this has been a piece of legislation that has been debated for 3 years, it is a public forum. This is one of the more public forums we have held, we held one online via facebook I really don’t think the argument that this is setting a bad president this I don’t think it’s a good one.
·      Delaying this another week just because of principle is denying the fact that we need to move on.
PRO: I don’t think that saying in previous attempt to change is better is a good argument for saying that this is what we should be doing. I don’t think this is what the writers of the constitution intended. I think we are trying to rush something through that out to be given more gravity
·      Mike: I think because a forum wasn’t stuck to we shouldn’t move this.
CON: Jesse: does anyone believe that if we moved this back a full week, it would change the constitution. Were not sneaking one by, were doing exactly what the precedent told us to do
·      Brad: I want to echo that, we are doing exactly what is proscribed in the constitution, you all have known that this was going to be in here, you have had time, you will have a 2 week period to speak to them. Everyone received this information. It’s a completely internal matter
·      Motion to PQ.
·      All in favor of striking the public forum: does not pass.
Motion extend senate indefinitely: passed.
Parliamentary Body Restructuring
Special order FORUM



Northwestern University
Associated Student Government
Meeting of the Senate
October, 22, 2014

	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	General Order: Student Group Spotlight-Northwestern Community Development Corps
	•	Taylor: Thank you so much for having me. NCDC is a student organization that strives to build community between NU, Evanston and CHicago. We manage a lot of volunteer sites, hold speakers, and put on special events. We used to have advocacy that came out of the Living Wage Campaign, which was a success. Since then advocacy was in flux, so we saw that NCDC didn’t focus enough on Northwestern. Now we have an outreach program, which aims to increase collaboration on campus. One problem NU has is overprogramming and we have started addressing that within the social justice groups on campus to get them talking to each other. We want to reduce programming, but increase effectiveness. We are really focusing on getting student leaders on campus to collaborate. NCDC is very excited to partner with anyone, so please reach out to us if you have any ideas or questions. 
	•	Sam: What are you most excited for this year? 
	•	Taylor: I am most excited for - we had our kick-off, which was exciting. I’m excited for student leaders to get into the same room. It doesn’t have to be a formal email process. And I’m also excited to see engagement to become more important on campus. 
	•	Moira: What are you doing with the Social Justice groups? 
	•	Taylor: We compiled a list of those leaders and emailed all of them to ask them to hang out with them. We chose them first, because we have the most connections there. 
	•	Bella: What are some upcoming events? 
	•	Taylor: We just reviewed our feedback and it looked like people want a calendar and a facebook group to talk about things. We need to look at what is most effective. My vision is kind of a matchmaking process to get people to collaborate on similar ideas from different angles. 
	•	Sam: What do you recommend we do to help? 
	•	Taylor: Yeah, not be afraid to reflect on overprogramming and to talk about it. What NCDC does does not necessarily define how successful we are, we also have to look at the intangible. 
	•	Isaac: Do you think our funding process contributes to overprogramming? 
	•	Taylor: Yeah it really does. We were having trouble finding a speaker and didn’t want to put on a bad one, but we were worried about getting a financial misconduct. 
	•	General Order:  ASG Recognition for Student Groups
	•	Alex: We’ve been talking about on SGC about how confusing the recognition process is. In previous years, CSI used to be underdeveloped and understaffed, but they have built up and can now do more. ASG created the recognition process because the administration was not doing it. But now CSI has the resources and structure to help. The current state is people might talk to Julia, or CSI, or eventually me and maybe Ariel - the definition of bureaucracy. First they would apply to T status and then eventually B status, which is where the money is. The issues are: bureaucracy, there is no single process for getting recognition, communication with CSI and ASG at the same time about the same thing, and ASG is not equipped to determine the ability of groups to exist on campus (legality, risk management, etc.)
	•	Ariel: The only difference between CSI and ASG right now is that we provide funding. 
	•	Basically what we have done is combine our recognition process with CSI. First students would talk to CSI and they would be recognized, and if they needed funding, then they would come to ASG. 
	•	Alex: Based on their funding needs, they might be sent to a department instead of ASG if it makes more sense. 
	•	Ariel: Current T status will not be affected by this change, it will change for currently unrecognized groups. 
	•	Alex: For CSI recognition, groups do not need to put on programming before they can be recognized. Someone with a great idea can get their group set up with CSI and then move on. They will have the ability to book rooms, have an advisor, etc. but would not have to meet with their GE and what not. We are still going to have students involved in the process, though. 
	•	Isaac: Are there groups that are recognized other than ASG and CSI? 
	•	Alex: Yes
	•	Isaac: Do we want all groups to go through CSI? 
	•	Natalie: Up until two years ago, we didn’t even have a process of registering all student groups. We are working closely at CSI with other departments to facilitate the process. We are having that conversation, but it might take longer with some offices. 
	•	Isaac: How does the approval process for changing this work? 
	•	Alex: Right now what we approved as a committee is our practice, but we will have to have it approved by Senate to be a code change. 
	•	Alex: Functionally, you said t status groups are grandfathered in. How long will that last? 
	•	Ariel: T-status only lasts one year. 
	•	Alex: What will be different for those groups than for CSI groups? 
	•	Alex: They will have a GE, but nothing else.
	•	Chris: If someone asks me how to start a student group, who do I refer them to now? 
	•	Natalie: We have a handy dandy form! It’s an initial questionnaire. We want to cut down on overlap and streamline the process, because we don’t want seventeen groups with two members.  
	•	Ariel: ASG will still be involved. 
	•	Alex: So the initial link will be that form, which we will have on the ASG website. 
	•	General Order: PR for Wild Ideas 
	•	Noah: I want everyone to come get a few flyers and put them around. Don’t break any NU rules, that would be TOO WILD *pause for laughter*. There is also a cover photo that will be circulated, so please change your picture. 
	•	Good of the Order & Announcements
	•	Roll Call and Adjournment
ASG Senate Minutes
10-24-2012

Brad: CSI has requested 1000 from the senate Project pool for a NU day at United. Im wondering if that was brought forth in legislation how many people would be interested
	(little support)
Haley: a little about the diversity comittee, we have been working on the academic requirement we have been working with the directpr for campus involvement and inclusion we have also set aside our fall quarter inititives. we will be working on getting a prayer room, gender neutral bathrooms, reaching out to people in the chabad house and making sure the students have the right connections. Diversity requirement is our year long initiative, 
	Brock: what is the requirement, 
Haley: something that was brought on by students, it would be a requirement in weinberg that students would have to take something that would cover diversity, it would be a course that would occur during freshman year and it would teach them how to discuss this as well. The curriculum belongs to the faculty, right now it seems like it would be one course but a distro requirement is possible to. after the report they will know better. I have no preference
Marc: read the report, it has the format for my committee, if you have any questions please e-mail me. 
David: hopefully you guys went to the foodtruck festival, Homecoming did most of the work for us we are looking to do it once a quarter but maybe once a month.

Ani: please return the clickers, they were ordered years ago, there might be a project pool request asking for clickers. Shout out to Lauren who brought my hammer back, I feel like Thor getting his hammer back but less chiseled. 
	Brandon: Code review, rules committee conducted code review brad and victor helped a lot. it is when rules looks at the code, it is basically trying to keep the code within our practices, it is not meant for major changes its mostly for little changes, we are going to give you a week to look at it and we are going to vote on it next week. 
	Ani: well post the link to the adgenda. 
Victor: as mentioned last week we pasted legislation last quarter to give you guys updates to make sure we were doing our jobs. we all put together platforms that outline our goal and our vision.

	Brad: these were things not included in our platform, 10k initiative, 
Victor: Board of Trustees engagement, connecting students to them and they are very powerful and passionate and this is working with the admin to do so one is having round table and reception style. this would be an invite only event. TV interviews with them, how they got to how they are now.

	Brad: plenty of opportunity for student input, it will definately be contraversial 
	Ian: in terms of adding the fee,

Neil: hey guys, so I am just going to talk about my projects, there is also a list of who is workin gon them in the report. Accounting courses, the issue is 2 fold, the expansion of the existing course BIP 260, it really fills up we are trying ot work with UVPC, higher level accounting courses, admin doesnt want Weinberg to get to professional.

	Ian: you describe students who are in music have problems taking classes how has that been addressed
	Neil: I guess it hasnt been addressed, its hard to work on right now
	Ian: how are you going to connect with other schools than kellog, the grad school. 
	Neil: after I speak with administrators and come up with a plan, i will open it up to committee members. 
Alex: Attendence Incentives for Athletic events, nothing came of it, athletics just wanted to handle it on their own. Flexible upperclassman meal plans, were working with CASE (consultants advising student enterprises) they are handleing that and working with sodexo, lightwalk, completed by jane gilmore, NU tradition book, the NU class alliance, were waiting on them. if you want to help out with that. electronic IM sign ups, that will be done by the end of the quarter. New Student Center. they are surrently working on something that will be done in december. Upperclassmen housing, working on master plan JPK, Brad Victor and I met with consultants, there will be more of that to come. Performance spaces, some res halls dont have pianos, alumni resource consolidation, something with UCS, consolidate those make it easier for students to access. Weekend Dininghall, looking whether or not HInamn is the best place. transportation improvement, katie was a part of it. if you are interested let me know, I will be updating you on a weekly basis, the thing with studentlife, its hard to give a timeline but ill be updating you with progress. Chicago engagement fair, i have worked with ROb Donahugh, one book one NU, i am on the steering committe, a way to create option for studens to get an experience. Extending Library hours, mudd will be 24 hours for finals. field use and renevation. Long field, maybe turf?/ Multipurpose 24 hour spaces, we brainstormed some ideas where we could keep open 24 hours. what would be the most feasable what they could do with a roll out pilot program this winter. Police Protest responce code reform, ad hoc committee for america. 
	Steven: had to do with what heppened last year how police respond to that. in case something were ever to happen and there was a peacful protest, students wouldnt be harmed nor their rights jeopordized. we havent had any meetings this year but there are some scheduled. 
Alex: moving along, satelite recreational facilities, its only 10 min to spac but it seems like forever in the winter, were looking at the options talking to student affairs. Student group library printing, if you havnt noticed they have a new system you can print from anywhere in campus, rolling out more optons. Student group library printing, linkng up ASG system to the library, they said it was feasable, they are working out the kinks, should have progress soon. Elevators in res halls, they are open year round, the ones that arent maintenence. electronic package notifications, those rolled out with a piolote program in the spring and is now launched full on. let me know if thats not happening. if you have any problems. Archive digitization, I have a huge file that i think it would be cool for people to have online i know PLI will be helping ius I know it will be digitized by the end of winter if not sooner. if you want to see past diversity intiatives if you want to see past the 80s. how student life is applicable for upperclassman, using firesides as an outreach so its not just here but taking it to the halls, senators well use as a tool for that. Hannah and Jane are working on blue light stuff on campus making sure they can be reached. Cleaning Staff Days, looking at the contract and see if there is a way we can arrange it to see if there is a day that things can get cleaned over the weekend.(Marc, Cleaning Staff appreciation day?) Lock out policy that was something i heard a lot of push back about, they rolled out this year, they charge you the 3rd time and charge you and change your lock, people are mad and it needs to be addressed. that should be something that should be done by the end of the quarter. to go with the U-pass debate there are far more options for going into the city. a pass you can get you can load money onto online, its a shorter term solution. email me, my emai and phone number is in the exec board report i know stuednt life stiff is really broad. let me know if there is something you want to work on. 
Ani: a follow up to that, these will be online, we want to bring forward everything that were working on they will come before they start puting resources and time into it. as we have seen over the past few weeks, senate’s insight is imperative. 
Victor: These amendments and code changes reflected everything needed to add the position. This is the culmination of about three years of work - the Chief of Staff is really an organizational necessity to streamline recruitment efforts and so that human resources aren’t a scatterbrained effort year in and year out. We want to make sure that everyone feels they are part of a community and has the tools to succeed. 
	Over the past couple of weeks we’ve reached out to a lot of you guys about concerns and thoughts:
	- We see the clerk as an outdated position, especially in a large exec board. Taking notes isn’t really a great role for an exec board member
	- In terms of responsibilities, the CoS is very different from the EVP - the EVP is more about meeting and managing members of the exec board, whereas the CoS would be more about retention and development of senators and committee members
	- In terms of Senate’s power, you are in charge of confirming exec members, and for a position of this caliber, just like other exec positions, it is important to open this up to the rest of campus
	- However, for right now, we feel that Carly is the best for this position
	Carly: First we want to apologize to anyone who felt disrespected by the last few Senates. I want to talk about two things - why the Clerk should be dissolved, and the distinction between Clerk and CoS. After spending time as the Clerk, there aren’t enough responsibilities to warrant being on exec. Think about what you’re (Senate) losing by dissolving this position. Ani’s job as Speaker is to represent Senate on the exec board and the Clerk isn’t really doing it. Also there aren’t other organizations that have Clerk-related positions. For two years, the elections for Clerk have been unopposed, and there isn’t much excitement about it. 
	Also, there is value in keeping the exec board small, in terms of cohesion and effectiveness, which is why dissolving the Clerk and creating the CoS came up at the same time. This issue isn’t new - it was brought up three years ago and has been seen as a problem by many different administrations, and Brad and Victor are the first ones to act on it. 
	Ani and Brad have been given many additional responsibilities regarding recruitment that have added a lot of strain on top of their original jobs, and adding a CoS would add a level of professionalism to the organization. The level of success of this organization with a CoS will really go forward, and you will be able to leave this organization feeling like you’ve accomplished much more. 
	For these reasons I really think the legislation should go through as it is. 
	Motoki: Could it be the job description of the Clerk... (?) Could it be that adding the note-taking to the Parliamentarian will detract from his other responsibilities?
	Brandon: No, when we change note-taking to a way more consistent with Robert’s Rules, which is more of a summary of points and noting the motions, as opposed to how it is now. 
	Victor: After changing the notes to a condensed version, I don’t see it being a problem.
	Ian: It could help parliamentary procedure when we change the structure of note-taking.
	Henry: Regarding recruitment, how the CoS will help with recruitment on a week-to-week basis - what recruitment happens on a week-to-week basis?
	Ani: There is constant turnover in this organization.
	Brandon: [agreed]
	Oregano girl: Why don’t we want this position elected from the Senate?
	Brad: The CoS coordinates very much with the Parliamentary Body without taking away the body’s power to appoint senators. Week-to-week recruitment is not as prominent within committees but it is still important, especially since committees like the SAFC and 10K recruit on different timelines. 
Ani: Seeing none we will move into debate period.
Brad: Motion to amend on behalf of Sarah Brock, who cannot be here tonight. [Motoki: amend] I definitely support the amendment as well, but I want to be clear that I did not write it. This is going to come in the legislation right after the word “required.” You guys can all read that on the board.
Everyone: [reads]
Henry: [something about Clerk and CoS]
Brad: The elimination of the Clerk is vital to the creation of the CoS.
Ani: Mark had a question - “What does this all mean?”
Mark: I’m not sure in what part of the description he or she has some sort of special	responsibility.
Brad: Comfort of senators, exec board, etc. is very much integral to what the CoS does. As we improve our own internal accountability, that transfers down to students who see better results. 
Ani: Other questions?
David: I motion to PQ. [second] [yes] [it happened]
Ani: Abstaining?
Jesse: No sorry that was something else.
[laughs]
Ani: A simple no would have sufficed.
Jesse: What?
Ani: Nothing I was just being an asshole.
Henry: Main thing I have a problem with is taking away a role from the Parliamentary Body, we could potentially have a Clerk who really represents the Senate on exec.
Ani: We’re now in line for a pro speech.
David: Can I just address that argument? I’ve only been a part of two exec boards, but I really disagree that the Clerk even has the opportunity to provide that voice because she doesn’t have room to do that and her role is not defined that way. That this has been brought up for three years shows that it’s not an issue of who specifically is on the executive board. I truly believe that this is much bigger than the fourteen of us and more about the way our organization is structured. 
Ani: We’re now in line for con speech.
Ian: I move the PQ on this amendment.
Ani: This requires 2/3rd of Senate to approve.
Multiple people: Second.
Ian: I move for a standing vote.
David: Ooh, dramatic!
Motoki: I move for a ballot vote.
Various: [no] [object] [are you serious] [that is the worst idea]
Steven: I love voting about voting!
Ani: We are voting to change the constitution. 
Ian: Point of parliamentary order - [something]
All in favor: 31
All against: Francis 
All abstaining: 3
^Carly’s last notes!!!!
 
Code review:
Ian: motion to PQ
(passed)
Ani: student group apportionment, moves the process to fall quarter. they find out if they have a senate seat and then apply to be senator rather than the other way around. 
Ian: Motion to strike “though shall not vote unless in the case of a tie”  abstiaing members do not count to vote totals, if there is no previsions for a tie everything breaks downs and I hear the code bursts into flamrs. 
	Girish: there are frequently people who cant make it to all the meetings
	Brad: stike as a non voting member
	Ian: okay
(passed)
Ani: All in favor of adjusting the code as written please say Aye 
(passed)
Lauren: you guys struck it last week, there was some discussion, a new student groups sub committee. there are a huge number of new student groups, its a problem because I dont have enough resources on my committee, I would like to solve that. when we focus on these new groups it pulls resources from the groups that already have status. Create a committee that focuses on the new groups specifically. 
	Ian: would the poeple on this new student groups committee have a say on who gets status. 
	Lauren: now these people work with people up until the point where they get recognition. they can consult but they would not be able to vote, they could bring them up or say youre not a good fit
	X: do you see this committee coming from withing, if the answer to this is yes, how does this help?
	Lauren: no, these people need to have different knowledge they would be trained seperatly
	Mike: what process would the new groups have to go through to be a part of this sub committee. 
	Lauren: no i usually just get emails once or twice a week, and i can just reference them to help you 
	Ian: how will you train then?
	Lauren: i have all the knowledge, so i am going to train and after the term and when i am ready to leave there will be a transition doc
	Mike: do you think 2 is enough?
	Lauren: yes, i think 2 is enough. 
Ani: in line for a con speech 
Ian: PQ
(passed)

Mike: Hi guys! I am a new office campus senator, 
Chirs: Im from elder
Mike: new grant called the service and community engagement grant, here at Nu individuals dont have access to funding for community relations, the idea is to create a grant of 500 that will provide student groups and individuals. selection committee has 3 asg students a vp of off campus, winter quarter selection for applications process. divided up 500 dollars, individual approved for the grant will have all of spring quarter to complete the project. 
Mark: why 500 dollars? 
Mike: its a pilot year: its like the .5k community service project. 
Nolan: how will you gage success?
Chris: okay um we put it into the bill that next spring senate will discuss it. whether its an individual or a group will have to complete a survey of whether or not they thought it was successful. 
Mark: if you take 500$ from ASG, why not take money from outside sources, sponsorship, ways to make the event a little impactful. 
Mike: Network. in terms to finding external grants. 
Chris: we have not looked at outside funding. we want to expedite this process. 
Rebecca: what do you think this 500 will be spent on? because I can think of a whole bunch of service ideas that dont cost 500$. 
Chris: flower boxes, anything that will impact how Evanston thinks about NU. 
Rebecca: what is the difference between this and NU gives back?
Steven: the difference is that NU Gives Back is a service day. this is supposed to empower student groups that maybe dont have the resources right now. I guess thats something that is up for debate. we would like to give people the opportunity to expand and be creative its why we want someone 
X: what happens if you select the group and they dont follow through, 
Chris: the be it enacted section, the section says it will get rolled back into the funds. this bill comes with some risk, we feel that this is not something we can avoid. 
Petros: concerning the timeline, reading week of spring quarter, what prevents people from saying they dont have time to fill out the form. 
Mike: even if they cant attend, if there are enough students, they have to come in and show all of their photos. 
Ani: NU’s climate commitment 
Mark: excessive detail is in the legislation. In the legislation is the climate ocmmittment, we now have the capacity to do this. 
Alex: for the top whereas on the second page... per person?
Mark: no youre right, good job
Brad: motion to add an agenda item, confirm Carly or else she wont be able to attend meeting on sunday

Carly: [Being Awesome] Confirmation speech
Motion to close question period [Accepted]
Endorsement/Debate Period
X: Carly is really hardworking, dedicated. Was instrumental in getting me involved in ASG, great for role.
X: Known Carly for a long time, was one of the most active individuals I’ve known, always trying to take on more responsibility. Transfers are great people in ASG- have more perspective
X: Carly has been positive force in ASG- gone above realm of responsibilities to work with operations, makes sure everything’s considered in all issues. Carly was an obvious pick for this position as the CoS responsibilities became more apparent. Has the talent to do well with the position.
X: CoS position came about before removal of the clerk- before the removal of the clerk was even considered, had planned to ask Carly to step down from Clerk and apply. Really thought Carly was the best person for the job
X: Question: Brad, did Carly help with your campaign
Brad: No, she was already Clerk and couldn’t do



Northwestern University
Associated Student Government
Meeting of the Senate
October, 29, 2014

	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	General Order: Assistant Dean of Students Tara Sullivan Presentation
	•	Tara: I could not be more excited to be with you today. I got my start in student government when I was an undergrad, so I thank you for all the hours you’ve put in. I came from Loyola in January and the Art Institute of Chicago before that. I did my undergrad at Indiana University and grad school at Michigan. We’ve been putting in a lot of work to change our conduct system and we have a new one right now. UHAS remains and is being reverted back to its original meaning. There is no longer SAHAS, all sexual assault hearings will go through UHAS as well. We want a process that students feel comfortable with and can understand. We are also looking for fairness, which doesn’t mean treating everyone the same, but that it is fair. We are looking for efficiency and timeliness, because we don’t want to drag out a conduct case over ten months. The new process has a focus on student rights and responsibilities, notifications, providing an individual experience and appropriate and consistent accountability. We find out about things from RAs, NUPD reports,  personal reports from faculty, staff and students, etc. In some cases there are interim actions, especially in title IX cases or something with more than one students involved. We might ask students to not contact each other, change class schedules, housing, etc. The process is really an opportunity to be heard and we have a few different options for that. Students have the opportunity to tell us their understanding of the events. Our standard of evidence has not changed, which is a preponderance of evidence standard. We are looking at what is more likely than not to have occurred. Northwestern has used this standard for a long time and are now mandated to use it for title IX cases, so we use it uniformly. We are not the legal system, I don’t have a JD, that is not the work that we do. We sit from an educational, developmental perspective. 
	•	Tara: We have two ways to be heard. The first is an administrative hearing, which is for situations that would not result in a separation from the university. If a separaton from the university is possible, students can choose if they want it heard administratively or if they want to have a panel hearing. Many people don’t want to have to justify themselves to five people and might prefer an administrative hearing. In cases with multiple community members, we automatically go to a panel hearing. 
	•	A hearing director receives information and might do an investigation, then present the student with the opportunity to be heard. We take into account students’ individual experiences, unlike a court. They will then find whether someone is responsible or not and then give sanctions. We have a basics program for anyone with an alcohol incidence, community service, etc. With an administrative hearing, students can request a review if they have not separated from the university. Students who have separated, can appeal. 
	•	For panel hearings, there will be an investigation that involves talking to witnesses, interviewing people involved,  etc. and making an official report. The report includes what they think happened, what they think didn’t happen, and where there is confusion. It is presented to students involved and the panel. Students meet with the panel separately from each other. The panel can ask questions of the investigator. 
	•	If someone is separated they can appeal. The criteria is: procedural error, new information, or case decision contrary to the evidence. 
	•	We want to have appropriate and consistent accountability, which means accountability fits the issue. Outcomes aren’t necessarily going to always be the same, but that it will be consistent. People learn and change their ways when the accountability fits their action. We don’t want people feeling like they are getting away with something or like they weren’t treated fairly. 
	•	Alex: What is the difference between exclusion and expulsion? 
	•	Tara: Exclusion means removal but that a reapplication would be considered. Expulsion means a permanent removal without ability to reapply. 
	•	Isaac: How has the student role changed? 
	•	Tara: Students serve on the panels for non title IX related concerns. We have also adjusted and upped our training. They will also be having quarterly training. We also look to a lot of feedback from students. Students have always served on our panels, but we want to use them more and increase their voice. 
	•	Kenny: The Responsible Action Protocol is a huge grey area. Could you clear up what “mitigated action” means? 
	•	Tara: The RAP is designed to ensure that someone who as a medical need can get that attention. Our first priority is getting students that medical attention if they need that. If you have been consuming alcohol or drugs and have a friend who needs medical attention, you call for help, stay with the student who needs help, and cooperate with the student and with questions after, then you are eligible. You will receive your letter and come chat with us, if you follow those, then you will not have disciplinary sanctions. You might have educational sanctions but not disciplinary. The same policy applies to sexual assaults. I think our students are highly skeptical of this policy. I don’t have control over our police system or EPD, NUPD is normally pretty aware and don’t cite students. But if the policy decide to cite someone for having a large amount of marijuana, that’s not connected to us. 
	•	Ronak: How would the hearing system look for student groups and greek life? 
	•	Tara: The process doesn’t change. 
	•	Daniel: I know students have been called in to discuss incidents where someone was at a greek house, then left, then was hospitalized. 
	•	Tara: Students that have provided alcohol need to be held accountable for providing that to minors. Our campus has a huge rumor mill. Normally a student group is held accountable if they are the main source of alcohol. We do a lot of investigating, we don’t just assume that an organization was primarily responsible. 
	•	Isaac: You say that with individuals and groups they are eligible for the protocol. What does that mean? 
	•	Tara: It applies every time if all steps are followed. But if you lie about something, then it is not necessarily applied. 
	•	General Order: Chief of Staff Confirmation: Andrew Green
	•	Rafael: If you could pull up the candidate info sheet. We have everyone from the selection committee up here and we are really excited to present Andrew to you all. He has a lot of experience reaching out to students at the beginning of their careers and later on. He has also been on an ASG committee since his freshman year. 
	•	Andrew: I think Rafael spoke well of me. I am interested in creating a stronger community within ASG and to improve the experience for members. I love ASG and it has been my longest commitment. And my initials are ASG! 
	•	Isaac: What do you think is the role of social events in ASG? 
	•	Andrew: That’s a good question. I think that there is some value in ASG events, but I don’t necessarily want to provide superfluous events to get people to hang out. In general, hopefully ASG is a place where people can form individual connections. I think through the existing connections is where people feel the most committed, so its most important to look there. 
	•	He is approved unanimously.
	•	General Order: Student Activities Finance Committee Confirmations
	•	Mckenzie: All Senators need to be on a committee and this is a great way to get involved. We work with all the A Status groups and meet Tuesday t 9. You need to be able to dedicate your time to this and give student groups your time. 
	•	Noah: We wll now open the floor for nominations. 
	•	Mckenzie: I would like to nominate Eric. 
	•	Eric: I accept. 
	•	Mcknezie: Sean Early. 
	•	Grace: I nominate Josh. 
	•	Josh: I do not accept. 
	•	Isaac: I nominate Jake. 
	•	Jake: I accept. 
	•	Serene: I nominate Naveen
	•	Naveen: I accept. 
	•	Daniel: I nominate myself. 
	•	Second. 
	•	Eric: I’m a sophomore representing district 1. I’m interested in SAFC, because I’m interested in Econ, finance and student groups. 
	•	Sean: This is going to be my third year and the board is really young, so I want to be able to pass down institutional information
	•	Jake: I’m a theater major and I am representing District 4. I am really active in student organizations and am beginning to understand how funding works. I think some groups get too much funding and I think I could fix that. 
	•	Naveen: I am a student group senator and I think that by getting involved in this, I want to increase co-spons and help student groups. 
	•	Daniel: I’m a sophomore and I would like to participate in this committee. I want to ensure that all groups have proper access for groups. 
	•	Ronak: What experience do you bring to the role?
	•	Sean: I have had the opportunity to advise many groups, so I think I serve the board well in that way. I have also served in the Wildcat Welcome Board of Directors and am part of A&O. 
	•	Jake: I recently joined Erik’s board to give out need based stipends to students and I am the only freshman on that committee. I’m here to learn and I think I can bring a fresh, traditionally dopey eyed outlook. 
	•	Naveen: I have had the opportunity to advocate for students through SASA. On the other side I can see how the funding system works and I am the kind of kid that likes to go to different events.
	•	Daniel: I’m a Counselor for FUP, I’m on the executive board of my fraternity, I do research, etc. I think I have a unique perspective that I could bring to this. I think being on this committee will give me the opportunity to enforce fairness. 
	•	Eric: I have experience from high school and I was selected by McKenzie already.
	•	Serene: What has been your favorite event on campus this quarter? 
	•	Jake: Wildcat Welcome as an entire program.
	•	Naveen: I think my favorite thing was the premiere of Rosewater. I liked seeing how two groups could work together to highlight an issue. 
	•	Daniel: I had a great time at Festivale. It was super fun and it was also a unique and enjoyable highlight of a culture. 
	•	Eric: I loved the College Feminists’ speaker. 
	•	Isaac: Do you see any issues with the funding process as it is? 
	•	Naveen: I think there are issues with all systems, but I think that the best way is to change the system slightly and not to quickly overhaul anything. Slow change is the best change. 
	•	Daniel: I’m not familiar enough to provide a real answer. 
	•	Eric: I don’t think I’m in the position to make a statement. 
	•	Jake: I don’t know about anything specifically. I just know that with the Stuco boards, many boards are choosing not to be A-status because they can make more money that way. I think that reveals a hole, because being A-status should be a goal. 
	•	Noah: The way this works now is we’re electing the non-senator seats. Anyone who has never been a senator is eligible to be nominated - they have to be in the room if they haven’t prepared a statement. 
	•	McKenzie: I nominate Justin, Jason, and David. 
	•	Noah: Are there any other nominations? Seeing none, we’re going to go into the question and answer period. 
	•	Justin: I joined SAFC in the spring, I’ve been through spring funding, I’m the only member who has a serious theater experience on the board, I think it’s really cool to help groups in spring funding and now I get to see the other side of it.
	•	Jason: I’ve been on the board for almost three years now, I’m the senior-most member of SAFC, I hope to continue working on the SAFC. 
	•	David: I’m a freshman, and I’d like to be on the SAFC because I believe that organizations are the cornerstone to the culture here and I’d like to participate in the financial aspect of helping run organizations and affect the culture here. 
	•	Motion to white ballot - no objections
	•	Motion passes
	•	Noah: Congratulations, you guys are confirmed. 
	•	Noah: Now we’re going to talk about PR for the environmental day of service. You’re about to get an email from me that we will ask you to share on your social media platforms. 
	•	General Order: PR for Environmental Day of Service
	•	Signups are open now and we are starting our PR. We are anticipating 100 people and have purchased materials for 100 people. Open up your email and look at the links. I put in a blurb also that you could post as a status or send over a listserv. Click on the facebook event and share it and write something about how great the Sustainability Committee it is. As members of ASG it would be great if you could sign up as well. It’s Saturday the 15th from 9am-12pm. If you are a residential senator, definitely send that over your listserv. It counts as green cup points! I also included the flyer in that email, so please include that as well. Sign up is live until November 1st. 
	•	The winners of the SAFC election are Eric, Sean and Daniel. 
	•	General Order: Wild Ideas Fund Request Slate
	•	$300 to APAC and Kaibigan for an event with an Asian, female rapper. The organization has gotten sources from elsewhere and only need $300 for the flight. The proposal was solid and look out for that event! 
	•	New Business: SL 1415-03 Bureaucracy Must Die
	•	Ariel: I am the Director for New Student Groups. The legislation is everything we presented last week - getting rid of T status and integrating the system with CSI. We are getting rid of all T-status mentions in the code and requiring groups to be CSI recognized for one quarter before applying for ASG recognition.
	•	ISaac: What is the role of students in the CSI recognition process?
	•	Ariel: The idea is that it will be a committee on which students will be involved, but it is not set yet. 
	•	Isaac: Can you bring that to senate when you do that? 
	•	Ariel: Yeah. 
	•	Old Business: SL 1415-04  Wild Ideas NAISA 150th Anniversary Commemoration of Sand Creek Massacre
	•	Erik: As Serene mentioned before, anything above $500 we have to bring to Senate. The Wild Ideas Committee thinks that this is a great use of the fund. November is Native American Heritage month and they want to put on an event for the 150th Anniversary of the Sand Creek Massacre. The event involves a speaker, a drum group and mocassin making. They have secured $500 from SESP and are asking ASG for $750. 
	•	Serene: This is new to Northwestern and this is the first time that Native American Heritage month is being celebrated on Northwestern’s campus to our knowledge. At the time being, NAISA does not have SAF funds. And SESP has put their whole weight behind this event. 
	•	Erik: NAISA has been recognized by the administration as the best new student group 2 years ago. 
	•	Daniel: Is this the first time that the administration has acknowledged the massacre?
	•	Serene: It’s not the first time it has been acknowledged, but NAISA has definitely started a dialogue recently. 
	•	Jonathan: How many members do they have? 
	•	Serene: I am not sure.
	•	Alex: Can you break down the costs of the drum group? 
	•	Erik: That’s an honorarium. 
	•	Alec: Is this how much money they asked for? 
	•	Serene: Yes. 
	•	Noah: We will now move into debate. 
	•	Isaac: Previous question? 
	•	Noah: Seeing no objections, we will move into a vote. 
	•	It passes unanimously.

	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	John C: Can substitutes come?
	•	Brandon: Nope

	•	General Order: Code Review
	•	Brandon: Mostly basic grammatical/formatting changes, but there were a lot of them. Changed to also reflect all the legislation that amends the code. Any questions?
	•	Ani: Moving to a vote on passing code review.
	•	Vote, approved unanimously

	•	General Order: Introduction to FUNding
	•	Ani: Computers are a privilege- pay attention! Take it away Girish.
	•	Girish: funding kicked off last night- want to give a quick explanation of the process.
	•	Everyone pays $54 a quarter into the ASG Activities fee- 97% apply for A-status funds, the rest is for B-status groups
	•	A-status groups fill out an application that lists past programming, request for the year and tiers.
	•	Tiers- different levels of funding that groups want to be funded at.
	•	There are applications, then interviews, then recommendations are made, and these recommendations are approved by Senate. You should talk to your constituents about the funding recommendations once they're released
	•	You can propose changes to recommendations through add & cut rounds. Can use the Senate Amendment pool ($13,171) to add funds, but remember that if the money is not used, the money will be added onto the next cycle- don't feel pressured to spend all of it.
	•	SAFC is bound by tiers groups give
	•	If event has not happened, will not fund until SAFC can review it
	•	Capital improvements not vital to programming funded in supplemental funding cycle
	•	SAFC does not fund new events or food.
	•	Questions?
	•	Girish: Mock Funding Session with Lauren!
	•	We're going to start with an Add round, where you'd be able to motion to add funds-
	•	ADD ROUND
	•	Lauren: motion to add funds to the T Swift dance party- want to fund it at a 30% increase, which is some amount that is reflective of a 30% increase… it's currently at 6%
	•	Lauren: we all love T Swift- great, wholesome music, and I know people feel the same way. There were 5, kidding, 100, no 150 people who came to our last event, and attendance this time will blow my mind- because there will be so many people who want to dance.
	•	SAFC Opinion (Tori): The T Swift Dance Party didn't... [moustache issues] while we realize attendance increased, the pool increased by 4% and we already gave a 6% increase and need to fund other groups, so can't fund that much.
	•	Ani: Any questions?
	•	Girish: We have to be conservative based on the size of the pool
	•	Ani: Other motions?
	•	Lauren: More money for our winter speaker- what happened last year is we brought people to campus to analyze T Swift's lyrics. It was successful, so we want it funded in full and we were close to discovering T Swift's last boyfriend she's never ever everrr getting back together with
	•	Ani: want to add anything else?
	•	Lauren: No. We think the last boyfriend was John Mayer. SAFC should come to the event and we did it without their money, so it'll be awesome.
	•	Tori: we typically don't fund new events, but we funded publicity and other event costs because we want to see the event happen consistently and maybe give funds in the future
	•	Girish: didn't show consistent funding
	•	Ani: Questions? Motions to add?
	•	Lauren: want to fund exec trip to concert in full
	•	Lauren: want to bring exec, emailed T Swift telling her we'd be coming, will be expecting us- very important for our group. Might get stuff from the concert and it'll help us put on awesome programming later
	•	Tori: we fund programming, not groups- we want all of the programs we fund to be open to all students. This event is not open.
	•	Girish: don't look at what a student group needs, just what they program. It's to benefit all the student swho put money into the pool
	•	Lauren: groups that are ASG recognized and accept funding for an event need to make sure the event is open to all of campus.
	•	Question: how does that work with equipment?
	•	Girish: happens in the supplementary funding cycle- capital improvements are covered then unless it's vital to programming happening before then.
	•	Girish: You have a right to change any of this if you don't agree with it
	•	Lauren: A lot of people are confused about funding, you need to be the voice to explain to constituents how funding works.
	•	Girish: recommendations will be out next Wednesday- look out for it.

	•	General Order: Director of Campus Safety Confirmation
	•	Alex: Been talking about things Student Life can do to increase legitimacy- looked at the code and figured out that Student Life can appoint executive officers. Want to appoint Jane Gilmore for director of Campus Safety because she led the light-walk which was very successful and something that she'll be working on in the future. The title will give her a little bit of extra push & authority
	•	Ani: Exec members can with 2/3 of senate vote appoint executive officers- can give larger sense of legitimacy.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Noah: New subcommittee out of this?
	•	Alex: No- just gives Jane a title with more authority
	•	Ani: If no further questions, we'll move into a confirmation speech
	•	Jane: I'm a junior in Weinberg on student groups caucus and on student life- should be finished with light-walk reports next week and will be working on blue-light changes- been working with administration on other safety issues
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian: How long do you see this position lasting?
	•	Alex: As long as Jane's on the committee
	•	Mark: Describe relationship with PTI
	•	Jane: Loves PTI… can't pronounce her name… she's awesome
	•	Ian: Do you see this being a position that Student Life should fill year after year
	•	Alex: Should be appointed on a case by case basis- something to keep in consideration, but may not be required every year.
	•	Ani: Any endorsements?
	•	Motion to previous question,  second, passed
	•	Vote on approving Jane
	•	Approved- unanimous vote

	•	General Order: Working Group on Alcohol Policy & Culture Recommendations
	•	Ani: look for link to this on your agenda, group was tasked with looking at alcohol policy and culture and is now due to report back to Senate about research progress.
	•	Alex Van Atta: Yeah, we formed this in the spring to research and analyze NU's alcohol policy as compared to other peer institutions with the goal of making a comprehensive evaluation of NU's alcohol policy.
	•	First met June 24th, decided on what universities to research based on administrative recommendations
	•	Met in September to get on same page and had more individual meetings leading up to deadline.
	•	Selected a list of schools to research between other COFHE schools and interesting cases like University of Indiana, U of C, Wash U
	•	Northwestern's Alcohol Policy
	•	Known as "Call, Stay, Cooperate"
	•	Call 911
	•	Stay with person
	•	Cooperate with emergency officials
	•	Incident will be documented
	•	“…This means that no formal University disciplinary actions or sanctions will be imposed for alcohol or drug infractions…”
	•	“…the incident will be documented, and educational, community, and health interventions – as well as contact with a student’s parents or family – may be required as a condition of deferring disciplinary actions or sanctions…”
	•	From data, many viewed alcohol as social lubricant and something to do- steps have been taken to give students more late night options
	•	Before coming to NU, only about 40% of students have had alcohol, after the first few months of freshman year, number increases to mid 70%
	•	Monika: Stanford implemented new alcohol policy highlighting high rish drinking as area of concern, provost spoke with parents about alcohol and targetted alcohol education and discouraged hard liquor consumption
	•	Alex Matelski: U of C has on campus pub, requires educational online course.
	•	Hampton: No alcohol at all, even if 21+
	•	Nothing notable.
	•	Wash U: "Students should be treated as responsible adults until proven otherwise" Very tolerant
	•	Indiana: Hoosier PACT- specifies medial amnesty for individual, caller and organizations- fosters community-wide "culture of care," that encourages calling over anything else.
	•	Notre Dame: Recent policy of prohibiting alcoholic beverages >14%. Resulted in fewer alcoholic containers found
	•	Ian: (Question) Research states that hard alcohol is worse than things like beer- did you do any research on this?
	•	Administration wouldn't give data and stated beer could be just as bad at harming students. We're under this assumption, the administration is not.
	•	Elder CA stated that all incidents of alcohol hospitalization was from hard alcohol
	•	University of Florida: Fine with non-hard alcohol, and it's PTI's old school
	•	Dartmouth: "Students seeking assistance will not be subject to disciplinary action after taking an educational course on alcohol."
	•	Alex Van Atta: Looking at some of the schools, saw schools implement student run system of third-party risk management. Would look for reckless behavior. They're trained and incredibly effective. Haverford showed that alcohol hospitalizations went to zero- can be paid by school and only requirements are four hour course and sobriety on the job. At Dartmouth, students get paid $44 a night for this, and this program has also been effective.
	•	Alex Van Atta: Inhibitions to Research
	•	Lack of willingness to release data about alcohol consumption
	•	Absence of communication or cooperation from administration stakeholders
	•	Lack of data from administration made our research much more difficult
	•	Administration appears to value their image over the safety of their students
	•	Alex Matelski: University should change campus drinking culture and make more realistic picture of campus drinking with an educational system to prepare students to make wise decisions. University should lend implicit trust to student to make wise decisions, emphasizing responsibility over punishments
	•	Monika: Other recommendations
	•	Northwestern University should institute a student-led organization for the indirect policing of campus parties via risk management. These groups should be university trained but only internally accountable, so as to develop trust between the organization, students, and organizations hosting parties.
	•	Northwestern University should provide for an anonymous exit survey following a hospitalization in order to gather more reliable data on demographics as well as geographic circumstances of dangerous behavior.
	•	Northwestern University should mandate Red Watch Band training for all student leaders so that no confusion or hesitation exist in the event of an emergency.
	•	Alex Matelski: University should monitor distribution of distilled liquors. Should also implement amnesty for students and organizations
	•	Ian: (Question) Can you formally back up the suggestion to limit distilled liquors with evidence and numbers
	•	Anonymous exit surveys provide that data and would ask what they've been drinking
	•	Alex: There's data from administrators that we can use, but not share
	•	Girish: (Question) how would the administration monitor limiting distilled liquors?
	•	Alex M: University has a lot of sway over local businesses and limiting such things.
	•	Alex Van Atta: Next steps
	•	Alcohol survey written and distributed campus-wide by end of Fall quarter
	•	Focusing on students’ knowledge of alcohol policy
	•	See if the current policy has caused hesitation when calling for help, or even stopped them from calling
	•	Analyze over Winter Break
	•	Go over recommendations with relevant parties (IFC, PHA, MGC, NPHC, RCB, RHA), get approval/amendments from exec boards, then proposed/voted on by ASG Senate
	•	Present to administration Winter Quarter
	•	We have good data from other schools, but we need to get more groups on board to get more push.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	John C:These recommendations to meet with other groups, when will this happen?
	•	Alex Van Atta: After we have data from our survey and have a more complete argument using our data and recommendations
	•	Mark: is the university doing anything formally for this?
	•	Monika: Dartmouth initiative: meets every 6 months to look at other schools for solutions to underage drinking incidents
	•	Alex Van Atta: Some consortium of schools in our tier has been meeting to compile a report in 2013.
	•	Michelle: Why isn't the Quaker Bouncer being recommended
	•	Alex Matelski: We did, still want to work out logistics
	•	Corrine: What is end goal for Notre Dame's policy?
	•	Alex Van Atta: It's an attempt to change campus culture
	•	Paul: If we instituted a Quaker Bouncer Program, where would we get funding from?
	•	Alex Matelski: Our recommendation is that it starts as a student group, not university funded work-study. Would move to that in the future
	•	Alex: These are just preliminary recommendations, will provide more info as details become available
	•	Sean: In terms of the relationship between the student group and the people throwing parties, how would this group be informed of parties happening?
	•	Alex Van Atta: Student groups would ideally come to them to have another sober individual watching over things.
	•	Alex Matelski: Would hopefully increase accountability
	•	Corrine: Why didn't they give it to you?
	•	Alex: Administration member said she couldn't give a copy of the data, didn't want data to get published.
	•	Monika: Tried higher-ups to get data, but got no response
	•	David H: How will you get this data? Through CAs? All campus email
	•	Alex: Still in preliminary stages of planning that aspect. Want to use initial survey to see if students know policy. Exit survey would be done through university, ideally.
	•	Monika: University doesn't have demographic info on drinking incidents at the moment
	•	Girish: Is there a way for other Senators to get involved with this process.
	•	Alex Van Atta: Yeah, seen lots of interest for this, we've had two people drop out so we could use more spots
	•	Brad: the seats are RCB and RHA's, as things are written, the open seats are designated to those respective bodies. Maybe edit legislation to change group constitution
	•	Ani: now is the time to redefine the membership of things like this.
	•	Ani: Other questions.
	•	Ani: Alright, they'll continue work and we'll take a candy break!

	•	General Order: Shuttle Working Group & Dorm Conditions Selection
	•	Ani: Lot has been spoken to you, now we'll elect people to two working groups which have since diminished. Focusing on Shuttle and Dorm Conditions Working Groups
	•	Transportation Working Group
	•	Ani: Katie, Victor- can you give some background about the working group?
	•	Katie: Victor and I worked on transportation working group which focused on shuttles and pointed out problems with shuttles to administration. There are lots of hidden restrictions with changing the schedule, and that was the roadblock we hit. We definitely need more people. The work would probably entail sending out a survey to students about shuttles and using those results to make a recommendation/proposal to the administration. Wouldn't be huge time commitment, but would be some work
	•	Victor: Saferide?
	•	Katie: Worked with a class to see ways SafeRide can be improved. I only have a limited knowledge about it, but it's something we can definitely work on
	•	Victor: lots of room for improvement with SafeRide's infrastructure- maybe look into vendors for different technology for SafeRide management?
	•	Katie: It'd be ideal if we could have 1-2 people to focus on SafeRide and 1-2 on shuttles
	•	Ani: 2 spots, great for a deep dive into an issue and start proposing solutions to that problem. Any questions about this working group?
	•	Ani: Alright, nominations?
	•	Ian Coley: I nominate Ian Hendrickson
	•	Ian Hendrickson: I accept
	•	Ian Coley: I nominate Mike Morgan
	•	Mike: I accept
	•	Ani: The nomination period is now closed. Ian, Mike- please give introductory speeches about why you want to join this working group.
	•	Mike: Really interested in getting voice heard on this issue and improving shuttles/saferide for students
	•	Ian: Really using SafeRide more often now that I'm off-campus and can see that things need to be changed. Not sure of what I can change right now, but will be able to talk with people who have thoughts on the subject
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Noah: What are the problems you have w/ SafeRide
	•	Ian: Every organization can be better- want to work on the operational side of it.
	•	Mike: Definitely ways to improve wait times and make the service more accessible. Also want to review when SafeRide operators tell people to take shuttles, and that's not always and option.
	•	Mark: Ways to reduce fuel consumption per capita of SafeRide cars?
	•	Mike: ways to reduce fuel consumption? Might be beyond the scope of our committee...wouldn't know how to make it better.
	•	Ian: when the working group got to that point, we'd talk to you for input.
	•	Ani: Other Questions?
	•	Ian: Motion to white ballot?
	•	Second
	•	Objections?
	•	Ani: White ballot instantly moves candidates into spots
	•	Vote, passed unanimously
	•	Dorm Conditions Working Group
	•	Ani: Fizzled out after completing work last year, have heard from Senators they'd like to work on it, 3 spots open and an opportunity to work on tangible issues
	•	Brad: Difference from the work RHA/RCB does
	•	Ani: Dorm Conditions Working Group meant to centralize and formalize solutions to these problems outside of the traditional means of trying to solve these problems- would be tasked with evaluating ways to call attention to facilities problems. Would work in conjunction with Student Life and RHA/RCB Senators
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Harrison: Time commitment?
	•	Ani: Working groups are traditionally self-governing- responsible to report to me and Alex and Senate, but working groups try to split the work equally and self-govern. Great for taking ownership of projects, time commitment is what you make of it.
	•	Ani: Any other questions? Nominations?
	•	Lauren: Nominate Morgan Hunt
	•	Morgan: I accept
	•	Lauren: Nominate Harrison Flagler
	•	Harrison: I accept
	•	Chris Harlow: I nominate myself
	•	Chris: I accept
	•	Ani: Nomination period is now closed- please come up and speak about why you want to be on this working group
	•	Morgan: Lived in Sargent before, now live in Kemper, there are a multitude of problems to address
	•	Chris: Freshman in SESP in LOC & Econ, in community relations committee- wanted to work with Evanston City Government, but living in Elder and wants to use opportunity to address problems in on-campus life to better prepare for off-campus work
	•	Harrison: Live in NMQ- showers are cold, there are centipedes, as a freshman, I can see issues in my own dorm and others
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian: How will you make sure you're looking at all dorms on campus when evaluating?
	•	Morgan: Send out survey to residents
	•	Chris: Creep through all the dorms
	•	Harrison: They already stated the best methods, maybe as a group, survey all the dorms on campus and decide what needs to be improved
	•	Alex Lower: NU probably won't want to renovate every dorm on campus, what are low-budget solutions to focus on?
	•	Chris: Student happiness, shower conditions and curtains/doors, putting in water fountains (for the long term). Wants to focus on small things that can make an impact. Smoking receptacles…
	•	Harrison: Dorms like Elder won't need a huge amount of money for renovations- need to get all the dorms up to the same base-line, like getting air conditioning for all dorms- then can work on stuff like showers to get all of the dorms to a point where none of them can be considered bad.
	•	Morgan: my first priority would be bugs because they're gross, then things that are manageable, like shower curtains
	•	Mark: Personal experience with housing, facilities management?
	•	Harrison: Bizarre problem that only my room lost power- communicated heavily with facilities. Was part of a high school that was over
	•	Morgan: Has worked with these departments in the past
	•	Chris: Worked with online request system for work orders, reserved a room… not much else other than that
	•	Ian: How to make sure capital improvements will be done in a sustainable way?
	•	Morgan: work with sustainability and Mark Silberg
	•	Chris: Work with companies in Chicago and stuff like light bulbs
	•	Harrison: Would consult sustainability
	•	Ian: How to work with RHA/RCB?
	•	Chris: Would talk to that one marketing guy in RCB… would contact RHA. Lot of places to cover and lots of sources for information.
	•	Harrison: Will be the person to meet with RHA to convey information for caucus and will use that consult with RHA about these issues.
	•	Morgan: Will communicate through Harrison and be sure to remain in contact otherwise
	•	Alex Lower: Will this cover things prohibited in dorms like microwaves, Christmas lights?
	•	Ani: That's Illinois Code… but they can look into it
	•	Jane: Motion to close question period
	•	Accepted
	•	Ian: Motion to white ballot
	•	Accepted, passed unanimously, new members approved

	•	Old Business: SL1213-08: Service and Community Engagement Grant
	•	Chris Harlow: I'm Brad for Halloween
	•	Ani: 2 minutes to go over legislation
	•	Chris: Want to pull $500 from project pool, by the first of March, selection committee will present three choices to fund to Senate and then fund groups accordingly. NUnite has a grant for collaboration, but it's very different from what we want to do
	•	Steven: Money for collaboration
	•	Mike: Goals of the two opportunities are totally different- our bill wants to encourage groups to do programming off campus for betterment of community
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Rebecca: Long timeline, reasoning for dates?
	•	Chris: No reasoning at all
	•	Mike: Nooo, we want to give the working group time to build up and get prepared for this, want to give people a chance to work on this over Winter Break.
	•	Steven: do you have any other suggestions for the timeline…?
	•	Ani: Not in line
	•	Jane: Motion to close question period
	•	Ian: Motion to amend, change from Reading Week to penultimate Senate
	•	Previous question on the amendment
	•	Passed unanimously
	•	Jane: (Question) How much in Project Pool after this
	•	David C: Around $7,000
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question
	•	Ani: moving to a vote on the bill, ending debate
	•	Vote, legislation passed unanimously

	•	Old Business: SR1213-02: Northwestern Climate Commitment
	•	Mark: This resolution confirms our commitment to a greenhouse gas review, it's all in the legislation. Questions?
	•	Ian: Motion to amend… rescinded, change was already made
	•	Ani: Pro/Con?
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote, passed unanimously
	•	Ani: Great, we'll send this to Morty

	•	New Business: SL1213-09: NU Day at the United Center
	•	Brad: Yay, I get to talk. As talked about last week, this got brought up at the beginning of last year, but the lockout killed this. CSI wants to revive project and wants money from ASG. Asking to help cover $20,000 cost, some of this will be covered by students buying tickets- people will be able to sit in a student section at the United Center, this funding would also cover travel.
	•	Brad: One of the concerns was if this event would happen without our funding, without our funding would be able to purchase fewer tickets and would diminish the event's impact. Would get great publicity and would really connect students
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Motoki: Can we amend to possibly change the date?
	•	Brad: it's up to the Bulls
	•	Motoki: Like if one date was cheaper?
	•	Brad: You can amend, but CSI needs to know they can get the money before selecting the date
	•	Noah: where's the rest of the $20,000 coming from? And we cover 5%, why would our non-commitment reduce attendance?
	•	Brad: Lots of other things that go into the $20,000, other organizations like RHA are submitting much more, can't speak to exact seat decrease, but that was the example I've given
	•	Ian: Can you come back with a line item budget and other contributors?
	•	Brad: Line-item budget doesn't exist, not determining budget until they know how much money they have. I can't dictate to them to come up with it, it's not our event.
	•	Mark: historical attendance numbers for NU Day at Wrigley?
	•	Brad: NU Day at Wrigley has higher attendance- 800-1000 or more and open to faculty, not just students. Since this is more expensive and the weather is worse, they expect that interest  would be lower, and the Bulls don't think we can fill more than 300 seats with no prior experience doing this.
	•	Rebecca: Could there still be a decrease in attendance even if we give this money?
	•	Brad: Potentially, yes.
	•	Alex Lower: If other groups end up giving more money, will we get less publicity?
	•	Brad: No
	•	Jane: How much left in the project pool after this?
	•	Brad: $6000
	•	Motoki: Once we pass this, is there any push you can make to change the date…?
	•	Brad: If you write it into the legislation, I'll convey that request
	•	Ani: Alright, will be old business next week.

	•	New Business: SL1213-10: In-Senate Voting Procedure
	•	Ian: This is really important- some previous votes through plurality have been unfair. Preferential voting is basically ranking the candidates, and removing loser to … … … … basically look on the website and in the legislation for how to do it.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Alex Lower:  Do you think it'll take longer to count?
	•	Ian: It will, but it's better for democracy and Senate's interests
	•	Rebecca: Who counts votes?
	•	Ani: Parliamentary Body
	•	Mark: Economic basis for this form of voting?
	•	Ani: Not going to allow that
	•	David Harris: How to disincentive strategic voting?
	•	Ian: Hopefully senators aren't trying to rig the system.
	•	Dana: Who takes minutes while votes are being counted
	•	Ani: The Senator pro tempore, or someone from Exec
	•	Ani: this will be old business next week

	•	New Business: SR1213-03: Helping Those Affected by Hurricane Sandy
	•	Victor: This resolution is in response to Hurricane Sandy and voicing support for the East Coast. It's a sign of support and encouragement to donate. Would send out email voicing support.
	•	Mark: Want to move to old business since this is time sensitive
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Mike: If this was passed, I know this says the student body supports this, but will there be follow-up to actually get the word out about our support?
	•	Victor: Haven't considered other donors to submit money, but can, and will send out email over ASG channels for wider distribution, it's something we'll talk to PTI about as well
	•	John C: Motion to move to old business
	•	Passed unanimously
	•	Motion to Previous question
	•	Ian: objection
	•	Ani: We'll move into pro/con on moving to previous question
	•	Ian (pro): I feel like there's a greater point of resolving legislation that needs to be discussed.
	•	Rebecca (con): We should go to a vote
	•	Mike (pro): Should still give opportunities for a pro/con
	•	Noah (con): Urgency of situation lends itself to passing it now, can think of other solutions in  the time ahead
	•	Mark (pro): Agree with Ian, if you have something to say, let's just go ahead with the legislation
	•	Ani: Seeing no other cons, moving to a vote of whether to move to vote on this immediately.
	•	Vote- Division
	•	21 in favor
	•	13 against
	•	1 abstention
	•	2/3 majority needed to move to previous question- motion to previous question fails
	•	Ani: Moving on to pro/con
	•	Mike (pro): I'm from New York, seeing the destruction is devastating, more needs to be stated to publicize this message. I'm very much in support of this legislation though. We need to put the action into it
	•	Ian (con): what we want here is more action on an issue- resolution doesn't necessitate positive action on anyone's part. Saying that we support people doing things isn’t effective. Need to change so that resolutions are meaningful- consider that we can write something more actionable.
	•	Rebecca (pro): Writing resolutions in support of things are what legislative bodies do. Action is necessary, but there's no reason not to pass this right now. It's a way of showing we care and shouldn't be stopped because there's no action behind it.
	•	Steven (pro): I would recommend adding something in to put real action behind this
	•	Ani: After passing a resolution, we show the resolution to other relevant parties and can broadcast this message under the terms of a resolution.
	•	Motoki: Motion to previous question

Senate Adjourned 

ASG Senate Minutes
11-07-12

	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	Brad: David also wanted me to talk about the three surveys linked in his exec board report since he can't be here.
	•	Another food truck festival to benefit hurricane sandy damages
	•	Alex: Read my exec board report and be on the lookout for tonight's legislation. Email me if you have questions
	•	Carly: Thanks to those that came out on Friday for the Social- will be planning meetings with Senators in the upcoming weeks
	•	Girish: Funding recommendations are live, look at them.
	•	Steven: OBAMA. Also moving forward with the housing fair and look out for other publicity materials, especially people looking for apartments.
	•	Will also be implementing service through off campus housing office to search for apartments
	•	David Chi: Talked to Ricoh, looking at other printing companies.
	•	Lauren: Not much new- did preliminary work on funding apps- you'll see those next Wednesday.
	•	Mark: Eco-rep program is up and running. There are 40 eco-reps from greek houses and RHA/RCB. If you have ideas about what sort of programming would be appropriate for these reps, let me know. ASG sustainability oversees them.
	•	Hayley: Cool event with the office of the Provost and Political Union about Affirmative Action, December 5th, Harris 107.
	•	Also updates about academic requirement, let me know if you want to get involved
	•	Also putting together cultural DM groups, let me know if you're interested in that.

	•	General Order: New Student Group Subcommittee confirmations
	•	Ani: We're approving the subcommittee you guys created
	•	Ian: Why are we doing confirmations?
	•	Ani: Yeah, they actually don't need to be confirmed since they aren't actual members
	•	Lauren: I want Senate to know about this anyway- The New Student Groups Committee (NSGC) works with new groups- we've had an exponential increase in new student groups and we created a separate committee to oversee this.
	•	Refer people who want to start new student groups to Jesse & Angela, the two new members of the NSGC
	•	Ani: Please introduce yourselves
	•	Angela: I'm sick- let Jesse talk. I'm from Indiana, majoring in psych and a Junior
	•	Jesse: Just transferred here from Miami as a Junior
	•	We both interviewed to be on SGC and Lauren let us know about the large number of new groups and thought that we could help these groups with ASG recognition. It's exciting and lets us work with lots of people. Questions?
	•	Mark: Do you always personify student groups?
	•	Jesse: Sometimes I just giraffify them...

	•	Old Business: SL1213-09: NU Day at the United Center
	•	Brad: CSI wants $1000 from ASG to fund NU Day at the United Center. We get good press, and it's a good service to the student body. Students will get bused down with subsidized tickets and a t-shirt
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian C: Any other confirmed donor organizations in the past week?
	•	Brad: Natalie, do you know?
	•	Natalie: Don't know.
	•	Ian C: To the same end, is there a clearer budget now?
	•	Brad: unfortunately not
	•	Henry: What teams would be playing on each date?
	•	Motoki: Cavaliers on January 7th, Pistons on March 31st
	•	Jane: March 31st is during spring break… so…
	•	Brad: I am pretty confident that if that's the case, CSI wouldn't be looking at it as a date
	•	Noah: The 7th is the beginning of recruitment for sororities
	•	Several Senators: No it's not
	•	Senator: Wouldn't it be hard to sell tickets if it's the first day back?
	•	Brad: CSI would hopefully have most if not all of the tickets sold by then.
	•	Girish: what will this money go toward exactly?
	•	Brad: Could go to tickets, transportation or t-shirts- we could mandate that it goes to a certain area, I'm sure.
	•	Girish: Just trying to figure out the direct benefit of giving them $1000 as opposed to not doing it
	•	Brad: We get publicity, and the first thing they'll take away from the event are tickets for students
	•	Girish: So they don't want to deviate from the ticket price?
	•	Brad: Lots of moving parts, will maximize what money they get, but let me know that they'd reduce tickets sold before increasing ticket prices
	•	Ciara: Are those the only two dates available?
	•	Brad: Still negotiating with Bulls, but will try to work with them to pick a good date. It's CSI, they're not going to pick a date where people won't go
	•	Ian Hendrickson: How far along is this planning process if the date isn't set? Or publicity?
	•	Brad: Came to us at the beginning of the school year, but stuff on campus caused it to be pushed back. Came to us again looking into winter quarter or fall quarter, but need to move on this soon if we're going to give them money
	•	Evan: Most of NU would rather have more seats as opposed to t-shirts. Can we negotiate this?
	•	Brad: T-shirts are a fixed cost, we either buy t-shirts for everyone or for no one. CSI wants to maximize the number of students going to this, obviously, but it's a unity thing having students all there wearing matching t-shirts...
	•	Motoki: So, is the second day on spring break...?
	•	Brad: If that is the case… I don't have a good answer to that question
	•	Nouha: Can we really negotiate that we get less t-shirts and more tickets?
	•	Brad: Bulls won't let us get more than 300 for any individual game right now- hopefully can increase ticket sales next year
	•	Dana: Quality of the tickets?
	•	Brad: All group sales are 300 level seats. They're high up, but not terrible seats
	•	Ani: If no further questions, moving into pro/con
	•	Ian (con): real lack of detail here. Not having a budget for this event is unacceptable, should be able to calculate these costs per capita. And if we don't know if anyone is funding this, we have no way of knowing if we'll reach that $20,000 point to actually fund the event.
	•	Michelle (con): We don't fund new events with our student groups, why do it here?
	•	Girish: Point of Information- while I'd usually agree with you, that procedure is meant to prevent student groups from doing last minute programming spur of the moment- not for University departments like CSI.
	•	Victor (pro): This event is ambiguous and unclear right now, but this is the Center for Student involvement, and that should be taken into consideration. ASG could inspire other groups to fund this, we need to be the leader on this to make sure this gets fully funded. If they can't raise enough money, CSI will cancel it. Our funding could be the difference between 200 or 300 seats. We can communicate that transportation and tickets are a priority. It's important to lend our support for this event as a community and it's a great opportunity to engage with Chicago
	•	Motoki: Motion to amend
	•	Motoki: Amend to add clause - "Be it further enacted by the ASG here assembled, that we recommend CSI to choose a different date"
	•	Motoki: Dates are inconvenient- and injured players might be back in. ASG should have the power to voice student opinion.
	•	Ani: Questions on the amendment?
	•	Mark: Shouldn't we revise our stance to make our funding conditional on a convenient date?
	•	Motoki: Don't think we have that sort of power, but can relay what students want.
	•	April: I feel like this would make it harder for students to attend since it'd be during a busier time
	•	Motoki: Just a way to tell CSI this is what students want. We should cover our ground and try to make sure the best date is picked.
	•	Dana: Just want to say "we'd prefer a later date" with this amendment?
	•	Motoki: Yep
	•	Jesse: Not a question really but...
	•	Ani: Not in line
	•	Ian: Enacting legislation only compels officers and members of ASG to do something, not sure if this amendment is in line…
	•	Noah: Will Ian's point negate this from working?
	•	Ani: Brad will pressure CSI
	•	Ani: If no further questions, we'll move into pro/con on the amendment
	•	Jesse(con): we can trust Brad to actually negotiate this.
	•	Mark (con): if we're so worried about the date, we should make our funding contingent on a good date- otherwise, I trust Brad to negotiate.
	•	Motoki (pro): Mark's idea of us setting a date is a bad idea. We should mandate it to make sure- only way to make sure it will happen
	•	Mark (con): Need carrots and sticks- this amendment doesn't have weight otherwise
	•	Dana (pro): Excited about this event and people are excited, but don't agree with Mark. We need to fund this event no matter what, it gives a good push as things are now
	•	Mark (con): personal stance is that there is no need for an amendment, but if we're going to give a recommendation on the date, we should make it contingent on funding
	•	Vote on amendment- unclear.
	•	Motion: Division
	•	Yea: 22
	•	Opposed: 18
	•	Abstentions: 3
	•	Amendment passes
	•	Motion to previous question
	•	Ani: moving to a vote on the bill as a whole
	•	Vote- approved. Bill is passed.

	•	Old Business: SL1213-10: In-Senate Voting Procedure
	•	Ian: not an exciting bill, but a necessary one. Preferential voting is necessary for democracy
	•	Ian: As things are now, it's just whoever gets the most votes. Way to rectify this is through preferential voting, where you rank selections for a position, eliminate those who don't have enough votes, look at their second choice. Outlined that plural voting system doesn't yield the same results as preferential one. It's good for democracy.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Jesse: How much time will this add to the process?
	•	Ian: Shouldn’t add much more time to the process and that shouldn’t be the reason we don’t want to do this.
	•	Alex Lower: Been voting with plurality for a while now, what prompted this change?
	•	Ian: saw this in code review and realized this is very bad. It's about the same for small elections.
	•	Henry: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Legislation is passed.
	•	Ian: Can the record reflect it passed unanimously?
	•	Ani: Sure, put it on your resume…
	•	Ian: This is important!

	•	New Business: A-Status Funding Recommendations
	•	Girish: You should have funding recommendations now. Make sure you guys are actually thinking about these recommendations. You have full power to change all of this next Wednesday. Let me know if you have any questions
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Ian H: I didn't get the email
	•	Ani: Not distributed yet by email, it's on the agenda
	•	Ian C: Is this being distributed on the ASG News listserv?
	•	Brad: I can…
	•	Motoki: Will SAFC be doing it's pre-funding hearing to prevent insufficient tiers?
	•	Girish: Yeah, in the past insufficient tiers just led to problems, we sort out a lot of those issues now before funding.

	•	New Business: SL1213-11: Working Group on Dining Hall Hours & Weekend Locations
	•	Ani: McKenzie, Petros- can you guys come up and talk about this?
	•	Petros: In discussions with RHA/RCB caucus and Student Life, we've begun the process of talking to administration about reforming dining hall hours. Most dining halls open too early. Maybe try pushing it back an hour? Also exploring if, on weekends, dining hall options can be expanded. Working group will explore options, send surveys, etc, and report back to senate
	•	McKenzie: Going off of word-of-mouth concerns- hope to use working group to see actual feelings about dining halls
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Mark: Why haven't you met with Sodexho?
	•	Petros: Just at a starting point right now
	•	Alex: Spoke with JPK, and we're arranging meetings like that to happen
	•	Ian C: The legislation says the constituent bodies select the RHA/RCB members of the committee
	•	Petros: Assume it would be determined by caucus whip
	•	Sarah: Legislation says "at minimum" for RHA/RCB members, does that leave room for expansion?
	•	Petros: Exactly!
	•	Ian C: Can non-RHA/RCB caucus people join this?
	•	McKenzie: We welcome others to help work on this if they want to
	•	Motoki: Is the claim that 4:45 is too early for dinner based on research? Or is this where you'll be looking for more data?
	•	Petros: Want to survey on this to gather more data.
	•	Mark: a lot of times we form working groups that seek to change things that end up being out of our hands. Would you be willing to wait on this legislation until meeting with nuCusine and get more info
	•	Petros: if we were to push this legislation back, it wouldn't give us much time following winter break to do all the work.
	•	McKenzie: Student Life was already working on this, a lot of the groundwork has been laid.
	•	Ani: This will be old business next week..
	•	Brad: Motion to make this old business
	•	Mark: Objection
	•	Ani: Moving to a debate on moving to old business. Brad can you speak on the motion?
	•	Brad: would like to make this old business due to funding next week- it'll be an already late Senate and we need everyone's attention directed to funding. Everyone's behind this, let's pass it now.
	•	Mark (con): we have 150 people in ASG who are critical to improving life at NU. This hasn't been well researched, and allocates resources away from Senators on an issue we don't even know if we can address. Let's not pass it until we're sure we can work on this.
	•	Chris (pro): I knew about this last week- I've heard complaints about this since I came here and there's definitely work that we can do
	•	Noah (pro): Also, Sodexho is contracted by administration, so we should contact the administration before contacting Sodexho. Also, the point of a working group is to get more information
	•	Ian C (Question): Why did you decide to assign Senators to work on this issue?
	•	Alex: I didn't- Senator survey showed this to be a relevant issue and figured it'd be good to get Senators involved with this and work with Student Life.
	•	Ian C (Question): Do you think starting investigation right now would be fruitful?
	•	Alex: Yes- JPK is busy, so the sooner we get this on the agenda, sooner things will get done. We're forming this to meet with people and figure out the best options
	•	Ian C: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- approved. Legislation is old business.
	•	Ani: Now old business- do the authors want to say anything else about this legislation?
	•	Petros: All our ideas are suggestions, will do more research before moving on anything. Purpose of working group was to see if it's at all possible.
	•	Alex: Because this is an issue with all students, this might just be a committee to research future ways to improve
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Motoki: Who would the Senator members be?
	•	McKenzie: That's us- left it open so others could get involved though.
	•	Ian: Motion to amend
	•	Should clarify as to how ASG members on the working group are selected
	•	Amendment: "Be it further enacted, that the working group shall consist of, at minimum, two RHA/RCB Senators, appointed by the RHA/RCB Caucus Whip; and two members of the Student Life Committee, appointed by their Student Life Vice President , and up to two  and overseen by the Student Life Vice President and the Speaker of the Senate. "
	•	Clarifies things and allows others to join
	•	Ani: Questions on the amendment?
	•	Motoki: Why these changes?
	•	Ian: Good to clarify that Senate needs to approve and need to consider other stakeholders in this
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question on the amendment
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Legislation is amended.
	•	Dana: Motion to amend
	•	Dana: Change to "most dining halls open at 4:45" and take out subjective claim that this is too early.
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Legislation is amended.
	•	Motoki (Question): Will the working group be formed upon the passage of the bill, or will there be a delay in the working group's start?
	•	Ani: Working group can be started at any time.
	•	Mark: Motion to amend
	•	Mark: Amend final clause to state: "Be it further enacted, that the working group shall report back to Senate no later than February 6, 2013, with comprehensive research on student preferences and concerns regarding dining hall hours and weekend locations; the research shall take into consideration input from administrators and students, as well as proposals for possible changes, in line with practices at peer institutions."
	•	Mark: want solutions to this problem to be well structured and complete
	•	Ian H: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Legislation is amended.
	•	Ogbemi: Motion to amend- disagree with the line that says that there isn't enough room for people to sit.
	•	Ogbemi: I've never seen this, strike part of principle that says "as there is rarely enough space for everyone to sit and eat during peak weekend hours."
	•	Paul (con): In your experience, you might not have seen it, but living in 1835 for 2 years, I've seen bad seating situations, and it can get pretty crowded
	•	Jane (con): has also been a problem in Sargent
	•	Jesse (pro): don't think it's a giant issue, maybe it forces you to make new friends and would lead to increasing dining hall size.
	•	Dana (pro): Just striking inflamatory language, there's still something in the legislation to increase dining hall size
	•	McKenzie: Never our intention to increase size of dining halls
	•	Brad (con): A lot of this can be researched when the working group begins. And the purpose of the principle is to make an argument  Also, students sitting on the ground is well documented problem
	•	Motion to Previous Question
	•	Vote- approved. Legislation is amended.
	•	Motoki: Motion to previous question on the bill
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Bill is passed.

	•	New Business: SL1213-12: NU Hearts Transgender Initiatives
	•	Paul: Last Spring, Rainbow Alliance made gender-neutral bathrooms an issue. Gender neutral bathrooms are single stall bathrooms that can be used by either gender. There are trans-gender students on campus, can make them feel uncomfortable and can raise problems. Bathrooms were put into Tech, but they're really inconvenient and hard to find
	•	Alex: Rainbow will be working on this, it'll be great if diversity and inclusion committee can also get this done. There will be lots of peer institution research, meetings with facilities management.
	•	Paul: Would be made up of 4 members of Rainbow, 2 diversity committee members and 2 senators.
	•	Alex: It would be overseen by Hayley, AVP for Diversity and Inclusion. Asked Rainbow Alliance if they could use help from ASG and they welcomed it.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Jesse: Point of information- what's the problem with handicap bathrooms with single stall?
	•	Paul: no problem, just not a lot of those. 3 gender neutral bathrooms in one wing of tech isn't good enough
	•	Motoki: Any reason that there's no oversight in the Rainbow members selected for this? If it's because they're already working on it, can we meet them?
	•	Alex: the precedent we've set is that the organizations we work with appoint their own members. We gave them freedom to choose who would be appointed
	•	Paul: Wouldn't be a problem, just would be dragging part of the Rainbow exec board to Senate. It just wouldn't be necessary
	•	Mark: Motion to move this to old business
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Bill is now old business.
	•	Ian C: Motion to amend
	•	Two bits
	•	Change reporting date to February 6th
	•	Change wording of how Senators are selected
	•	"Be it further enacted that the ad-hoc committee shall be composed of four members appointed by the Executive Board of the Rainbow Alliance; and two Diversity and Inclusion Committee members, appointed by the Associate Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion and confirmed and two Senators elected by the Associated Student Government upon passing of this legislation.  The group will be overseen by the Associated Student Government Associate Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion."
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Both amendments are now included in the bill.
	•	Ian C: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Bill is passed.

	•	New Business: SR1213-04: Lightwalk Report
	•	Alex: this is the culmination of me and Jane’s work on Lightwalk for the previous 4-5 months.
	•	Jane: it was a long process, met with administrators, surveyed, did the Lightwalk
	•	Alex: this is being proposed now to send to all of the stakeholders and put the full force of Senate behind it.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Motoki: In the final report, will you change abbreviations?
	•	Alex: We can?
	•	Chris: Biggest hope for change that administrators will enact out of this?
	•	Jane: Put lighting near tennis courts on west side of Sheridan
	•	Alex: Administration was confident that all of these changes could be implemented.
	•	Sarah: Are the locations in order of importance?
	•	Jane: Organized by order of importance
	•	Sofia: The survey mentioned survey- how many students responded?
	•	Alex: UBPC survey data, so right around 2000
	•	Motoki: Would some people prefer some of these areas to be dark?
	•	Alex: all of this was based on survey data and observations
	•	David H: I've heard that lighting can be good for muggers since it limits night vision- if lighting is switched, could this be a potential problem?
	•	Alex: this is why this is important- going from light to dark is a problem we have
	•	Legislation is old business...
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Resolution is passed.

	•	Special Order: Election & Confirmation of Gender Neutral Facilities ad-hoc committee
	•	Sarah Watson: (Read by Hayley) “I want to be on this working group because this has been an idea that has been talked about for a long time and I believe that it is an important one. No longer is our society insisting that people subscribe themselves to only male or female, and the facilities of our institution should reflect that.A bathroom should be a safe space for whatever gender someone identifies with. I think that ASG has a unique opportunity considering its relations with other student groups as well as the administration to further push this issue as one that is important to bringing our community closer and making it safer. And, as a member of this working group I will do all that I can to make sure that happens.”
	•	Vote- approved unanimously.
	•	Rachel: (Read by Alex) My name is Rachel Leshin, and I’m a sophomore here at Northwestern currently serving on ASG’s Diversity & Inclusion committee. I’m interested in working on the initiative to establish gender-neutral spaces on campus because I think that in order to model itself as a truly inclusive and accepting place, Northwestern must be willing to accommodate all identities. The system as it stands now, in which the overwhelming majority of facilities are marked as either “male” or “female,” only serves to reinforce a rigid, restrictive binary that leaves certain members of our campus community out of the picture. As a prospective Gender Studies major, I’m a firm believer in the idea that we as individuals have the right to choose our own gender identities, and for some, this may mean straddling both genders, choosing to embrace neither, or finding ground somewhere in between the two. Gender-neutral spaces would ensure that no student felt boxed in by any set of expectations or norms and would work to ensure that all students felt comfortable, welcome, and accepted across campus. As a member of ASG as well as of the larger campus community, I’m passionate about doing all that I can to ensure that Northwestern embodies this ideal.
	•	Vote- approved unanimously.
	•	Nominations open for Senator spots on the Gender Neutral Facilities ad-hoc committee
	•	Ian: I nominate myself
	•	Corey B: I nominate myself
	•	Ciara: I nominate April.
	•	April: I accept
	•	Ian: I rescind my nomination, I'm busy enough already.
	•	Ani: introduce yourselves
	•	Cory: This is a subject I'm interested in and engaged with and I'd like to echo some of the sentiments stated. This is an important and under-represent sect of diversity
	•	April: Friends opened my eyes to issues transgendered people face. We need more gender-neutral bathrooms because it is a big problem that needs to be fixed
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Dana: Other time commitments?
	•	Cory: Not on other ASG standing committees, should have time. Other commitments are small.
	•	Aprli: Work at SPAC, not on a committee and I have time for it, so I'll make time for it
	•	Ian: Motion to white ballot
	•	Ani: means there are as many candidates as spots and to move them immediately into the positions
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Both candidates are confirmed as members of the ad-hoc.

	•	Emergency Legislation: ASG Weakly
	•	Mark: Motion to bring a piece of emergency legislation to the floor
	•	Ian C: Second
	•	Ani: Can you come up and explain the legislation?
	•	Mark: Didn't realize funding was next week- makes sense for it to come up today. Has to do with the formatting of ASG emails- constituents have said it's hard to read or useless, so we need work to improve this.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Brad: We're doing this, why the legislation?
	•	Mark: Felt compelled to do this as a Senator- it’s our responsibility to bring up things we want changed through legislation
	•	Rebecca: Where is this coming from and why?
	•	Mark: A problem with the ASG Weekly is that submitted announcements don't always make it onto the Weekly, we need a better system
	•	Ani: The weekly includes announcements and other things brought up during good of the order. If your announcements didn't make it into the Weekly, you emailed my personal account, rather than my speaker account, and it got lost in my email. It isn't that hard to do.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con on moving this to emergency legislation.
	•	Brad (con): This legislation came as a shock to exec- we're implementing changes to the ASG weekly already, could've come and talked to us about this before proposing legislation.
	•	Ian (question): how long has the process of reforming this been going on and what's the work that's been done?
	•	Brad: we're looking at programs now to do this, and ASG technology is strained already.
	•	Ian (pro): This is the first I've heard of working on a template. Not realistic that it'll magically appear. Will put more constraints on the PR committee to do this and not strain tech committee
	•	Mark (pro): Legislation sets a very specific timeline- and not just about the template. This is about making announcements easier to digest for our constituents
	•	Chris (con): This is a ridiculous timeline. We've talked about not rushing things for weeks, but now we're rushing this to completion in two weeks. Should contact Ethan and other tech individuals
	•	Ian H (Question): Is this new business?
	•	Ani: Emergency legislation once approved is new business, yes.
	•	Rebecca (con): I have a big problem with the fact that this wasn't brought up to exec previously- these sorts of changes should be discussed with exec before we, as Senate, see legislation about it.
	•	Motoki (pro): will trust Brad and Becca for this, but Senate has the power to make exec do things. Let's hear the legislation, we shouldn't just shut it down
	•	Henry (con): not knowing about funding next week is not a good reason to bypass Rules and bring it to the floor directly. There's no excuse for this.
	•	Lauren (con): it's ridiculous to say this is an emergency and Becca should've been consulted. There's no reason to hear this.
	•	McKenzie (con): I'm on Public Relations and we're working on this, just not something we can do instantly
	•	Mark (pro):  Motoki is right, but my constituents came to me about this, so it's our job as Senators to bring legislation. Could pass this into old business now. Would be glad to help with this template, it's not hard to do.
	•	Brad (con): we are happy to have this done by next week- we don't need legislation to do this, stakeholders weren't consulted. We're more than happy to work with you on this- presenting the legislation in this way makes it seem like a power-grab between Senate and Exec.
	•	Ani: In line for a vote on bringing this to the floor
	•	Vote- fails. Legislation on the floor is not made emergency.

	•	Good of the Order and Announcements
	•	Brad: Door decs and flyers are available, come and get them.
	•	Katie: I'm a student coordinator for a program called Amped- apply for it
	•	David: Two DM announcements
	•	DM trivia started 5 mins ago, will go on for a while, you should go over
	•	Launched collaboration with Mighty Nest- all purchases through Mighty Nest will have a portion go to DM
	•	Please take the surveys in my exec board report
	•	Ian: CCI Business Symposium, next week 6-8 in McTrib
	•	Victor: Camp Kesem apps due tonight
	•	Ani: Seniors- fill out DSTA applications
	•	Also fill out the visits form

Senate Adjourned 



Northwestern University
Associated Student Government
Meeting of the Senate
November, 12, 2014

	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	General Order: Wildcat Connection
	•	Isaac: Wildcat Connection is terrible. I don’t like it. Productive thoughts! The layout is not intuitive and it’s really hard to organize the groups you are in or have access to. The forms through it are simpler than qualtrics, so it’s not really useful. You can’t customize your page. 
	•	Moira: The mobile version doesn’t really work, because there is no way to log in. The feature where people post their events, that bulletin board seems to have the same outdated things. I don’t know if that’s because people don’t post or because it’s not updated. 
	•	Robert: A lot of the information does not seem to be up to date. 
	•	Nehaarika: I feel like it would be a good tool for freshmen, but most of my friends don’t know what it is. When I did try to use it, I wanted to search broadly and it doesn’t come up with a good list. 
	•	Erik: The search engine could certainly be improved. In terms of accessing finances it is pretty helpful. All treasurers with their SOFO accounts, they have their audit trail. We used to have to use a paper trail, but now there is an online audit trail. For applications it tends to be pretty easy, too. 
	•	Grace: Are all groups on wildcat connection? 
	•	Serene: Yes. 
	•	Grace: In that case I think it could be a very good tool, because everyone is on it, but that last event posted was a long time ago. 
	•	Jonathan: Wildcat Connection is not connected to any social media site. Lots of student groups use social media so the lack of connection is a struggle. 
	•	-: You can set up direct links, so that’s the most useful part of it. But that is all I would use it for. 
	•	Kenny: That’s true, but you need to go to each individual page. I would like if a group creates a facebook event it automatically connects to a calendar. I think facebook is the go to for facebook events, right now. 
	•	Kevin: I think there could be an integration with PlanIt Purple and other sites as well. 
	•	Serene: Someone who has not tried to find contact info before, can you try right now? 
	•	Grace: It was easy to try to find it, but some groups don’t have their info posted. 
	•	Matt: I think it should be obvious how to get recommendations for student groups. 
	•	Serene: I’ve gathered that integration is key and then centralizing and personalizing. A mobile version is important, for sure. As well as making it more user friendly in general. Someone mentioned that freshmen don’t really know about it, so maybe making sure this is pred to freshmen. Do we think people don’t update because it is hard or because nobody uses it? 
	•	Nehaarika: I think it’s a chicken and the egg thing. 
	•	Korri: I thing for the future is to use Wildcat Connection from the start at the Activities Fair. 
	•	Serene: Ideally it could be really useful. Especially when we need to mass message groups, it can be done easily through Wildcat Connection. The SOFO trail was also a useful addition. 
	•	Moira: Wildcat Connection is connected to CSI, SOFO and group advisors. In my experience, what happens is it doesn’t broadcast it to many students. If you’re a small student group putting on an event with short notice, it can cause issues, because then all your advisors want to contact you and it slows everything down via bureaucracy. If you’re a group with limited resources, it can create more work to put it on Wildcat Connection. 
	•	General Order: Student Engagement Stipend
	•	Erik: First I want to talk about how this program came to be. Starting back with last year’s exec board, Ani, Alex, Sofia started discussing how we value student group experience outside the classroom. Questbridge brought up their money matters week and made the conversation more open. Going into our budgeting process last spring, we proposed the Student Leadership Stipend Program. You all approved that, thank you so much. Over the summer, our exec board starting working on that and coordinated with CSI and the Financial Aid Office. Then we created the committee and brought in other student groups - it’s a very diverse group. We have 20 stipends of $500 each. It is meant to help student feel less of a financial stress when committing time to student groups. Anyone who is involved in a student organization is eligible to apply. We are also asking students how the stipend will affect their experience and why their experience will improve their time at Northwestern. There are three essay questions that we look at. We are going to review them by looking at them need-blind. We create a ranked list of who deserves the stipend and then CSI gets their financial aid scores. CSI goes through the list and compiles the information to award the stipends. The recipients find out through CSI and are then given the paperwork to get the money from payroll through work. For most students this should not affect your financial packages. You do not need to be a president or have a particular role. You need to be an undergraduate student. Only the awardees and CSI will know the results. There will be no preferrence to certain groups. The money can be spent on anything and you can pply if you do not have financial aid. 
	•	Vicky: Have you thought about the good neighbor great university scholarships. It takes away work study. Will it affect that? 
	•	Erik: If you have over $6,000 personal income, that when it affects your scholarship. If you’re not working that much, it shouldn’t affect the scholarship. 
	•	General Order: B-Status Funding Primer
	•	Alex: The mission of funding is to foster growth and excellence in the student experience and enriching the campus community. We allowed late applications just to be friendly and then this Saturday we had deliberations. We got 60 applications, we looked at them line by line, and decided whether to fund it or not. We only get about $35,000 a year and have to break that up. We are recommending around $17,000 for this quarter, which needs to be approved by Senate. There might be groups that come to ask for things that are against the guidelines. You can fund whatever you want, but the SGC operates under rules. We promote sustainability (operationally, environmentally, etc), safety, financial independence, successful/recurrent events and cosponsorships. We have standardized amounts which are the maximum amounts we can fund per group. These are determined through precedence. We cannot fund things that are not important for the event, we try to fund things that are essential to the event. Membership fees and transportation to events, we can’t fund, because we can’t fund that for all groups. Next week we will have funding as old business. Look over the funding packet and reach out if anything seems weird. We will go through a random order next week. Our first pass will be a cut round, then an add round, and we’ll keep going until we break even. We have approximately $800 to use for amendments, but there is no need to hit zero, because it will roll over for next week. 
	•	New Business: B-Status Funding Recommendations
	•	Alex: The first column is how much they asked and recommendations what the committee says and the last column is what Senate approves.
	•	Nehaarika: Should we look this all over and make our own recommendations?
	•	Noah:  You could look them over and come with your own recommendations, because that’s the purview of the Senate. But normally the groups will come in if they think they deserve more and we vote on that. You are welcome to try to make an addition if your intuition says you should, but I would suggest talking to me or Alex first. 
	•	New Business: SR1415-02: Support for Increased Northwestern Response to Ebola Crisis
	•	Kenny: They are going to give their presenation, but I’ll introduce them since they haven’t been at senate before. They come the GES and GlobeMed. They think this resolution is important since we have one of the biggest medical schools in the country. 
	•	Michael: This bill came from how universities have remained silent about ebola. In the past universities have has an important voice on health crises. I don’t know if you are familiar with Partners in Health, but they are trying to kick this off at a few universities across this country and Northwestern would be a great place to do this. 
	•	Joey: There is an emphasis on global partnerships in the Northwestern Strategic Plan . So many groups on campus discuss these sorts of issues and are looking for active involvement. This makes sense and there should not be opposition. 
	•	Siddarth: We ask that the university steps up and that personnel who want to go help don’t take a financial hit. We also want their safety prioritized. We want patients in Chicago don’t suffer when their practitioners go abroad. 
	•	Michael: Today was the day we crossed the 5,000 mark for deaths and there is a need for medical professionals. 
	•	Danny: Where do we suggest the monetary expenses come from? 
	•	Michael: It would be continuing benefits, not asking people get more money. That is where working within the departments is important. 
	•	Danny: If they are going on paid leaved, then wouldn’t there need to be people to replace them? 
	•	Michael: That’s why the last point is to work first within the department to fill holes without hiring new people. We aren’t talking about that many people, but I think Northwestern should encourage people - it’ll make a strong statement. 
	•	Moira: Are there Northwestern people there right now? Will this affect them? 
	•	Michael: We actually don’t know. The general vibe we’ve gotten from Feinberg is they are discouraging people to go. We don’t think there are people there right now and this is mainly to encourage people on the fence. 
	•	General Order: Student Group Spotlight: Northwestern Quest Scholars 
	•	Amanda: Hi, I’m Amanda Walsh and I’m the president of Northwestern’s Quest Scholars. We are the largest low income and first generation students advocacy groups in the US. We want to create a supportive community for students on campus and advocate for low income and first generation students on campus. We are trying to become more inclusive. 14% of NU students are low income and 25% of those students are first generation. It is important for us to advocate those students and support other students who care about socio-economic status. We want to make sure that our students are engaged in the NU community and eliminate financial and social barriers. Allies are very important to us, because we do not want to be an exclusive group on campus. We started in the fall of 2010 and we only had about 10 members. Then we had 5 meetings, 3 events, and 16 members. The next year we had about 120 members and became T-Status events. In 2013 we put on Money Matters week and had our first successful exec board transition. Because we are a subset of a national organization we do have a liaison. We also have many committees to get out younger members involved. It is very important for our group to fundraise, since it would be unfair to ask for our members to pay dues. Right now, we have approximately 300 members and about 25 of those consider themselves allies. Last year was when the bulk of our programming started. One of our major activities was out QuestGiving dinner. Many students cannot go home for Thanksgiving break. Last year we had over 130 students and 70+ of those students were not members of Questi. We had Money Matters Week. In the Spring we had our first Senior Farewell dinner. This year we want to have many more events. We had our first general meeting with approximately 47 people in attendance. We have also started a new advocacy committee. Right now we are in a week of stranger dinners where members can have dinner at the apartment of an exec member or an older member. We are also having Thanksgiving 3.0 and expect about 150 people. Our first general meeting is an open event, as is QuestGiving, all career events, our panels and speakers, the advocacy committee firesides, stranger dinners, and fundraisers. The bulk of what our advocacy committee does is working with administrators and other student leaders to make sure we have a campus that is accessible to low income students. Quest has reserved a spot in all leadership trainings on how to make campus more accessible. We are also working on programs that help students pay for theater and greek life. We also have our own peer mentoring program. In the future, we are trying to rebrand with a new name and we want to include more people. Students don’t like to call themselves Quest Scholars if they haven’t received a scholarship from them. We are also trying to do more service in the community. We are also trying to make sure that the advocacy committee is going to be successful. 
	•	Julia: I just want to say I am incredibly impressed and I want to reiterate how great QuestGiving is. Reach out to anyone on the ASG exec board to be part of things that overlap with Quest. 
	•	Moira: Do you do anything for students who don’t have anywhere to stay over breaks? 
	•	Amanda: We generally have older members open their homes internally, but we are trying to work with the Office of Student Enrichment Services to create something larger. 
	•	New Business: SL1415-06: ASG Feedback Working Group
	•	Jaimie: We’ve realized that ASG has a lot of things going on at once, which makes it nearly impossible for us to market everything at once. Some things get a lot of play and others don’t. Student Life and all our committees need a better mechanism to find out what students want. We want to create a working group to figure out how to market our initiatives and to find out what students want. 
	•	Kenny: Where is the necessity for the working group separate from your committees? 
	•	Chris: I think working groups are very effective to institutionalize progress and set aside people to create tangible results. There is a lot going on in the committees, so it can be hard to set aside one thing as a priority.
	•	Jaimie: Chris and I both have leadership styles and certain ways of doing things and the working group allows us to solicit other points of view. 
	•	Chris: Motion to move to old business. 
	•	Isaac: I object. You haven’t given us any compelling reason to move to old business. 
	•	Chris: I’d like to get the group together and there is only so much time in the quarter. And we need to get the bulk of the work done before winter break because of commitments in early January. 
	•	Isaac: My con is that I don’t see how this is critical, since we can get people together to meet informally before this. 
	•	Jaimie: Winter break is a great time for research and we want the committee to be able to hit the ground running. And we really want to do it after getting approval. 
	•	Noah: We will now vote on whether to move this to old business. 
	•	Division. 
	•	13-13-1. In the case of a tie, the motion does not pass. 
	•	New Business:  SL1415-06: Code Changes: I’ll Show You Code Changes 
	•	Alex: Kind of like the t-status stuff we talked about earlier, the SGC guidelines are pretty bad. We did a similar thing with the code last year. There is a lot in the SGC guidelines that has been neglected. The SGC guidelines do not match up with the code and the ASG code take precedence. We’ve changed the formatting, titles that don’t add up, removed student senator selection, removed the title of our advisor, made it so directors need to be approved, and we changed the gendered pronouns. We changed the benefits of groups, removed old resource mentions and added a section about the ASG camera. And then we added a condition that all SAF funded events must specify that they are funded through the SAF, by ASG to increase transparency of where money is going. We also removed all mention of P-status groups which is a relic of the past. It is a status for groups who pop up to support a political candidate and then would dissolve. We thought the CSi recognition process would work well for that group. It has not been used for at least 5 years. 
	•	Alex: I motion to move this to old business. I’m going to be gone next week. I’ve found out I have an interview and need to fly to Phoenix. I trust my GEs for funding, but I would like to be here for this discussion. If it gets put off another week, it will be during sup-funding. 
	•	Second
	•	It passes and we are now moving to old business. 
	•	PQ
	•	Second
	•	Noah: We will now vote on these changes. It passes unanimously. 
	•	Old Business: SL1415-05: A Not So Wild Idea: Closing Loopholes 
	•	Isaac: This just makes it so that any grants under $150 must also be presented before Senate. Right now the Wild Ideas Committee, 0-$150 do not need to be presented to Senate, $150-$500 must be presented, and $500 must be approved by Senate. 
	•	PQ
	•	Noah: We will now vote. It passes unanimously. 
	•	Good of the Order & Announcements
	•	Roll Call and Adjournment

	•	Old Business: A-Status Funding Recommendations
	•	Ani: SAFC met with groups to correct recommendations and insufficient tiers before Senate to speed this process up. You need to vote to approve these amendments.
	•	Girish: Hopefully shouldn't take too long. We'll be going through add and cut rounds- you'd cut for any number of reasons, including if you didn't think the event was good, it doesn't help the NU community, etc.
	•	Girish: Review of Proposed Amendments
	•	Ani: Questions? We can split these up, or vote on them as a whole.
	•	Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- approved. Amendments are now passed.

	•	Ani: we'll do it in the second add round then...
	•	Peace Project
	•	Cory: Motion to add $300 to the Spring Speaker Honorarium
	•	Cory: Last night, Peace Project did great programming like Damien Echols who was wrongly convicted and released.  Not a huge impact to our pool, but can make the difference as to whether or not we can get quality guests like that again.
	•	SAFC Opinion (Girish): Last night's event was co-sponsored with NCDC and we can't really judge co-sponsorships since it's hard to see which group did the most work. We already funded them generously considering the previous allocation
	•	Ani: Questions
	•	Mark: How much did it cost to bring last night's speaker?
	•	Amalia: $10,000
	•	Cory: Point of Clarification- I used last night's speaker as an example of what kinds of speakers Peace Project can bring, not as direct standard for comparing this event to the one from last night.
	•	Ian: Is this funding a co-sponsorship?
	•	Girish: This is a different event- this event is not a co-sponsorship
	•	Ani: Moving into debate on the amendment, now in line for a con
	•	Ian H: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- approved.
	•	Dana: Wait, what happened? Can we do that vote again?
	•	Girish: Ok, you voted to add those funds from the amendment pool.
	•	Tori: Can we reconsider?
	•	Girish: Motion to suspend the rules and reconsider

	•	Amalia: I'm one of the co-chairs of NCDC- would like to get speakers in the $3000-$5000 range- will enhance this event to a greater caliber.
	•	SAFC Opinion (Tori): Event was actually funded at a $10 increase to keep it stable. Hard to tell how well this event went since previous years were co-sponsorships. Not in line for an increase this year, maybe next year
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Mark: Amalia, do you have any further motions this evening
	•	Amalia: No
	•	Sarah: Changes between when you co-sponsored this event and now?
	•	Amalia: FMO just donated money when they were a co-sponsor, last year we pretty much put it on by ourselves
	•	Sarah: Trying to get an idea of change between years?
	•	Amalia: Did it all ourselves following separation from FMO
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Amalia (pro): This range is key to get great speakers- last night's event was great- hope you'll give us these funds to put on a great event.
	•	SAFC (con): Attendance dropped between years- can only consider it when they did it alone. Can only reward changes in attendance- if this group were to put on this event again and then seek funding from us, we would be much more open to this request.

	•	Motoki: Motion to cut $300 to the Spring Speaker Honorarium
	•	Motoki: Before we added to this event, this event was at an 11% increase, this moves it to a 38% increase and the size of this increase is absurd and unsustainable.
	•	Rebecca: We already passed this with this knowledge.
	•	Ani: Yes, this is asked and answered. Motion denied.
	•	Ian: Motion to cut $200 to the Spring Speaker Honorarium
	•	Ian: Will still be well over the growth of the pool- people in this room may want to scale this back a little since they do seem to want to fund the event, though perhaps not this much.
	•	Alex Lower: Can we amend changes? Like could someone have motioned to change the amount?
	•	sgn
	•	Rebecca: Objection
	•	Jesse: Can we vote to not hear this?
	•	Jesse: Yes, following pro/con
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con on the motion
	•	Ian C (pro): doesn't make sense across the board to fund at this level of increase
	•	Jesse (con): Agree in principle- but against this because it's redundant and we already decided this. It's asked and answered.
	•	Hannah (con): originally voted against the increase, but we need to stand by our decision.
	•	Alex Lower (pro): part of the democratic process to consider all options fully
	•	Tori (pro): The facts that we didn't go through pro/con and PQ justifies bringing this back to the floor
	•	Girish: This is a loose funding cycle- usually with tighter rounds, we'd go over the amount we'd have and need to use cut rounds to get back in the black
	•	Cory (con): We're very far in the black- ridiculous to be this up in arms about such a small amount when it'd mean a great deal to peace project.
	•	Rebecca (con): We did PQ it, and a lot of people aren't new. Sorry, but we passed this, it's a second chance to give the opposition an opportunity to shoot this down.
	•	Ian H: Point of Clarification: I called PQ because the floor was dead...
	•	Point of information- SAFC Opinion hasn't happened before
	•	Motoki (pro): Want to consider each case of funding on it's merit, not based on the size of the pool. Should hear the rest of this
	•	Girish (pro): The con that this gives the opposition a chance to respond is a good thing, makes a better decision. And Motoki is right- by giving out more money now, you're doing large disservice to groups in the next cycle.
	•	Jesse (con): we're looking at the pool now, weren't looking at it before.
	•	Moving to a vote on hearing this amendment
	•	Vote- approved. Amendment will be heard on the floor.
	•	Ian: People probably didn't want to give them so much money- we should discuss it again
	•	Ani: Questions on the amendment?
	•	Nouha: What would be the change in the amount of funding given?
	•	Ian: would be giving  additional 100 moving funding for the event from 400 to 500
	•	Senator: What percent increase would that be then?
	•	Would be a 20% increase
	•	SAFC Opinion: We spend hours debating on these amounts- we've allocated groups more now than ever. We had extra money this year to give
	•	Logan (pro): 11% is a high increase- this would signal to other groups to apply for more funds and would drain the spring pool.
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- approved. Funds are cut.

	•	SAFC Opinion: When we look at funding for administrative expenses, we have to treat all student groups the same. Since cameras are available at the library for renting, we chose not to approve this request
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	April: How many cameras available for rent at the library?
	•	Tori: 6 or more
	•	Rebecca: Have you tried to rent a camera previously
	•	Justin: Not tried the library- other means
	•	Noah: What is the procedure and cost associated with obtaining a camera?
	•	Tori: Only fee involved with the process is if you're late in returning it
	•	Ian H: Is this the cycle when we'd usually fund this sort of thing?
	•	Tori: Supplemental is usually the cycle we use to fund capital improvements
	•	Girish: this is when we would fund this
	•	Sofia: Average demand for these cameras?
	•	Tori: I work in the library- it varies. Most have their own cameras- they're rarely all checked out and come out fairly quickly
	•	Evan: Is it usually groups that check these out?
	•	Tori: we've never funded cameras or camcorders since I've been here
	•	Ian H: Reservation system for cameras?
	•	Can reserve cameras up to a month in advance and can extend duration of rental
	•	Ani: Pro/con for this amendment
	•	Ian C (con): Sounds like there are sufficient resources in the library, we don't need to fund this.
	•	Mike: Would be more interested in funding this as an investment to all students, rather than one group
	•	Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- fails. Funds are not allocated.

	•	Kaibigan

	•	SAFC: Thanks for the shortest funding cycle ever!

III. New Business: SL1213-13: Services Committee and Vice President Code Reform
	•	Noah: It's Services- watch out!
	•	Noah: This legislation makes Services VP position have similar structure to every other position on exec and brings the code in line with current practices
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Hannah: Reasons for why the code was messed up?
	•	Brad: Was the newest position on the executive board- in the past, each VP would manage their own services. When this position was created, the leadership at the time didn’t want this new position to step on everyone's toes, so they put a lot of restriction on the position. We knew that bringing this before you guys was a risk, because if you vote this down we'll actually have to start following the guidelines the way they are now. The current procedure hasn't been followed because it's incredibly unproductive and would definitely slow progress.
	•	Ian: Motion to move this to old business
	•	Ian: Really being terrible with the code in this state- Rules would've corrected it through code review if it wasn't so large.
	•	Ani: Moving to pro/con on moving this to old business
	•	Jane (con): should have David here to speak on this
	•	Hannah (con): changing the code is significant- should have the person affected by this here
	•	Rebecca (pro): breaking the code is more significant, we need to make this change now.
	•	Noah (pro): we're acting in violation of the code, successfully so. David is fine with this passing through old business.
	•	Ian H (con): didn't get a chance to read this closely, wanted to focus on funding...
	•	Ani: Not an excuse
	•	Jane (con): Big code change, we should consider this further.
	•	Rebecca (pro): how long will "being a new senator" be an excuse?
	•	Ian (pro): this code change is de facto- we need to have our official documents in line
	•	Sarah (con): Need time to look at this and make sure we can look at this to ensure it'll be successful
	•	Ani: In line for a vote on moving this to old business
	•	Vote- division
	•	Yea: 22
	•	Nay: 13
	•	Abstentions: 2
	•	Approved- legislation is now old business.
	•	Noah: Code as it is makes it so exec has to approve everything we do. Would be incredibly inefficient.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Senator: Are we sure that it isn't best to leave the code as it is and start voting on what projects Services takes on?
	•	Brad: Not in current practices to vote on everything the services committee does
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con
	•	Brad (pro): Services VP is the second newest exec position- when the position was proposed, exec was afraid that services would step on the toes of other VPs territory- wanted to make sure that the Services VP didn't overstep their bounds- wanted to prevent a new position from dominating the exec board. Would be a major waste to the exec boards time to approve every service. David knew he was taking a risk in bringing this to the floor- we as exec fully support this legislation.
	•	Motoki: Would you say that the Services committee has overstepped their bounds in the past couple years?
	•	Brad: consulted with academics and student life whenever that's happened.
	•	Alex Lower: Doesn't this remove accountability?
	•	Brad: Services is currently accountable to the entire exec board, which is shared by no other exec position
	•	Motoki: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- approved unanimously. Code is amended.

Senate Adjourned



Northwestern University
Associated Student Government
Meeting of the Senate
November, 19, 2014

	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	Wild Ideas Fund Request: Lambda Upsilon Lambda and brought in a professor to speak about Colombia. The money largely went to food to heighten the event. The turnout was great with 40 people. 
	•	General Order: A-Status Funding Primer/B-Status Funding Reminder
	•	Old  Business: B-Status Funding Recommendations
	•	Cut round, groups in a random order. 
	•	Add round, groups in a random order. 
	•	Moira: Motion to add a line item for public storage for SJP. There was a misunderstanding from the student group. The GE for the student group was taking the quarter off, so Alex temporarily took over those duties. SJP didn’t understand until after the funding applications that public storage was possible for their group. They need public storage because they have a lot of things like a wall that needs to be housed and also SJP’s publicity materials have been getting vandalized, so they need a safe space. 
	•	SGC: SGC supports that. When they asked we weren’t sure if we were funding public storage and SJP interpreted as public storage was not possible. We want to rectify that mistake. 
	•	PQ
	•	Vote: Passes. 
	•	Moira: I motion to add $150 dollars to that line item, but that is my understanding for it as a standardized amount. 
	•	SGC: It’s not standardized, but that is the amount we gave other groups. 
	•	PQ
	•	Vote: Passes. 
	•	SGC: Motion to add. Would like to add $40 to ribbons, $20 to buttons and $25 to posters. We thought the ribbons were marketing, but we realized they are actually reusable, so they are a capital campaign. The buttons are marketing, so we want to give them $25. The posters are reusable also, so that is a capital improvement. 
	•	PQ
	•	Vote: Passes. 
	•	Issac: Motion to eliminate the last cut round. 
	•	Vote: Passes.

	•	Moira: Motion to propose emergency legislation. Last night Students for Justice in Palestine hung up a banner and this morning it had been cut down and is missing. This resolution asks ASG to condemn the theft of the banner and promote a safe community for student groups and to protect free speech. It is emergency legislation because it happened last night and I think it is important to respond to injustice quickly. 
	•	Noah: We will now vote. Passes. 
New Business: Allowing a Palestinian Voice on Campus
	•	Moira: We are the four authors of this legislation and there are also a few other sponsors. I’ll read a few of the most important lines. The banner read: “More than 5.3 million Palestinians have been forced out of their homes by the state of Israel since its creation,” and included citation to the United Nations Works and Relief Agency. It said that and SJP in the corner. It was gone by 8am today with no signs of it being blown away - the rope had clearly been cut with a blade. This constitutes theft of property and violates SJP’s right to free speech on campus. It threatens the ability of students and political groups to feel safe when continuing their work. 
	•	Ruba: We are basically asking ASG to condemn this violation of free speech. We’d like to point out this doesn’t end with SJP. That is why it is emergency legislation, but we think this will allow students to feel more comfortable speaking out. Additionally, the banner was part of a larger campaign. 
	•	Alec: Do you intend to move this to old business? 
	•	Ruba: No
	•	Daniel: Was anything else on the banner?
	•	Black and white text, a link, and the quote. 
	•	Ruba: Motion to move this to old business. 
	•	Noah: Seeing no objections we will vote. Passes. We will see this at the end of the agenda.
	•	New Business: A-Status Funding
	•	Eliza: This is student’s money and we allocate with that in mind. It is an application and interview process. The groups submit an application with their AE and go over it with them. Then it goes to the committee, we meet with the groups. We fund based on how the event has gone, how contracts are handled, how they interact with their AE, etc. there are many factors to consider. SAFC spends a lot of time on these recommendations, so please consider them. Just as SGC has standards, SAFC has even more extensive standards. 
	•	Isaac: SASA funding, one of the stated reasons is lack of event success. I thought the event went from 30 to 300 people. Can you define lack of event success?
	•	Eliza: That event was incredibly successful, but there were some behind the scenes things that determined SAFC’s decision. 
	•	New Business: SL1415-06: Transferring SOFO Responsibility
	•	Erik: A lot of the SOFO rules are more in line with the Chief of Staff position. It is a time suck and keeps me from doing a lot of the stuff I was elected to do. I would like to move this to old business tonight since it is internal management and will make our transition smoother. 
	•	Jonathan: How will this affect the Chief of Staff? 
	•	Erik: It is an addition to their responsibilities. Right now they chair a bunch of committees and run the office, so they are already working closely with all these people. It shouldn’t be too much additional work and I’ll definitely help during the transition. 
	•	Nehaarika: Is there anything in the code that delineates this? 
	•	Erik: It is specifically stated in the code that the EVP handles the finances. 
	•	Grace: Can you speak to our current Chief of Staff’s qualifications? 
	•	Erik: Andrew served on the SAFC and is very aware of SOFO and audit trails. 
	•	Erik: Motion to move to old business. 
	•	Noah: Passes. We are going to discuss this now, because Erik needs to leave. 
	•	PQ
	•	Noah: Seeing no objections. Passes unanimously. 
	•	New Business: SR1415-03: Addressing Socioeconomic Status at Northwestern (see: Presentation) 
	•	Isaac: Motion to moving it to the end of new business. Amanda Walsh who is the president of Quest Scholars is currently in class and should not be out until 8:30 at the earliest. 
	•	Noah: No objections. Passes unanimously. 
	•	New Business: SR1415-04 Flyering: Not So Fly
	•	Christina: I’m here with members of the sustainability committee. We have been having conversations about ground flyering within exec and have decided that it is not a great way of advertising. We want to reduce ground flyering in general and want to start with the exec board. 
	•	Lindsey: We found that ground flyering is really wasteful. There are so many flyers, after it rains you can’t use it, facilities management needs to clean it up and they also have to use power washers to do so, which wastes water. In the future we hope to get rid of it entirely. 
	•	Alec: This legislation says we support the exec board’s decision to move away from this form and that we want other groups to do so. 
	•	Nikki: ASG, like it has before, is going to serve as a pilot project. 
	•	Johnny: Does the rule oblige ASG committees and caucuses not to flyer? 
	•	Alec: It’s not binding, but the exec board has come to that decision. 
	•	Nehaarika: When was that decision made? 
	•	Christina: It wasn’t published, but we’ve talked about it multiple times. 
	•	Isaac: Why isn’t this legislation? 
	•	Alec: They already did this, so we are just supporting them. 
	•	Grace: Are you thinking of making this legislation in the future? 
	•	Lindsey: In the future we want to come up with a good alternative. In the future, we would like to get it banned. 
	•	Jake: Have you thought about making it legislation, because groups get their funding from ASG?
	•	Alec: We don’t think we’re at that point yet, because we want to do research for an alternative to not hurt student groups. 

	•	Ronak: Motion to introduce emergency legislation. I don’t know if you read the daily article about Northwestern’s policy on marijuana for Ski Trip. Colorado has legalized marijuana and Northwestern says students will be held accountable as if they were in Illinois. It is emergency legislation so that we can vote on it next Senate before Ski Trip. 
	•	Isaac: Is it a resolution? 
	•	Ronak: Yes it is a resolution. 
	•	Jonathan: I don’t see why this needs to be emergency legislation. Why do we need to respond to this policy?
	•	The real problem with this is that if you are a 21 year old in Colorado who want to use cannabis legally, it pushes students to more dangerous substances. The idea is that this student policy is pushing students to use more dangerous substances. 
	•	PQ
	•	Passes, one nay vote. 
	•	Noah: I’m stepping down to speak about it
	•	Daniel: Hi, i’m the prez of SSDP. Our goal is that drug use is an individual right, and that in light of that instead of abstinence only, we should use education and counseling to reduce the dangers. this allows students who are over 21 can follow the law and not face punitive punishments from the university. cannabis is a safer alternative to alcohol, and if you are 21 on ski trip and want to use a safer alternative you should be able to do so. also allow the university to tell the students what their policy is. universities have to comply with federal drug laws to recieve funding. but there are 100 medical amnesty acts allowing students to use medical marijuana, without losing federal funding. if we allow students to use cannabis
	•	Noah: why i wanted to come on as a sponsor is that i want the adminsitration to be held accountble when their policies don’t match the student conduct handbook. the fact of the matter is that weed is legal in CO, and it’s patronizing and hypocriical for the administration to hold students accountable.
	•	Isaac: When was this policy announced by the uni?
	•	Dan: This is a continuation of university policy. 
	•	Jonathan: do you think that northwestern policy will cause students to smoke less on ski trip, and if not, why is this resolution necessary?
	•	Dan: it will affect the # of students
	•	Noah: it’s not about students smoking, its about making sure that the adminsitration is held accountable 
	•	*discussion on sponsoring emergency legislation*
	•	Kenny: which part of the administration are we sending this to?
	•	Dan: Student Conduct
	•	Noah: the idea is to demonstrate widespread student support to what we see as a grievance
	•	Isaac: are you content to see this seen next senate?
	•	Noah: i was hoping to push this to old business
	•	Its a thing that if you are over 21 you can’t be around underage drinkers?
	•	that’s only a university rule relating to dorms
	•	Clarification: university policy is that when you are accepted to northwestern, you sign an agreement that you will uphold this set of standards (i.e. the handboook). whether you are here or 100 miles away, you are expected to follow the handbook. Flipside: student conduct is not actively looking for violators. 
	•	Motion to move to old business; seconded
	•	Noah: it is important to move this to old business ...
	•	Moves to old business!
	•	The questioning period counts as a pro
	•	Jonathan: when students are on a school-sponsored event, they represnt northwestern. i dont feel this is an issue we should harp the administration on. if students want to smoke, they don’t care about administration policy.
	•	Isaack: Pro. We’re not going to change anyone’s mind on marijana policy. PQ.
	•	Obections.
	•	Withdrawn.
	•	Danny: Pro. I think it is a high priority. it is a student safety priority. students will decide whetehr they want to smoke pot or not, but if there are school sanctions students will use the more dangerous alternative (alcohol).
	•	Con: nobody has presented to me adequate evidence that students will find this policy relevant to their decision to use marijana. 
	•	Pro: i feel the issue of whether or not they want to do it should take a back burner to the decision that whether or not they are following 
	•	Moira: it would be beneficial to err on the side of protecting students against being punished for doing something that is legal. Promote safety of stuents
	•	Noah: PQ; seconded
	•	Vote: 
	•	That motion passes. One Nay, several abstentions
	•	New Business: SL1415-08 Off-Campus Elections
	•	Matt: Back in the spring we formed a working group to look at the Off Campus Senator election process and improve what has been a neglected caucus. We have come up with this plan to improve the process. The election cycle will be matched with the presidential election in the spring. Off campus residents vote in significant numbers in the election, so we think it would improve voter turnout. 
	•	Isaac: Are we worried this will disenfranchise a lot of people who will be living off campus and discourage seniors from running?
	•	Ronak: We think it is the best way to enfranchise people? 
	•	Sam: Would it be possible to vote for just one or the other? 
	•	The is to be determined. 
	•	Why ask for 25 signatures? 
	•	We thought that was the number we needed. 
	•	Nehaarika: Does this mean you need to vote for president to vote for your senator? 
	•	It depends on how the ballot is made, but most likely not. 

New Business: SR1415-03: Addressing Socioeconomic Status at Northwestern (see: Presentation) 
	•	Presented. Isaac does not know how to use a PC. 
	•	Ross: Can you ask about the last be it resolved and why it is necessary? 
	•	Austin: Isaac, Amanda and I are working with a faculty group to try to increase the number of lower income students. We want to see pell grants increase. We are currently around 16% and we want to get to 20% by 2020. Morty did recently say he wanted to see the students on pell grants increase in possibly a shorter time frame. 
	•	Amanda: Some of the California schools that Northwestern considers peer institutions are at over 30%. 
	•	Isaac: We also want the university to set objectives and create a goal. 
	•	What feedback have you gotten so far from the library? 
	•	Amanda: I think the conversations we have has indicated that it would be a financial burden. But they are willing to publicize further the services they have right now. 
	•	Anna: I will add that they are really supportive of their online system and the interlibrary loans, it’s just a financial issue right now. 
	•	Moira: The negative score northwestern got, why do you think they got it? 
	•	Isaac: Part of it is the pure statistic and part of it is the average financial aid people get. Northwestern has a startling high expectations for families to pay. 
	•	Nehaarika: Can you explain why you decided to make this a resolution? And why the points are all so specific? 
	•	Austin: We do not have authority over the university decisions. 
	•	Isaac: We also wanted to be specific, because we want the document to be guiding and not just a general “ASG wants diversity!” claim. 
	•	Amanda: I also think passing this is important, because it gives us weight when going to administrators. This resolution also brings together what groups are all doing separately, so it creates a united front. 
	•	Motion to move to old business. 
	•	Passes. 
	•	Old  Business: SR1415-02: Support for Increased Northwestern Response to Ebola Crisis
	•	I don’t really have anything new to add. We just want to get this passed so we can approach the university. 
	•	PQ
	•	Passes. 
	•	Old  Business: SL1415-06: ASG Feedback Working Group
	•	Jaimie: Hi! We are back trying to make our communication group into an actual working group. It will look at how we communicate and put our message forward. 
	•	PQ
	•	Passes unanimously. 
	•	Old Business:  SL1415-09: Wild Ideas: Brady Five Screening of the Homestretch
	•	It is for $700. $500 for rights and $200 for a speaker. The Brady Five are screening a movie called the Homestretch. It is about students who are homeless and attending Chicago Public Schools. They initially asked for a lot more, but the bare minimum they need is $500. They are in the process of getting funding from other people. They are also doing a great time on marketing and are doing PR with related groups. 
	•	PQ
	•	Passes unanimously. 
Old Business: Allowing a Palestinian Voice on Campus
	•	Moira: Hopefully you have gotten more of a chance to look through the wording of the legislation. Another reason I think it is important for us to pass this is this kind of thing is not an anomaly for SJP. It is almost expensive that this would happen to our materials and it is unfortunate that a student groups has to deal with expecting their materials to be ruined. When we painted the rock it was painted over and we have seen flyers get taken down. No student group should have to deal with that on campus. For the sake of personal safety of the number and the right of all student groups to share political opinions, it is important to pass this. 
	•	Daniel: Can you speak to some more of the vandalism that has occured? 
	•	Sara: The rock last year, many of our fliers have been taken down. This banner along wiht supplementary materials that were put up last night at 7:30 pm. 
	•	Daniel: Have you ever been able to identify individuals? 
	•	Moira: With the exception of times we have seen people throw stuff away, no. With the banner there is no camera, it was in the middle of the night, no one saw it - we couldn’t say who did it. 
	•	Nehaarika: Are you taking any measures to actually stop the measures?
	•	-: We filled out RespectNU twice last year and filed a police report for what happened last night. 
	•	Moira: It’s not just one person, it’s an overall climate where it is acceptable. Voicing public condemnation of this activity is important part. 
	•	Grace: How would you use this resolution to further your cause of promoting free speech? 
	•	Ruba: It is not so much for our purposes. This resolution would stand more as a symbol to the rest of campus that we do not support acts like this as a student body. 
	•	Ariel: On behalf of Hillel I want to strongly condemn the actions that were taken last night. My only reservation about the legislation is that it states that “disrespects the 5.3 million individuals displaced from their homes by the State of Israel” and this would cause ASG to say this as fact. I think this line deviates from the purpose of this legislation. 
	•	Moira: The fact that was on the banner was not a random act, so it was clearly a politically motivated attack and against that fact. The 5.3 million statistic, that is the number of people who were refugees in 48 and all the people who have been displaced within the country. It is not a disputable fact and is not a political statement. Members of SJP have family who are part of that statistic and they feel targeted about that statistic. 
	•	Ariel: I get that, but the purpose of the legislation is not to confirm the fact or not, but to condemn the actions taken last night. 
	•	Jonathan: Motion to amend. I motion to take away the line: disrespects the 5.3 million individuals displaced from their homes by the State of Israel, which includes members of Northwestern families . It is inaccurate.  We really need to focus on what the resolution is saying, which is about condemning the act of violating free speech on campus. Without this line, all parties would be in support of this. 
	•	Ruba: This act was targeting my identity as a descendant and a Palestinian. 
	•	Motion to amend. I propose that we only strike the 5.3 figure. We are not looking to make a political statement and I don’t think there is a question that Israel has displaced families. 
	•	Moira: The 5.3 statistic is from the UN. One of us could provide the link if you need us to. It is a fact. I think that this issue is a political issue, because taking down the banner was a political act. By including the reason why it was taken down, we are not making it unnecessarily political. 
	•	Daniel: Are agree that we are doing this to condemn the act, so publicizing why it was an issue in the first place is 
	•	Motion to suspend the rules. 
	•	Passes. 
	•	Amendments: 
	•	disrespects the 5.3 million individuals displaced from their homes by the State of Israel , which includes members of Northwestern families
	•	disrespects the 5.3 million individuals displaced from their homes by the State of Israel , which includes members of Northwestern families
	•	disrespects the 5.3 million (according to the UNRWA) individuals displaced from their homes by the State of Israel, which includes members of Northwestern families
	•	disrespects the 5.3 million individuals displaced from their homes by the State of Israel, which includes members of Northwestern families
	•	Jonathan: The document says 750,000 actual refugees, the rest are descendant and other groups. 
	•	Ronak: I see the fact but without the words “by the State of Israel”.
	•	Isaac: I really think that the citation is the right way to go, because it says where the number is coming from. 
	•	Serene: For the 5.3 million, the reason this is so confusing is that the refugees are so fragmented purposefully. I think it is important to include that clause and it is important to include the state of Israel. To say that they were displaced and not to say why or who. It was the State of Israel, that is indisputable. We can have the conversation about whether the should have been displaced elsewhere. 
	•	Alec: The refugees are them and their descendants. I think the language in the misleading, because 4 million were not physically moved. We need to get back to what the bill is about. 
	•	Matt: I don’t think that it matters what the number is. Getting hung up on this statement, this is not the point of this. We should have this dialogue separately. I think we should get rid of the whole statement. We should keep everything apolitical and maintain the point of free speech. 
	•	Serene: I’m hearing talk about political versus not political, but free speech is political. The number is pedantic, so I don’t think it’s that big of a deal to get rid of it. This is political and one sided, because any time SJP or related people do this, this kind of thing happens. Fliers happen all the time, it only happen to pro-Palestine voices. 
	•	Moira: As the authors and the sponsors we would be okay with getting rid of the numbers or including the citation. Because it does not give ASG support, but just says what the UN says. 
	•	Noah: We will now move to vote via preferential voting.  
	•	Motion to return to the rules. 
	•	Passes.
	•	Motion to extend Senate by 30 minutes. 
	•	Passes.
	•	Motion: to change it to “disrespects Palestinian identity and expression on campus”
	•	No objections. Passes. 
	•	PQ. 
	•	Voting on the bill as a whole. 
	•	Passes. 

Old Business: SR1415-03: Addressing Socioeconomic Status at Northwestern (see: Presentation) 
	•	Alec: With the last be it resolved, what do you mean by that and how do you envision that going forward? 
	•	Amanda: Essentially this is about living up to the reputation of our peer institutions. And because this is a resolution it does not compel the university to do anything, not that we could. 
	•	Ross: Motion to amend. I want it to read that: “Be it further resolved, that the undergraduate student body calls on the administration to use the percentage of undergraduate students on Pell Grants as one metric of success to be evaluated in 2020 at the latest.” Because I am against any quotas. 
	•	Isaac: This isn’t a quota, but just trying to increase our yield. This is not about letting people in, because admissions is need blind. It is more that Northwestern should make a greater attempt to get them to come here. I think it is important to put a hard number here and say as a student body that we want it to be higher and that this is the latest date it would be acceptable. 
	•	Ronak: Why 20%?
	•	Amanda: Because from an admissions standpoint and the financial burden of the university, it makes sense. It makes tangible sense to the University. 
	•	Austin: Everything in this has been discussed, so I like the idea of 20% or more. 
	•	Alec: Would you be open to an amendment clarifying the clause as it for yield and not admission?
	•	Isaac: No. 
	•	Grace: Motion to amend and add “or greater” after 20%. 
	•	PQ
	•	Passes. 
	•	We are now in discussion on this amendment. 
	•	PQ
	•	Passes unanimously. 
	•	We are now in discussion of the resolution as a whole. 
	•	Motion: I would like to add “while keeping admissions need-blind” at the end of the clause. 
	•	We are now in discussion of the resolution as a whole. 
	•	PQ
	•	Passes unanimously. 
	•	Good of the Order & Announcements
	•	Roll Call and Adjournment
ASG Senate Minutes

	•	Hannah: Clarify spiciness level of dishes please
	•	Sofia: Line needs to be better organized so that traffic isn’t obstructed

	•	Girish: SAFC allocates 1.2 million of SAF, but also work as Account Executives to oversee any money allocated. Really want to make it an advisory role for groups. 5 hrs a week commitment, 20-30 hrs during funding weeks.
	•	Girish: Will open the floor for nominations, give speeches, recommendations, vote, etc.
	•	Paul (question): are we doing preferential voting?
	•	Ani: Couldn't work out how to do it with 3 positions for a board well enough to utilize it.
	•	Girish: When the time comes, I plan to motion to suspend the rules and revert back to the old system of voting, just for now.
	•	Motoki (question): So are we considering majorities?
	•	Ani: Well we… just… no. We'll talk about this more going forward with Ian...
	•	Ani: Opening the floor for nominations of non-senators for SAFC
	•	Senator: I nominate Amrit
	•	Amrit: I accept
	•	X: I nominate Jason Arnold
	•	Jason: I accept
	•	Girish: I nominate Phillip Halsted
	•	Phillip: I accept
	•	X: I nominate Siddiq
	•	Siddiq: I accept
	•	X: I nominate Faique
	•	Faique: I accept
	•	Girish: I nominate Melody
	•	Melody: I accept
	•	Ani: Introduce yourselves- name, major and why you want to be on the SAFC.
	•	Amrit: I'm an Econ/Math major. I'm on the board right now, running for reelection. I've been on for a quarter and have gotten to know the board. We just had one of our most successful supplementary funding cycles ever. Members of the SAFC should bring diversity to the board and I think I do. I think you guys can give me an opportunity to serve for another year
	•	Jason: I'm a BME major, I was appointed in the spring- I have the experience of being on the board for a quarter, really passionate about student groups. Really want to be able to help student groups
	•	Phillip: I'm econ/psych double major. Have experience in this field, though haven't been on the board before , but have experience since my parents work with accounting stuff. Captain of debate team in HS and member of NU debate, my experience
	•	Siddiq: One of the older AE's- been through the supplementary funding cycle and the spring funding cycle. Worked with a lot of groups of all types. It's a huge time commitment, but it's great to work with so many groups and would love to bring that advisory role to the board
	•	Faique: Haven't really joined any other leadership experiences, really want to devote my time to this. Part of project ARK to give bracelets to people- has given me lots of experience. Have communication skills from these projects- also have experience from HS, not sure if that's relevant anymore… as a freshman, have lots of time to commit to the position.
	•	Melody: I'm a freshmen as an econ/political science major. I'm reliable, dedicated and creative. Being a freshman could be a disadvantage, but I could be a benefit by providing new perspective to committee. I also have a MENU/stats background and was a treasurer for my HS's MUN, where I got experience - really want to be on the board to know more NU student leaders and help student groups. Really love planning events and organizing activities.
	•	Ani: Opening the floor for questions
	•	Tori: What do you perceive to be the most important responsibility of an AE?
	•	Amrit: Getting to know your groups really well and put on the best events possible and making sure groups get the help they need
	•	Jason: Working with student groups is most important and being a resource to them. We want to encourage groups to work together through the SAFC
	•	Phillip: Have to be there with the groups and need to be very responsible with our allocations to ensure they're fair
	•	Siddiq: Being amiable and open- many groups might not ask for info if they're not comfortable, be open and encouraging.
	•	Faique: Make sure funding's being used properly and really it's about communication with the groups
	•	Melody: With a limited budget, we need to maximize the activities groups put on for groups to be successful.
	•	Amanda: Other time commitments?
	•	Jason: I have school, obviously, but also have GlobeMed, both of which aren't huge time commitments
	•	Phillip: Just NU debate and with only 2 tournaments, should have time to commit to the position
	•	Siddiq: Slam Society might be only other commitment, been on SAFC for a while, and I've been able to manage it.
	•	Faique: Lots of time to dedicate to groups since I haven't joined other activities
	•	Melody: Only have 3 courses technically, so have plenty of free time to commit
	•	Amrit: Been to every SAFC meeting, but also a member of ISBE and work at NUIT. I can balance it all
	•	Jane: Are any of you currently affiliated with any groups SAFC works with?
	•	Melody: Don't think so
	•	Faique:
	•	Siddiq:
	•	Phillip: Don't, and want to use the position to get to know the groups.
	•	Jason: No direct involvement, though I do still go to events.
	•	Amrit: no connections to those groups… probably.
	•	Girish: What do you see as the biggest challenge facing students groups and how can ASG/SAFC address it?
	•	Faique: Hard to address because I'm a freshman, but can give more direction to groups.
	•	Siddiq: Lot of student groups- when groups collaborate, they learn things about each other, so I would encourage that
	•	Phillip: would want to help more with recognition and the process that groups go through to achieve it
	•	Jason: want to bring a more diverse crowd to student group events, benefits the whole community
	•	Amrit: Information exists, but letting groups know about this info. Working on things like wildcat connection and letting students know about groups that align with their interests
	•	Melody: Funding is a big problem. SAFC only serves top groups, other groups are left out
	•	Motoki: Last time you were logged onto gchat?
	•	Ani: Gonna rephrase that- general electronic availability?
	•	Siddiq: I own a cell phone… laptop has email open, will hear notification, usually find out where student groups chill and help them there. Can also get a pager
	•	Phillip: Have a cell phone, check email after every class and always checking on stuff
	•	Jason: We're all pretty accessible. I try to work with CSA to arrange meeting times conveniently and forward on if I can't answer it
	•	Amrit: have an iphone + snapchat
	•	Melody: I have cell phone, laptop and I stay up late
	•	Faique: Stay on gmail too much- check facebook a lot
	•	Alex Lower: Motion to end question period
	•	Ani: Moving into a discussion/endorsement period.
	•	X: Amrit is my AE, he's super organized and responsible, he always keeps me on track. He's super personable and consistent
	•	X: Support Amrit, Jason, Siddiq- they've done a great job. Siddiq has been on for a long time which is important. The other two newer members have learned a lot and gained experience from going through a funding cycle
	•	X (question): how much turnover is appropriate?
	•	Girish: Turnover isn't valuable in and of itself, experience is most important
	•	X: Want to endorse Jason. Best person I've worked with- responds to my emails within 10 minutes and signs stuff within a day. Got things done for me- he keeps me on my toes. He does so much stuff, and he's super knowledgeable.
	•	X: Want to endorse Siddiq- he encourages everyone around him to go to student group events. He fosters a sense of community
	•	X: Want to endorse Phillip- objectively, he brings professionalism and passion to the position.
	•	X: Want to endorse Siddiq, Faique & Jason- Siddiq is really personable and great at being hands-on with groups. Faique has excitement of a freshman pivotal to getting involved with SAFC. Jason's answers were great though I don't know him.
	•	X: Want to endorse Siddiq, he's the most friendly person I know at NU and he's very passionate about ASG.
	•	X: Speak on behalf of Jason- his answers demonstrated professionalism and commitment to student groups
	•	X: First want to speak on behalf of Amrit. He deserves a full year since he was elected already by Senate. He's been very visible when I have questions. Melody and Faique had a lot of merit in their answers. Siddiq is someone I worked with and he is very committed to confidentiality and faithfulness.
	•	X: Want to endorse Faique and Siddiq- Faique founded the ARK group he mentioned- great at lots of things. Siddiq is an amazing person and good candidate
	•	X: Faique's position as a freshman gives him time to really be a part of the board. He's also really open
	•	Girish: Motion to suspend the rules and move back to non-preferential voting
	•	Vote- approved. Plurality voting reinstated.
	•	Ani: Let it be known that Mike Morgan is a Senator
	•	May circle as many confidences as you want, but only three preferences. Don't need to include last names - no conflicting first names.
	•	Ani: We're now going to move to SAFC Senator elections! Three spots for anyone who has ever served as a Senator or who is currently a Senator
	•	Alex: I nominate Lydia Gao
	•	Lydia: I accept.
	•	X: I nominate Tori
	•	Tori: I accept.
	•	Siddiq: I nominate William
	•	William: I accept.
	•	X: I nominate Sean
	•	Sean: I accept.
	•	X: I nominate Sofia
	•	Sofia: I accept.
	•	Ani: Nominations are now closed for Senator election, moving to introductions and question period
	•	Lydia: Junior, wants to help student groups to grow by helping to provide them with the funds they need.  Northwestern needs more sense of community.  Can be created through student groups.  Solid background in finance - plans on a career in finance.  Reads WSG.  Internships at securities firms.  SAFC invests in projects efficiently in order to generate the maximum return.
	•	Tori: Junior, been on the board since spring of 2011.  Saw SAFC as the best opportunity to work with student groups across campus.  Encouraging co-sponsorships.  Learned the guidelines, a lot of rules to know.  It's less about finance and more about knowing how to deal with SOFO.  Liaison between all that and making sure that the groups put on the best events they can.
	•	William: Junior, been on the board for a year.  Didn't know what SAFC was- like to make difference at Northwestern, great experience to be a part of that and want to rejoin SAFC to make it better
	•	Sean: RTVF/Econ major, want to put my skills to use- incredible use to student groups. Really want to get involved. There do need to be strict guidelines, but with some measure of fluidity. I love working as a liaison and developing external relationships.
	•	Sofia: Bio/Global studies major. Never lived on campus, there's never enough attention paid to the student leaders on this campus for the resources they make available. My background supplements the position since a lot goes into planning an event and attending meetings. I've worked with administration and higher-ups
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Girish: Other Commitments?
	•	Lydia: not involved with other exec boards, but attend the events of various groups. Have a lot of time on my hands, will focus much of my attention on SAFC.
	•	Tori: Currently a Senator and involved with A&O, CASE and TriDelt. May seem like a lot, but I haven't missed a SAFC meeting. I understand what's needed of an AE through this experience, no conflict of interest.
	•	Willian: Just involved with ISBE, have lots of time.
	•	Sean: Actively involved with my fraternity, in A&O, on dean's advisory council- all of these positions let me be a liaison to groups and gives me that experience.
	•	Sofia: On two ASG communities, but I enjoy doing them. It's like my social life.
	•	Alex Lower: Work or club experience that's relevant to being a SAFC AE?
	•	Tori: Had to produce a concert- have relationships with CSI and administration. Been through multiple funding cycles. CASE has let me work with lots of different types of groups
	•	William: VP of Phi Alpha Delta, VP of my hall, gave me experience with seeing problems and ways to address them within organizations.
	•	Sean: I'm a liaison for Dance Marathon, correspondent for my fraternity and a member of the SoC advisory council… also on A&O. Learned to develop relationships between groups and finding the division between the professional and personal relationships.
	•	Sofia: Serve on a McSA, serves as liaison to SASA and PARS- lets me see the differences in programming. Lets me see spectrum of groups and ideas.
	•	Lydia: Worked closely with ASG freshman year. Worked with Claire Lew. Was also on the Crew team. Past experiences have taught me to listen to those I work with
	•	Girish: Biggest problem or challenge to student groups that SAFC/ASG can address?
	•	William: Dealing with SOFO- lots of opportunities to reform the system
	•	Sean: Would say the same thing- hearing about SAFC through various channels has allowed me to see a lot of problems with the SAFC- like transparency, for example. I would be as transparent as possible
	•	Sofia: Lots of issues- basic ones and more advanced ones, like when to hold events that we should all acknowledge
	•	Lydia: Publicity- lots of students hear about events after the fact. We can help marketing and publicity efforts. Maybe we can improve wildcat connection
	•	Tori: Miscommunication between AE's and advisors- both are telling people two different things. You also lose the institutional knowledge as people graduate and that information needs to be preserved.
	•	Ani: Moving into the recommendation/endorsement period
	•	X: Want to endorse Sofia- she has a valuable type of experience in working with groups.
	•	X: Also want to endorse Sofia- I've known her as a community member. She's badass and asks the best questions. She's been invaluable and wants to help everybody and getting answers from both sides of every debate
	•	X: Want to endorse Sean and Lydia- Sean's answers were good and Lydia was one of the first people in ASG to come forward to me with a grievance. Also, I know she worked with a professional company and she has a great background with student groups.
	•	X: Would like to endorse Sofia and Tori- Sofia's very active in everything's she's involved in. Tori's fantastic as always. Sean was also impressive
	•	X: Endorse Sofia- she's great at producing effective collaborations. Tori has done a great job with all of our events and she's been great.
	•	X: Endorse Sofia- worked with her, she's one of the ones talking the most and has a big passion for the position and making sure students are active.
	•	X: Want to endorse Tori and Sofia- Tori's previous experience and her answers were extraordinary. I've worked with Sofia. She has a serious care about student groups at Northwestern.
	•	X: Want to endorse Sean, he loves Northwestern more than most- seems like a natural role for him.
	•	X: Want to endorse Lydia- she's a hard worker and devotes herself to whatever she takes on
	•	X: Tori and William's experience is invaluable- Sean and Sofia's answers were great. Don't go off of finance experience
	•	X: Want to endorse Tori- she's been great, she's been great, does no wrong, etc…
	•	X: Want to endorse Tori and William. We'll have a really young board and need experienced members like them,
	•	X: Want to endorse William, he's a valuable member of the board
	•	X: Want to endorse Tori and Sofia- both bring valuable things to the table
	•	X: Want to echo Tori's sentiments. William has had tough groups and got through it. Both are invaluable
	•	X: Would also like to endorse Tori. Sofia is also great, opposite of apathy
	•	Ani: Question period closed.  We are not doing preferential voting, as before.  Fill in three preferences. 
	•	Ani: We're going to move on to new business:  B-status funding recommendations

IV. New Business: B-Status Funding Recommendations
	•	Lauren:  Not much to introduce.  You all have the funding recommendations in the agenda.  B status groups apply quarterly.  Look them all over and then next week the groups can come in to petition for additional funds.  Email me if you have any questions/concerns.  We allocated approximately $10,000.  Not many groups applied this quarter.  Please send me humorous money quotes.
	•	Alex:  Can we ask questions about specific line items?
	•	Lauren: Yes.  Email me.  Please read over the recommendations before next week.  We deal with so much more money than the SAFC.  Ha ha.  Bitterness.

V. General Order: CampusVoice Demonstration
	•	Ani: Brad will present this once he gets back from the dinner- way to submit issues from the student body
 
Later…
 
	•	Brad: talked about this during campaign as a means to connect students with those who can address their problems. Very robust interface- we're just demoing the software, not asking for funding. Connectivity with facebook…
	•	Brad: Questions?
	•	Rebecca: How much does this software cost and for how long will we be able to use it?
	•	$500 as a lifetime purchase
	•	Ian H: What would be the domain name?
	•	Campusvoice.northwestern.edu
	•	Motoki: Launch date?
	•	First day of winter quarter
	•	Motoki: sustainability for the future?
	•	Ethan: I'll be maintaining and passing on this info
	•	Nalin: Publicity plans?
	•	Brad: No details on that yet, but we'll start winter quarter
	•	Sofia: Can you submit an idea about anything? Way to organize it?
	•	Brad: can search for tags, labels, divide by resolved and unresolved.

VI. New Business: SL1213-14: Service & Community Engagement Grant Amendment
	•	Ani:  With that we're going to move into New Business:  Service and Community Engagement Grant Amendment.
	•	Chris:  Someone brought it up to me that the deadline was a point of contention.  Remember it’s a $500 grant put on for public work in Evanston.  January 1st was the original deadline, but it doesn't leave much time because of the 10K initiative and other things going on.  So we're asking to move the deadline to Feb. 1.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Alex: Is it okay that this cuts down on the time for decisions on which application is chosen?
	•	Chris: They'll still have a month to go through the applications.  This is probably plenty.
	•	X:  Motion to close question period. 
	•	Vote- approved. Question period ended.
	•	Mike:  Motion to move to old business. 
	•	Vote- approved. Legislation is now old business.
	•	X: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- approved. Legislation is passed.

VII. New Business: SL1213-15: Increasing Election Transparency
	•	Steven: Introduced this previously, thought it would be good previously. Opinions have changed, so we're bringing it back up. Meeting with people is a form of campaigning- this needs to be clarified. No rules or regulations to regulate this very gray area. Want to make the rules clear. Important going forward with elections over the next few months.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Corrine: Wasn’t this brought up previously...?
	•	Steven: Yeah, but I feel as if there’s been significant enough change in the composition of Senate to warrant hearing this again.
	•	Rebecca: how would this affect campus media?
	•	Steven: We need to amend this so that it reflects that candidates can't announce to media. It's not meant to start messaging early, only to make sure everything is fair.
	•	Alex: Window of time for announcing candidacy?
	•	Steven: as it stands beginning of winter quarter… but that's not true. Rules committee serves as EX when there is none.
	•	Mike: Is this so that everyone knows who's running earlier?
	•	Steven: Will allow those who are considering running to declare what they're doing. Not for giving people early advertising.
	•	Rebecca: Would this help other candidates outside of ASG
	•	Steven: Ideally, we'll put this on our website and this will let people know what they need to do and let them know they need to declare their intentions to run.
	•	Motoki: Won't this publicity take away from what we do here by creating a winter campaign season
	•	Steven: it's gonna happen no matter what and we have a right to know. It'll help us keep our own numbers accountable.  Also, people won't freak out about articles published about this.
	•	Rebecca: the quarter might be lost to craziness about elections
	•	Steven: I understand that possibility-  yet where will the Daily be getting this information from? It's possible those who candidates meet with will pass this along, but we can solve that.
	•	Noah: How public are the meetings?
	•	Steven: Daily isn't a tabloid, wouldn't go crazy over this
	•	McKenzie: this isn't something the Daily would cover.
	•	Motoki: Wouldn't ambiguity…
	•	Steven: want to make it so that any meetings are seen for what they are- just meetings for candidacy so that we can be clear.
	•	Alex Lower: How binding is this declaration of intent to run
	•	Steven: Not binding, just declaring interest.
	•	Ani: This is new business, we’ll hear it as old business next week

VIII. Good of the Order and Announcements
	•	Motoki: 6:30 Saturday PMA and SAI are having a fall recital at Alice Millar
	•	Sarah: DG hosting Anchor Bowl on Deering Meadow
	•	Katie: Hosting TFA event tomorrow, 6-7:30 in Louis Room. NCDC also having event in Francis Searle
	•	Sarah: Mega-Shabbat  wanted to open ASG table in January/winter
	•	Evan: NU water polo team is having a match this weekend at SPAC
	•	Steven: This Friday, Protest magazine is releasing their first issue of the year and next Wednesday, we're co-sponsoring a panel on affirmative action
	•	David H: Project cookie has launched Project Cookie presence- can send to friends or anonymous lovers- or as a gift for a holiday next month
	•	Also a DM heroes event- great chance to see the beneficiaries of the money you're raising
	•	Ciara: This Saturday is national aids awareness day, will have events this weekend

Senate Adjourned



Northwestern University
Associated Student Government
Meeting of the Senate
November, 5, 2014

	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	General Order: CourseDJ Presentation
	•	Christina: My committee has been working really hard to launch this for winter registration. The idea came about from the hackathon. 
	•	http://coursedj.asg.northwestern.edu
	•	This is soemthing we’ve been working on in Services for awhile. It is pretty similar to course seek. If you have a bunch of classes and don’t know which ones you want to take, it lets you visualize which schedule you want. 
	•	Christina: What you see on Caesar is what you see on the app. 
	•	You can put which courses are mandatory and it will keep it there for all potential schedules. 
	•	New Business: SR1415-01: Speak Out Against Religious Intolerance
	•	Jonathan: Some of you may know that there is a Chabad location off campus and the menorah has been vandalized three times in the last sixth months. Basically the registration is calling on ASG to speak out again these acts of religious intolerance. Any act against a religious group is unacceptable at this university. We are saying that we promote an open and inclusive environment and that we stand for respect. The last part is symbolic support for a new menorah within the next couple of weeks. We would like to move it to old business this week, so just keep that in mind. 
	•	Noah: We are in line for questions. 
	•	Lauren: Why do you feel the need to move this to old business? 
	•	Ariel: We want to be timely and not wait to condemn it. 
	•	Moira: Logistically, since Chabad is technically off campus, is it a problem that the language of the legislation talks about campus community? 
	•	Jonathan: We don’t link Chabad to Northwestern. 
	•	Austin: Have you reported this to RespectNU? 
	•	Jonathan: We have not. 
	•	Ariel: I motion to move this to old business. 
	•	Second.
	•	No objections. 
	•	Noah: All those in favor of moving to old business? It will be moved to the end of the agenda. 
	•	New Business: SL1415-05: A Not So Wild Idea: Closing Loopholes 
	•	Isaac: This is really small and hopefully uncontroversial. We passed the Wild Ideas Fund and said that everything under $150 did not have to be presented. This just says that the WIFC needs to present all approved grants. 
	•	New Business: SL1415-06: Mental Health Working Group
	•	Chris: I am coming to Senate today because the code asks that Senate approves working groups. This idea came out of a conversation with NU Listens and NU Active Minds. We really need to take a more holistic approach and look at the landscape of mental health on campus. It’s been a big focus, but the response has been patchwork. We’ve talked a lot about programs and stances and some of us feel we don’t know what is best, because we don’t know what the landscape really is. Everyone has different stances and stressors. It says 6-10 people, but we would also seek the thoughts of others through focus groups. 
	•	Chris: Motion to move to old business. 
	•	Noah: Seeing no objections we will vote on whether to move it to old business. That passes and we will bump that down to the end of the agenda. 
	•	Old Business: SL 1415-03 Bureaucracy Must Die
	•	Alex: Hi everyone. We’ve talked about this before, but to summarize this is getting rid of the ASG T-status designation and establishing that groups will go through CSI. Once they are established, groups would be funneled to various funding resources, one of which is ASG. We will be proposing an amendment about the CSI process. The most notable thing is that there is going to be a committee of three students and representatives from the different funding bodies. The representation will be the SGVP, the Director of New Student Groups, and someone from SARC. We thought it was important to have the different perspectives. You can look at the different documents attached in the legislation. The first is the CSI application for groups. The second is information about the various funding sources and grants on campus. 
	•	Ruba: Is the committee for CSI or ASG? 
	•	Ariel: CSI
	•	Noah: We will now move into debate. We are in line of a con, question or amendment. 
	•	Ariel: Motion to amend. 
	•	Alex: The amendment says that the SGVP, the Director of New Student Groups, and one person from SARC will sit on the committee. We also noticed that the Director of New Student Groups position wasn’t explicitly defined. We think it needs to be a permanent part of the SGC. It removes a section that is about the New Student Groups Committee that never really existed. 
	•	Previous Question. 
	•	Noah: We will now vote on this amendment. It passes unanimously. Now we are in line for a con on the bill. 
	•	Previous Question. 
	•	Noah: We will now vote. It passes unanimously. 
Old Business: SR1415-01: Speak Out Against Religious Intolerance
	•	Natalie: From an administrative standpoint, the only issue I see is the last line. Are we expecting Northwestern to put any monetary value to that? We as ASG and Northwestern don’t have any control over Chabad. I think that needs to be clarified. 
	•	Will: Does support always mean monetary support? 
	•	Noah: It is just ambiguous. natalie is saying we need to be clearer about it. 
	•	Isaac: But a resolution never allocated money. 
	•	Lauren: Have they already decided? Maybe we can say ASG supports Chabad’s decision?
	•	Chris: Motion to amend. For clarity, I move to just remove that last line. There is no reason someone can’t ask us to put money later. I don’t think that line adds something the other two lines don’t say already. 
	•	Isaac: I think that in terms of what it adds, it adds that we think it would be a good idea to replace the menorah. I want to reiterate that I don’t see the issue in agreeing with them, even if they’re suing us, whatever is going on. 
	•	Jake: I think we should omit it. 
	•	Ronak: I think by omitting this section, you get rid of a large part of the resolution. Though there is probably a better way to reword it. 
	•	Alec: I think that statement adds that we support them moving forward. The word support does not imply financial support. 
	•	Chris: We in this room know that is what we mean, but that doesn’t mean everyone else knows. But I agree. I withdraw my motion. I instead move to say that “Northwestern ASG supports Chabad placing a menorah in front of the Chabad House”. 
	•	Previous Question. 
	•	Noah: Passes unanimously. 
	•	We are now in discussion of the resolution as a whole. 
	•	PQ. 
	•	Noah: Passes unanimously.

II. Caucus Whip Reports
	•	Ani: New thing, we're going to try and have this every 2 weeks- basic update of caucus progress.
	•	Ian: Met with University Library Committee- talking about ways to renovate Deering, moving the music library, maps to scan in for transportation library.
	•	To talk about my caucus- no one came to the off-campus forum, but it was a good time. Motoki and Nouha are working on a street cleaning/zoning map for streets- also working on a garage sale. And finally working with off-campus ambassadors, since they were recently selected.
	•	Sarah: for Greek caucus, very new caucus, have been focusing on how to get Senators more acclimated and what we wanted to work on
	•	Paul: We also had a fair bit of turnover and spent time making sure everyone was comfortable in Senate and on a committee. Working on system for reserving meeting rooms and making it more streamlined
	•	Lauren: RHA/RCB spent time transitioning new Senators as well. Also focused on getting Senators in to talk at dorm firesides

III. Special Order: Presentation and Q&A by Burgie Howard, Assistant VP for Student Engagement at Northwestern
	•	Ani: Burgie recently moved to student engagement, we're happy to have him here tonight.
	•	Burgie: JPK works on student services, I work on the fun stuff: Center for Student Involvement, Multicultural Student Affairs, New Student and Family Programs, Fraternity and Sorority Life, and Religious Life- basically where students interact with each other- want to figure out how to knit these five areas together. Also tasked with events shared in common- like March to the Arch. The more common experiences we can create, the more shared experiences for students. Also about connecting alumni services with current students- really looking to connect common experiences, whatever they may be. Been working with ASG to clear up systems and inconsistencies and have a more seamless experience. Discusses trainings for student leaders and advisers and have a more common training experience and get into networking- want to make sure the student network is there so when opportunities arise, students can get them. The idea of how we encourage the interaction between students is my job- small communities are good, but they need to be porous. We're talking about student leadership, student orgs,  and tying resources like SOFO and Wildcat Connection to students. Our departmental strategic plan is being finalized, we're going to actualize it soon.
	•	Ani: Opening the floor for questions-
	•	Sarah: So in the student handbook, the freshman freeze policy was changed and it is soon up reevaluation- how will it be evaluated and is there room for student input?
	•	Burgie: the conversation will be starting in February- been talking to the new IFC and PHA presidents. We'd welcome some input on this and to take an honest look at our progress in achieving the best system possible/
	•	April: How will Wildcat Connection be better utilized as a tool?
	•	Burgie: We haven't fully figured out the total capacity of the platform, but certainly good as a search tool and historical record. Transitions are a large problem, so having a common platform where information is kept is useful. Information now is in the cloud or on someone's hard drive- want to use Wildcat Connection to connect new members of an organization with what's been done in the past. Want all student groups to utilize this. Also want to be able to keep track of groups that have fallen by the wayside, and make sure important documents can exist beyond one generation of a group.
	•	Burgie: If you're a Senator for a particular group, I'm happy to come out and talk/listen to how students experience the university. My office is in Seaburry (600 Haven St.) on the second floor with a lot of other student affairs areas.

IV. General Order: Study Abroad Guide Mock-up
	•	David: We've been working on this with the study-abroad office and they're fully in support of something like this. We're trying to create a more informative study abroad guide that gives students more of an idea of what to expect when going abroad. Yay technology!
	•	Alison: Would've loved to have more experience from peers on study abroad when I was planning my trip- students don't have information relevant to study abroad.
	•	Kallie: You have the study abroad website- which is great to get started, but nothing about the culture or what to do once you get to that country. Trip advisors may not be from Northwestern and are decentralized, and emailing friends is inconvenient.
	•	Alison: So, we want to be able to get study abroad experiences from students- the study abroad office is very excited about this. The demand is there.
	•	Kallie: We want to create a for students, by students guide to studying abroad.
	•	Alison: Not a replacement for study abroad office website, just a supplement. Also not meant to prohibit discovery/education. Finally wants to be important source of students deciding where to study.
	•	Kallie: wants to be able to provide different aspects of city than what's available in resources currently.
	•	Allison: Looking at top 10 most popular places and going off from there contacting students just returning from those destinations. Meant to be easy to update
	•	David: And here's the mock-up
	•	David: Questions?
	•	Mark: How to reconcile particular academic programs vs. locations themselves? Also, some programs integrate sea travel or travel to multiple cities- is there anyway to account for that?
	•	David: Poignant question- hadn't thought of first half of question. Want to prioritize where students go most often, but definitely want to work on that eventually. On the second half of that question- we're still going to stick to core locations, but this would still hopefully be helpful for the cities you're visiting. This will touch a lot of different students and don't want to confound it too much by adding too much into the equation
	•	Kallie: even if it doesn't have specific information, could still be listed as a destination on the application.
	•	Sarah: For the contributions tab, would my responses go straight up or would the responses be partially posted based on what's relevant?
	•	David: The latter- we'll be looking for information that lines up with our format and determining whether a contribution is even relevant.
	•	Sofia: Any way to assign priority to responses?
	•	David: Good point, though might be hard to implement technically. Might be feasible further down the road, but don't want to let it hinder us releasing this. Definitely something to look into.
	•	Mark: There are other opportunities to get off campus besides study abroad, like those in fellowship or other study programs, might be a good idea to reach out to this crowd as well.
	•	David: Good idea.
	•	David: Please email me with further questions!

V. Old Business: B-Status Funding Recommendations

	•	SGC (Paul): The SGC will support due to being a standardized cost and an event that's been done in the past
	•	Jane: what venue and how much?
	•	Caroline: Haven't selected a venue yet, so not totally sure of the cost, but $300 is standardized for most venues.

	•	Ben: Motion to add a group/line item to list- Northwestern Flipside requesting $200 for paper and ink for printing
	•	Ben: Hi, I'm the Treasurer for the Northwestern Flipside, Northwestern’s satirical publication. Dropped the ball and forgot to request funding this quarter. We're NU's satirical publication on campus, we rely on ASG funding for our issues and without it, it's nearly impossible. The $200 is for paper and ink.
	•	Ani: First need to approve adding the item to the list and then the amount.
	•	SGC (Lauren): I support them being added to the list
	•	Ian: Motion to previous question
	•	Vote- approved. Flipside is added to the list.
	•	Ben: $200 is standardized cost that we’ve received from ASG in the past that allows us to print 2-3 times a quarter.
	•	Ani: questions?
	•	Sarah: if someone forgets to turn in funding is there a standard penalty?
	•	Lauren: still figuring this out, had our first run in with this last quarter, empirically made a 50% cut.
	•	Ian: Why should we fund you in full?
	•	Ben: Complete oversight on my part- we rely on ASG for funding and it'd be pretty rough on us.
	•	Jane: Motion to amend- decrease request by 20%- down to $160.
	•	Jane: There should be some penalty, but as an organization, we have to have some penalty. We want to still give money, just a little less
	•	Carly (question): Has Flipside had problems with turning in funding applications in the past?
	•	Lauren: Flipside is fairly new for funding, actually. Only started applying for funding 4 quarters ago after determining that the publication was Flipside's primary source of programming and that funding should be allotted to them.
	•	Alex (question): how important is a steady precedent for turning in applications on time?
	•	Lauren: pretty important- great that you're here, but I've let other groups who've tried to turn in their application late that they're just out of luck. Things would be crazy if every group tried to submit late.
	•	McKenzie (question): Any success with attracting advertisers?
	•	Ben: success with online advertising, but need more time putting out consistent print advertising
	•	Noah (question): How much does $200 get you as far as issues goes? Like would funding you $160 versus $200 lead to only 1.8 issues being able to be made, and would that .8 just not happen?
	•	Ben: we'd just print less issues overall- we'll deal with whatever amount we get, but less money means less issues.
	•	Petros (question): What would you stand to lose as far as advertisers from this penalty?
	•	Ben: Hard to say, but advertisers don't want to advertise in a publication that isn't regularly or widely  released.
	•	Ian (question): Is all content available on your website?
	•	Ben: we have some print exclusive content
	•	Chris: Motion to Previous question
	•	Mark: Objection
	•	Chris: Withdrawn
	•	Jesse: As a note, let's keep in mind that not funding this wouldn't necessarily be killing the project, just would force them to find other sources of funding and fundraise.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con.
	•	Ian (pro): Penalty is generous, won't limit issues, but a good move to show there's a penalty for turning this in late
	•	Motoki (con): Funded them usually at $150 in previous cycles, want to recommend much lower since this would be an increase as is.
	•	Ben (pro): Yes, we were originally allocated $150, but in-Senate appeals have gotten us up to $200 with every funding cycle in the past- didn't mean to mislead, just quoting the amount we empirically got at the end of the day.
	•	Mark (pro): We always grant them the extra $50, lets just do it.
	•	Jesse (con): For us to have given them funding, they should've turned in their app on time. Shouldn't fund at all, really.
	•	Motoki: Motion to amend the amendment to $100
	•	Rebecca: Objection
	•	Motoki (pro): This is what the SGC recommends- our recommendation every quarter has been $150- giving them additional funding restricts the funding pool and penalizes other groups. Bad precedent to set.
	•	Jane (con): this is stupid- let's not penalize them this much. It's $30-$40 and will significantly help their programming.
	•	Ani: Let's move away from calling fellow Senator's motions stupid and ad hominem attacks.
	•	Lauren (pro): Please consider this- this application was turned in last night, the applications were due in October. Feel uncomfortable only cutting 20%. Though he makes a good case, cuts like this sometimes need to be made to preserve fairness for all groups.
	•	SGC GE (con): Sent out recommendations last week, so had a week to send in application, sent it in last night.

	•	[Confusion]

	•	Ian: Motion to previous question on hearing the amendment
	•	Vote on seeing the amendment
	•	14 yea
	•	4 nay
	•	6 abstentions
	•	Vote-passed. Amendment will be heard.
	•	Mike (question): what is the exposure for your print issues?
	•	Ben: Distribute in various locations around campus- roughly 90% of campus is covered
	•	David: How much of this screw up was on you, vs. the group?
	•	Ben: Completely on me.
	•	Ani: In line for pro/con on reducing to $100
	•	Mike (con): too harsh of a penalty for one person's fault
	•	Senator: Really successful distribution, no need to cut.
	•	Ian (pro): is in line with SGC allotment and is honestly fairer taking into account initial SGC recommendations in the past
	•	SGC GE (pro): we support their programming, but need to have consistency. Let them do fundraising for this cycle.
	•	Lauren (pro): This is not a question of their merit, it's a question of them not following procedure and setting a precedent
	•	Mark (con): We are a legislative body, this is up to us despite what the SGC says. I'm supportive of $160- I find this all exhausting.
	•	Lauren (pro): We know these groups, please value our opinions as we spend all year working on this.
	•	Victor (pro): precedent matters a lot- will fundamentally augment how student groups will look at this
	•	Motion to previous question
	•	Vote-  
	•	12 yea
	•	8 nay
	•	8 abstentions
	•	Vote- passed. Line item is approved.
	•	Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote-passed. NU Flipside is granted $100.
	•	Ani: Moving to the second add round.
	•	Senator: Motion to close add round.
	•	Vote- passed. Second add round is closed.
	•	Ani: Funding is closed.

VI. Old Business: SL1213-15: Increasing Election Transparency
	•	Steven: Elections happened- there's a large grey area not regulated by any party, the period before the election period in which meetings happen with stakeholders. Anyone considering running must declare their intention on running to the rules committee.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Rebecca: Is this legislation just for positions of Pres and VP?
	•	Steven: All campus-wide elected positions.
	•	Jesse: How to enforce this?
	•	Steven: Logistical mechanisms need to be enforced- make sure that student groups know this is a thing. Really down to the Rules committee.
	•	Jesse: What would be the consequences of violating this?
	•	Steven: Campaign violation possibly- if you get three, you're out of the race.
	•	Motoki: Is this necessary since Rules oversees this? Need for this legislation when Rules can manage this?
	•	Steven: These meetings aren't against the Rules- want to consider these meetings as verbal campaigning. Need for clarification.
	•	Sarah: Would you be open to just editing the election guidelines to better define verbal campaigning?
	•	Steven: Hard to pinpoint what is and isn't verbal campaigning.
	•	David: Would another problem be that there isn't a clear mechanism for identifying campaign violations when there aren't candidates?
	•	Steven: That's part of it
	•	Ian: Is this declaration for broadcast or just for the purposes of meeting with students?
	•	Steven: Important for people to know they can talk about their platform openly, which restricts those who are unclear with the Rules.
	•	Sarah: We have an info session annually before the campaigning period to outline rules surrounding this- is the problem that the election info session is held too late?
	•	Brad: Definitely doesn't occur soon enough- yet if you hold it 3 months prior, most people haven't yet made up their mind about running.
	•	Steven: Again, this isn't a binding declaration
	•	Brad: a friendly amendment to this legislation would be requiring that that meeting gets held earlier.
	•	Sarah: Why can't that meeting happen if we make it well enough known?
	•	Brad: You could declare at any time with this
	•	Sarah: What's stopping people from going into Rules and asking about it?
	•	Steven: Didn't have the Rules Committee available as a resource to those running last year- multiple interpretations were floating around. It's for everyone else to know, would free up individuals to declare their intention to run.
	•	Rachel: Who could declare?
	•	Steven: Anyone who is interested
	•	Hannah: Is this just an issue of making the rules clearer and publicizing better?
	•	Steven: this is an attempt to clarify the rules, in a place where the election process isn't clear- there's nothing in the guidelines about the time before the election period.
	•	Brad: we don't want anyone saying you can't have these meetings- they're informative and necessary to forming your platform and make the campaign stronger and make better candidates- unfortunately, no means to regulate this are available now.
	•	Mike: Just trying to get an idea of this- what's trying to be accomplished with this?
	•	Steven: This isn't air-tight- this is meant to target high profile meetings in which endorsements are involved, where people meet with student leaders to get ideas of what student leaders want to get an endorsement in the end. It can get shady- it happens and we don't think it's the best way of conducting an election.
	•	Rachel: Why not just add to the rules that you declare you're running?
	•	Steven: On principle, this needs to happen
	•	Ani: To restate the election guidelines on this matter… "Verbal campaigning shall be defined as campaigning that consists of spoken words and does not involve any written materials. "
	•	Sarah: It's the goal of ASG that all interested parties know about this information- how doesn't this start the election much earlier?
	•	Steven: Safeguards put in place, like prohibiting campaign interaction with media. Daily needs two verifiable sources and anonymous leaked info isn't used.
	•	Ian: Do you see the list of names being the responsibility of the Rules committee and utilized for violations? Or something that anyone who asks can get?
	•	Steven: Not completely sure, I'd be amenable to Senate giving feedback on this.
	•	Rachel: Would this give those in Senate an advantage since only Senate is being told?
	•	Steven: Passing this would lead to that being less likely, actually.
	•	David: Motion to amend- add in the requirement of meeting with the election commission after declaring.
	•	David: Add in the line: "and have a meeting with the Election Commission"
	•	David: Also edit language to state: "Only students who have officially declared that they are exploring the possibility of running for office may schedule formal or informal meetings with student leaders and administrators for the purpose of planning their campaigns or creating campaign platforms."
	•	Rebecca: Was under the impression that this is supposed to start campaigning in Winter...
	•	Brad: Important to acknowledge that four campaign teams have already met with me even this quarter.
	•	Mike: Can we table this?
	•	Ani: Yes, we could.
	•	David: Motion to previous question on the amendment.
	•	Vote- passes. Amendments are integrated into the legislation.
	•	Steven: Motion to amend to add to the bill that students who have considered running, and their campaign, cannot discuss any parts of the campaign with the media.
	•	Steven: withdrawn
	•	Ani: Moving to pro/con on the legislation
	•	Carly (con): Basically daring the Daily to start writing stories, would start campaign period early and would make us an organization that spends most of its time campaigning.
	•	Ian: Motion to amend: add line "The identity of the persons declaring intentions must be held confidential"
	•	Ian: Names shouldn’t be open to others- undermines the process, should only be used by election commission for the purposes of determining violations.
	•	Katie (question): doesn't this just create more work for Rules?
	•	Ian: Important to just leave it on file and for Rules to not inadvertently reveal others are running
	•	David: Point of clarification- if you're running and you're any student, you can confirm, right?
	•	Ian: Making this clearer is required.
	•	Sarah: Confused as to what this changes and does not change- would it now be in the guidelines to tell people that you're considering to run, but don't want the EC to declare that?
	•	Ian: names should only be used for campaign violations down the road
	•	Steven: Would you be amenable to trying to address some of the concerns during pro/con on the bill, since we haven't even been able to discuss it yet?
	•	Ian: I'm leaving my amendment on the table.
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con on Ian's amendment
	•	Brad: Amendment to amendment: Include the President and Executive Vice President in the crowd of people allowed to know who's running.
	•	Brad: We get approached by many people who want to run, and provide insight to them, really awkward if we can't talk to them.
	•	Brad: Doesn't want to add AVP or SLVP because of complications- we are the highest office, should come to us with interest in running since you can't really supersede our positions.
	•	Lauren (question): Why can't they just talk to you, nothing really against this?
	•	Brad: Puts us in a awkward position by violating our own rules

	•	[Confusion]

	•	Steven (con): this amendment is only useful when blocking everyone from knowing, won't cause media-shitstorm
	•	Motoki: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- fails. Brad's amendment is defeated.
	•	Sarah: Motion to table indefinitely
	•	Senator: Objection
	•	Sarah (pro): This is significant, we need to look at this- but most parties debating this are authors on this bill- evidence that we need to discuss this more outside of Senate. Should be concrete before this comes to the floor and that starts with a full understanding by the authors
	•	Ani: Moving into pro/con on whether or not to table indefinitiely
	•	David (con): Since Isaac tabled my bill freshman year, will always urge not to table bills. It's really silly. This either needs to be defeated or not, this is the place and time to do it.
	•	Chris (question): Why can't we postpone this until the first Senate of next quarter?
	•	David: If this fails, there needs to be another bill to address this, if not, it needs to be enacted ASAP ideally, since people are having these meetings right now.
	•	Brad (pro): what this bill is trying to get at is that it has profound implications we haven't explored yet- we tabled the bill because of this conversation. Something about it needs to change.
	•	Rebecca (con): this is the place where we have these debates and propose amendments and have questions. We have so many questions that need to be heard.
	•	Steven (con): no major change- status quo doesn't work- need to see suggestions for change
	•	Vote-approved. This bill is tabled indefinitely.

VII. New Business: SL1213-16: Freshman Freeze Working Group
	•	Sarah: we're going to make this quick- going to motion to table this indefinitely since we found out that there are other parties who want to be involved with this that we haven't been able to meet with.
	•	Vote- approved. Legislation is tabled indefinitely.

VIII. New Business: SL1213-17: Sustainability Stickers
	•	Mark: Really straightforward, considering the other stuff we've gotten through tonight. Just want $100 to print stickers to put on all of the resources we'll be distributing, like low-flow shower heads and shower timers.
	•	Ani: Questions?
	•	Noah: to apply these stickers, you have to peel them off individually from paper- how will you deal with this waste?
	•	Mark: Will be dealt with appropriately.
	•	Ian: Will these stickers fit on everything you want to distribute?
	•	Mark: went with smaller size stickers to make sure it can fit on all of the stuff.
	•	Rebecca: No one will see these, shower heads are tall.
	•	Mark: Will be able to see these when they install them, ideally.
	•	Senator: Motion to make this old business.
	•	Vote- approved. Legislation is old business.
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- approved. Legislation is passed and $100 is allocated.

IX. New Business: SR1213-05 : Mental Health: One Campus, One Community
	•	Noah: Mental health is important- want to support creating a better culture of mental health at NU
	•	Alex: This is really meant to encourage the administration to work to improve mental health resources at NU. We can bring this to the table and say ASG, along with the rest of the student body, supports this becoming a priority.
	•	Senator: Motion to amend- the fourth clause specifically refers to Alyssa Weaver and Harsha, want to modify language to state that "recent events" have spurred the need for mental health reform.
	•	Vote- approved. Legislation is amended.
	•	Senator: Motion to make this old business.
	•	Vote- approved. Legislation is old business.
	•	Senator: Motion to previous question.
	•	Vote- approved. Legislation is passed unanimously.

Northwestern University
Associated Student Government
Meeting of the Senate
December, 3, 2014

	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	General Order: Wild Ideas Proposal for Take Time and Minichefz
	•	Andrew: Minichefz is a T-status group that teaches kids to make meals for themselves and then for the Take Care campaign we funded cotton candy and popcorn machines. 
	•	General Order: Student Groups Vice President Application and Selection
	•	Andrew: The application is open starting today and due January 4th. The application is linked in the agenda and reach out to Alex or me with any questions. 
	•	Noah: Since the application is due on the 4th, we need to pick the member of the student body that will serve on the selection committee. 
	•	Alec: I’d like to nominate Ariel. 
	•	Ariel: I accept. 
	•	Bella: I’d like to nominate Isaac.
	•	Isaac: I accept. 
	•	Jaime: I’d like to nominate Eliza. 
	•	Eliza: I accept. 
	•	Joji: I’d like to nominate Ruba. 
	•	Ruba: I respectfully decline. 
	•	Johnny: I nominate Kevin. 
	•	Kevin: I decline. 
	•	Ariel: First of all I’ve been a GE for awhile. This year I’ve been able to work really closely with Alex and I feel like I have a good idea of how the committee functions and what the person should be like. If I wasn’t a senior, I’d probably run for the position. 
	•	Isaac: I’m running because I’ve never been on a selection committee. I think I have a lot of knowledge of ASG as a whole and I think that it is an asset that I am not a GE. I think it would be good to have someone who has that perspective on how we can do funding better. 
	•	Eliza: I was a Senator last year and joined SGC and SAFC. I’ve got to work with groups and work closely with Alex. I think I really understand what is needed and there is a lot of potential for the group. 
	•	Sam: What would your ideal candidate look like? 
	•	Isaac: I’m looking for someone who is flexible and is open to change. I want someone who will work well on an exec board. They have to be able to cooperate with new people, especially the FVP and the SAVP. I also want someone who can manage a committee well. I’m on two committees so I have seen different leaderships. 
	•	Eliza: It is a group that interacts with a lot of student groups, so you need someone who wants to form a relationship with those groups. Obviously the person needs to be a good leader, but for this position specifically, you need someone who can look beyond just funding.  Ariel: First, experience. I think there is a lot of internal information, so it is hard for someone without SGC experience to come in. But I also think personality might be more important, because they aren’t just working with the exec board and the committee, but also over 100 groups.
	•	Bella: What are words you’d use to describe your ideal leader?
	•	Eliza: Excitement, Enthusiasm, Leadership, Collaboration. 
	•	Ariel: Passion, Commitment, Leader, Empathy,  Organized. 
	•	Isaac: Empathetic, Visionary, Critical, Kind, Helpful. 
	•	General Order: A-Status Funding Reminder
	•	Noah: We’re going to do a-status funding now. McKenzie is going to give an overarching view, I’m going to talk about debate procedure
	•	McKenzie: I emailed noah a randomized list of all groups. we’ll read through them, and if you want more $ speak up and we’ll have a 3 round debate period. Then we’ll have a cut round, then we’ll have another add round
	•	That 13K figure is for all the money in the senate amendment pool. the amount that doesn’t get spent goes into supplemental funding. 
	•	Isaac: Is there a ruberic to evaluate events? 
	•	McKenzie: We have an event evaluation sheet. And funding is tiered. 
	•	Moira: In terms of deciding how you value events and considering the money is coming from students, why do you think it is more important behind the scenes than what the students see (like attendance)? 
	•	Jason: It really varies on the group. We can’t take attendance too much into account, because some groups will always pull bigger numbers. All the different guidelines we use have been used for a long time and we revise them each year. 
	•	Sean: We fund based on what we can see and how consistent things are and attendance doesn’t always reflect that. 
	•	Old  Business: A-Status Funding
	•	Add Round. 
	•	SASA: Motion to add. Adding $1400 to honorarium. 
	•	Parag: I was a former Senator and currently the president of SASA. 
	•	Naveen: And I am currently the senator of SASA. 
	•	Parag: I understand that attendance is only one small factor, but it went up by 1000%, which I think reflects that the event was successful. The main reason they cut us was because of poor planning. We only had one month to plan, because of a new executive board and because we did not have access to funding. With a new executive board it is definitely going to be difficult, but we stayed in contact with our AE. There were contract issues, but we will avoid those issues, because we are starting the contract process now. The problems won’t happen again, because we are starting 6 months in advance this time. 
	•	Sean/SAFC: I think something that is important to understand is historical knowledge. In the winter, SASA and MCSA do a cospon together. That cospon did not happen, because of a breakdown in communication and those funds weren’t used. That is a misconduct. Then in the spring they told us the spring concert would not happen if they didn’t take the funding from the winter concert. We said the event was a failure, because they would not have been successful without the first failure. It sounds like your exec board is taking a lot of steps, which is great and they are required to do so because of their misconduct. We cannot fund based on hope or confidence, that can be rewarded in the next funding cycle. Once they implement this stuff, that is when they should be rewarded. Giving an increase to this event would be a slap in the face to all Northwestern students, because you are using their money. 
	•	Isaac: When you agreed to their transfer request, did you say there would be a misconduct involved?
	•	Sean: No, because they already had a misconduct from the event failing. We didn’t give them an extra one, since the event did happen. 
	•	Isaac: Was it an extension or just no extra penalty? 
	•	McKenzie: For a misconduct, groups are called in and we hear their side of the story. From there the SAFC can vote to misconduct and then there are different kinds of misconducts. MCSA/SASA now has planning guidances, because a lot of their communication issues were about what kind of speaker they wanted. They don’t have a specific misconduct that affects funding, but they could if they don’t take the rest of the planning guidelines into account. 
	•	Sean: Also they cancelled one of their events for the past year to put their money into the Spring speaker, so the actual funding is higher than what is reflected in the funding packet. 
	•	Noah read a statement from SASA’s advisor. 
	•	Parag: The Spring concert would have happened even if the petition had not been approved, it just would have been a different speaker. We agreed about the misconduct from the cospon and thought it would be better to transfer the money to the Spring concert. That is partly to blame on the new board, but also the old board. My main point is we would not have received a misconduct on the Spring concert, it just would have been a different event. I don’t think the misconduct for the cospon should affect the Spring concert, but just the cospon. The petition to move the funds was approved, so I urge you not to look at the separate misconduct. 
	•	Jason: During every petition process, groups can submit for petitions. We ask at the end of the process what would happen if the petition was not approved and in our notes it says that it would not happen. Also we look at groups as a whole. 
	•	Isaac: I want to speak in favor of adding the number. It feels like they are being punished on the cospon and that’s fine, but that is a separate account according to SAFC, so it should affect the SASA funding. I also don’t think that the funding packet should say the event was unsuccessful, because it was not. As Senate we are not limited in how this money should be allotted. SAFC is a really important body, but they are not the last word - we are. 
	•	Ariel: Is the misconduct limited to the event or to the group? 
	•	To the group. 
	•	McKenzie: Part of what we do is relying on the groups and on advisors. This group would not have been put on without the Norris Production Staff. They were running around on the day. From a planning perspective, Norris Production Staff should not have to salvage an event. 
	•	Wendy: Was this submitted in time for Norris’s team? 
	•	Parag: A lot about them running around was because the artist was late, which is something we tried to control and couldn’t. Other than that, the event ran smoothly. I understand that SAFC has to look at that specific event but as Senators you can take more things into consideration. 
	•	Noah: We are now going to hear from people with extra information, 
	•	Judy: I’m Judy and I am the Business Manager for Norris and I advise the SAFC. I usually don’t say anything, because this is your business, however, one of the things I advocate is reflecting on what has happened, but you do have to consider other people’s standards. In that vein, there was an awful lot of things that were not considered before the event was to take place. It was not just the artist, but also the group didn’t communicate with the Norris people who were going to be there. At the very last minute, the entire production needed to be altered. The contract was given to the production staff three days before, even though they had it earlier. They need to learn from this. The SAFC decided they weren’t going to cut them off, but they weren’t going to reward them. That’s the context - it isn’t just the numbers.
	•	Natalie: Part of what Norris and CSI does is that we want to have successful events. If we have already signed a contract,w e had not choice but to run around to make this happen. We signed the contract and it had to happen. There was a lot of miscommunication and we can take some ownership as administrators also. I’m just the signature, so I trust that the group has organized the event. We are then bound by that contract legally. 
	•	Alec: Is there a time limit? 
	•	Noah: Yes, and we are in the third and final round.
	•	Sean: As Senate, you technically can do whatever you want and I was not trying to suggest otherwise. But you do not exist in the vacuum and you have higher responsibilities. Once they put on a kick ass - great event, then they will be rewarded, because that will be fair. We fund by success of event, but we also take into account the broad context of the group - like the cospon. 
	•	Motion to extend by two rounds. 
	•	Second. 
	•	Alex: Object. I think we’ve heard enough and I’m tired of bickering. If you haven’t decided by now, you should just abstain. 
	•	Noah: Let’s not patronize people. We are in line for a pro. 
	•	Moira: I know I have things to say and other people probably do. 
	•	PQ
	•	It passes. 
	•	Moira: I would like to point out that - I think some of the things SAFC has been saying is trying to intimidate us into voting one way or another. Saying if you vote against the SAFC is not fair to students, I think that is a ridiculous and unfounded claim. I think you should go on the basis of what is fair for students and what students want. What was the value of this event to the student body? They have reiterated many times why they only had one month and that is what happens when you only have a month. The most successful events are things that are constantly changing even at the last minute. When things are planned in a bureaucratic way, that is not necessarily what the students want. 
	•	Wendy: Yes we have the power, but we elected the SAFC members. It is not fair if we overlook some rules, because it affects all the groups that turned their contracts in in time. 
	•	Jason: We spend about 40 hours on funding each time and review all the information - there is a lot that goes into the funding process, which is why we get a little bit passionate. You do have the final say and we were elected by you. 
	•	Parag: I think it comes down to whether you think this event will be successful. I understand that SAFC can’t look at our planning process, but you guys can. 
	•	Sean: That idea completely goes against guidelines we establish to ensure the money of the students is spent well. We can’t look to the future and that is what they are asking. The SAFC operates on precedent and you guys are too. It wouldn’t make sense to say no to future groups that say they are going to put on a good event if you let SASA have extra funding. There is nothing unique going on here and there is no need for a unique exception like this. 
	•	7-12-7, the motion fails. 
	•	Noah read the rest of the A status names. 
	•	Cut round. 
	•	Add round. 
	•	SASA: Motion to add $470 to honorarium. 
	•	Parag: I understand that you don’t want to give us an increase, but I think SASA should have the same money we got last year. I don’t think we should be punished twice for the failure of the cospon. 
	•	Ariel: What about the extra money? 
	•	Parag: We decided to combine the money from our Winter Speaker with the Spring Concert, but I think that should be separate. Including the extra money, our total is $20,300 with the events combined. 
	•	Bella: How does the petition process interact with funding by event? 
	•	Sean: That’s why the petition process exists, to sort out the changes in event by event funding. I can’t say why, but it was convincing. 
	•	Parag: We wanted to reduce overprogramming and improve the events. 
	•	Sean: The money from the petition was already allotted to them, so we didn’t mind them switching it. 
	•	Noah: The numbers for the various changes are now on the board. 
	•	Isaac: To what level does the SAFC take into account the line items versus the total? 
	•	Jason: The fact that they rolled over money did not affect the recommendation we made for the line item of the event. For the decrease we took into account only the spring funding from the previous year. 
	•	McKenzie: We don’t think we are putting the group in double jeopardy. The cospon didn’t fail, SASA failed. And $470 might look nominal compared to the rest of the funding, but it really isn’t. 
	•	Moira: I think we should be focusing on the specific line item and the numbers we just went over is irrelevant. We are not giving them a reward if we give them this, it would just be the same. There may have been a problem with the planning, but that is offset by the success of the events. You could say it is just symbolic, but they could use the $470 dollars. It is only bringing it back to the funding 
	•	Parag: Quick motion, I would like to cut it to 400. 
	•	PQ 
	•	Objection
	•	Withdrawn
	•	Sean: It is of the upmost importance to recognize that this decision does not exist in a vacuum, it has implications. An increase, decrease, and staying the same mean something. THe nominal difference is relatively not important, but we need to treat all groups the same. 
	•	PQ
	•	Objection
	•	Rescinded. 
	•	Bella: Obviously this conversation is getting pretty heated. I think that we need to show flexibility within Senate. We are all students, mistakes happen, and student groups improve. Ultimately, they are just trying to do their job and do a good job for campus. 
	•	Sean: I 100% agree with that and that’s where you are coming from. We are not anti-student groups - we love Northwestern programming and student groups. We are just trying to look out for the rights of all student groups. We do allow that flexibility for failure, that is why the limits and stipulations of misconducts are flexible and are not all financial. Think about what makes this event unique? Why should they get this over any other student group that had issues with an event?
	•	12-8-7, passes. 
	•	Concludes funding. 
	•	New Business: SR1415-05: Make Election Day Voter Registration Permanent in Illinois
	•	Kevin: Politics falls under what CRC does. 
	•	Archie: Just to reiterate our resolution is to make same day registration permanent in Illinois. Historically, Illinois has the lowest voter turnout in the midwest. One solution is to allow people to register on the same day at the polls. Three other states, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota have same day and 10% of their votes go. 5,900 people registered on the same day in Illinois’s same day pilot program. 
	•	Simran: In the last election cycle it boosted turnout rates. There is currently a bill that just passed in the House today and it is now in the Senate. It would be great if Northwestern could show student support since it is relevant to students. 
	•	Motion to move to old business. 
	•	Passes. 
	•	Moira: What exactly is the resolution’s purpose? 
	•	Archie: It’s a collective voice of Northwestern students that we are supporting the same day registration. It’s showing support to the state legislature. 
	•	Wendy: Were there any mishaps? 
	•	Kevin: Mainly demand, but that could be corrected in the next cycle by adding more locations. 
	•	Will: From what I’ve heard from people who voted in Chicago, it was a disaster in terms of the application. I’m not saying it couldn’t happen in the future, but I don’t think it increased voter turnout that much. It feels very partisan to me. There are tons of opportunities to register to vote. 
	•	Lauren: What was the number of people who registered and what was total turnout? 
	•	Kevin: The program was just 6000, but it was also only in Cook County. 
	•	Daniel: Students who were registered during Wildcat Welcome were often registered wrong and they could not have voted if they had not been able to re-register on the day. 
	•	Passes
	•	Old  Business: SR1415-04 Flyering: Not So Fly
	•	Ground flyering is wasteful and not very effective.
	•	Alec: We are supporting the ASG exec board’s decision and encourages Northwestern’s student groups to do the same.
	•	Lauren: Jaime, what do you think about this as PR Chair? 
	•	Jaime: In general I have been trying to move away from ground flyering and it is not intrinsic to PR. 
	•	Moira: Why did you decide to make in not binding? 
	•	Alec: The exec board already made the decision and as a committee we are still looking into alternatives. We may take that step when we have a good alternative to present to student groups. 
	•	Unanimously passes.  
	•	Old  Business: SL1415-08 Off-Campus Elections
	•	This is changing the election process to align it with the presidential election. 
	•	Korri: Will there be an option for people who don’t have a preference? 
	•	Yes there can be. 
	•	Motion to amend. 
	•	Changing the first be it enacted clause to 20 signatures. And also adding an option for studying abroad or co-opping students.
	•	Chris: I’d like to motion to make it more catch all. 
	•	Passes. 
	•	PQ
	•	Passes unanimously.

	•	Executive Board Reports

	•	General Order:  Sustainability Vice President Christina Cilento 
	DivestNU, the coal divestemnt movenet. I’m one of the student leaders of this. this is the first international coal and fossil fuel divestment movement. We’re working on taking out the 17 million $ in coal investments. We don’t konw exactly about any of this, because there’s no transparency. Tech, Norris will be able to send letters to the board of trustees to ask them to be more transparent and not close the issue of divestment. We’re going to send all the letters to the head of the investment subcommittee. we’re going to be at swift at 7 to put coal on a mock trial and people are going to be sharing their experiences with coal. 

General order: study abroad opportunities
	Hi guys, i’m here to talk about the IPD office. for summer fall and year round programs. we arrange a variety of study abroad options, from research to academic. I’m here to talk about financing opportunities. obviously it’s very expensive. Recently IPD has received generous donations to allow us to mitigate the cost. obviously you can use financial aid, but the only caveat is that if you use NU financial aid you can’t use financial aid for another quarter. there is outside scholarship money as well there is diversity abroad program these programs are on the I{PD website and are easily accessible. IPD also has a host of different scholarships based on merit and financial need. Those are all on the website and i have flyers. Thru buffet center and GES institute. the point of this was to tell you the chances of studying abroad drastically increase. 80% of the costs will be mitigated. Questions?
	New Business: SR1415-08 Northwestern Divestment Resolution
	Dana: would the author come up?
	*introductions* 
	A roadmap of what i’m doing today: clearing up what this bill does, and then telling you why you should support it.
	THe first and most important part of this resolution is the transparency clause. Northwestern lags behind its peer schools in its lack of transp[arency in its investemts. Yales et al have socially responsible investment policies that prevent investment. Northwestern does not release its investments and the fact that we can’t se what’s invested. But northwestern has to take as tance on a specific issues: the vilation of palestinian human rights. but htis isn’t a one time thing. We need to make sure that northwestern doesn’t reinvest in promlem companies. 
	So having established what this does, lets establish why you should support. Nobody disputes the facts on the ground: palesitne is occupied and human rightsare being violated. The Wall, gaza blockade, buldozing homes. These human rights violations are unacepptable. You as students are complicit becasue we are part of an institution that is complicit. We need to leverage our power to make sure we are making respoinsible choices. Maing the most money in the right way. if we dont take a stand against the moral . I dont want to pait the conficlt as anything but complex. but what isn’t complex is human rights violations. these are black and white. the interational communit yhas decided that there are some things that are unacceptable no matter what. Abstaining si no better than a no vote and apathy ….
Dana: now we will start a 10 min q&a
Q: why are they focusing on israel?
A: idk why does anyone focus on anything? this resolution si in response to the 2005 BDS call by palestinian orgs. We are standing in solidarity with them because they asked us to. Palesitne is the common denominator between all these companies, but all companies commit human rights abousees elsewhere.
i also want to add that wea re saying this is the only human rigths violation we care about. we chose this because we stand in solidarity and hope you do.
Q: why did you feel the need to g obeyoud transparency?
A: we feel uneasy when the investment officer says hes’t rying th o mae the most money. There are compelxities in this confict 
Q: doesnt divestment deter peace talks and demonize israel?
A: No. this is about the companies. those who are committing human rights violations. thsi does not affect peace talks.
Q: BDS has 3 clauses: Ending the Istaeli occupation of arab lands
A: we intermept this as ending the illegal settlements and blockade. and ensuring that israel treats all citizens equally. they can’t vilate anypne’s rights
q: why aren’t you affiliated with a one or two state solutoin?
A: we can’t, as students, demand a solution for people over seas. our focius is ending our complicity.
Q: I am confused. Whe there is signs all over campuses … ????
A: NU divest does not believe that zionism= racism
Q: why was it written on the sidewalks?
A: it was written by an individual affiliated by NUdivest
Q: don’t you think this could marginalize students who support israel? 
A; paelstinian studensta already feel marginalixzed.
Q”: do we know if NU invests in these companies?
A: no but its’ likely
Q: what about dialogue?
A: we have had many informational sessions. I’d call that dialogue. I’d add that while dialouge is great it’s noting without action.
we had a great discussion on monday
Q: how do you feel about uman rights violation on the other side?
A: hamas is a terrorist organization. Isreal is a goverment. Israel’s policies don’t target hamas.
ever-expanidg borders threaten Israel’s own security. 
Q: you said you want substantive action? it’s highly unlikely that our university will divest? It’s unlikely that BDS affects israel?
A: this is not aBDS movement, we don’;t want boycott or sanctions. When we talk about divesting these companies , we are sending a message we are unwilli
Motion to extend by ten minutes: seconded
Dana:additional ten minutes
Q: in one of your enactment clauses, it says incuding but noit limited to six companies … is it just those six companies? 
A: these are the companies we are targeting right now. they are most likely to be invested now. 
Q:why can’t you divest from both sides/ condemn both sides? this resolution seems one-sided.
A: we are not saying HAMAS is good. we are not investing in HAMAS. but people are saying invest in Israel. 
Q: Because hamas is a democratically elected gov’t of Gaza, why doesn’t htis target egyptian companies that do the same thing?
A: what does it mean to stand whith anoippreseed people? it doesn’t mean we know what they need. they asked for this, 
Q: why doesn’t the resolutoin say you aren’t attached to BDS?
A: we think our resolution is pretty clear. We are not responding to the entire call. this is about 6 companies. The fact we stand in solidarity with BDS doesn’t mean we are BDS.
Q: yo uback up your claims with th eUN … the UN says palestine IS a state.
A: a state can define its borders, defend its people … collect taxes! all orgs say israel is violationg human rights
Q: why do student groups support you?
A: theres a lot of dialogue that exemplity human rights these things have in common that they care about human rights and don’t want to be compict.
Q: have you talked to the administraiton?
A: no
Q: Do you think israel has a right to exist?
A: we have no political stance. We have spent countelss hours together, and we haven’t hd this conversation once because its irrellevant. 
Q: can you speak to the success of these resolutoins at other campuses?
A: yes, all of UCal schools have voted to divest. NH college has already divested. 
Q: could you talk about what makes NU divest different from other resolutions?
A:every school is different, we’ve tailored this to our student body. It’ns not a rignd organization.
oother schools have different transperance policies.
Q: YOu’ve talked a lot about the board of trustees, but what’s going to happen if this passes to the students? students have felt threatened?
A: I want to reiterate that this legislation is not BDs. this is about a universal standard of human rights. when students are made uncomfortable, it’s not ideal, but it happens. we need to recognize that the status quo makes students uncomfortambe.  these violations are being done in the name of jews everywhere, i don’t want to be complicit in this. the status quo is not some holy place where nobody is feeling uncomfortable. 
Not to offend anyone, but i don’t think that amyone’s discomfort here is comporable to palestinian experiences.
Moiton to extend 5 minutes: seconded.
Q: you seem to like the term apartheid. would you say that israel is an aparteid state?
A: israel is not the same as aparteid south africa. but there is a UN defiition and it fits.. which is what we used. We’ve actually removed it from a lot of our resolution. 
you can call it whatever you want but it’;s messed up.
Q: given that yoyu’re guessing northwestern is complicit, but we know for a fact that there are countries NU invests in like Qatar with human rights issues.
A: this isn’t the only issue anyone should care about. This is about solidarity. the people of qatar haven’t said anyting. 
Q: Given that these companies operate in israel, isn’t it simplistic to say that we aren’t divesting from israel?
A: we’re divesting from companies whose products directly violate hman rights. 
Q:On ASG committees we talk a lot about peer institutions, what are they doing?
A: i don’t konw of a list of peer institutoins thathas a specific term, but i used a list of schools with similar academic caliber. Columbia, Yale, UCal schools.
Quesiton period is over.

	•	Old Business: Supporting the Real Food Challenge Campus Commitment and Real Food Calculator
Now we are moving to old business.
Renee: Almost everone eats food from sodexo. we partake in industiralized system that exploits the earth, environment, workers, and our health. it creates dead zones, large scale growers have been convicted for slavery for exploiting workers. this resloution stands against this. most organic farms pay above minimum wage. northwerster throws its wight behind sustainability. peer institution have committed to sourcing Real Food, pioneering a path. this will enchance the dining experience. wider variety of food sources. also heathier. dining hall workers can learn new skills preparing food. a committment to 20% real food by 2020. a billion dollars would shift to sustainable food if everybody did it. $5,590  for a standard meal system. we need everyone: students, dining service workers we are going to redirect our food system towards workers who respect the environment.
Dana: now we move into question period.
Q: (jake) have you been in talks with the school with what this would cost? it’s already very expensive. What extra would we spend?
Answer: we’re starting a dialogue  - looking for other ways to cut costs - cut food waste. Sodexo buys too much food and it gets wasted. thers’ a lot of space for cost saving mechanisms, theres’ a lot of room to talk about htat. we can cut down on transportation costs. working with the university will get us more involved. 
Q: can we add a clause about abandoning the resolution if costs go too high?
A: the thing is, the majority of schools didn’t raise costs
Chris: the system is optimized as it is. at sodexo’s end, we have a meal plan that is optomized. 
Dana: reminder that the resolution is not binding. Adding a clause doesn’t ensure that costs don’t go up for students. 
A: we are also 100% in favor of not raising prices, not that we think it needs to be a separate clause. 
Q: what kind of discussions have you had with the university?
A: the first step of committing is showing a baseline survey, this only involves Sodexo. we just started the baseline survey. 
Q: what is the baseleine survey?
A: gives us a sense of where we are right now. in terms of sodexo’s purchasing.
Q: how long have you been working on this?
A: since august.
Q: What is this resoltion going to do in terms of helping your discussion with sodexo?
A: it will demonstrate student support. It’s a big deal.
End quesiton period, go into debate. time for a con.
Con: I wanted to speak because i think the facts are skewed. they’re presenting something as if there aren’t consequences. something has to give. either food quantity, higher costs, administrative costs. Iv’e worked with sodexo and i think this is a noble cause, but something will give. we can’t do it and expect there to be no cost. Iv’e worked on food waste and dining hall hours. like chris said, it’s highly optimized - there’s not that much waste. if we do impement this, there will be consequences. Chris: i was saying the system might NOT be optimized. 
Pro: (Moira) if im not mistaken, sodexo said there may be some budget loophole open, so it’s plausible that food costs might not go up. Cornell’s food costs didn’t go up. Saying that food costs might go up might is not the way to look at htings. Things are expensive not because of activists, it’s because of companies exploiting students. if we were to pass this challenge, we would potentially see a world with no sodexo . cost is a legitimate problem ,but it’s not activist’s fault. 
Con: one issue i have is that some things are oversimplified. i don’t think that switichng from organic food is going to be all that sustainable. it’s much less efficient in terms of land use. A university in suburban chicago might not be optimized to find organic food. What is “locally sourced food?” I’m not fully convinced that organic food is substantially healthier. 
Pro: i think one of the main issues is you are conflating econoimic efficinecy with sustainability. just because organic farms aren’t economically efficient doesn;t mean they aren’t sustainable. soil erosion in iowa. the economic repercussions of environmental degradation is catastrophic. we’re looking well beyond 2020. looking long-term, efficient for generations to come. 
Con: I want to clarify what i said prior, to reiterate my experiences with Sodexo. they were impossible to work with. I was trying to bring better food! I want organic, fresher food. but the narrative we are putting forward is that we can do that with no consequences, and that’s untrue. Sodexo is good at reducing waste. we can have a conversation about whether we shoudl buy food from a for-profit corporation. without wholesale changes to the system, if we change this there will be an effect and it’s naive to think that we wont.
Pro: people have made it seem like this is a radical change, but we’re only looking for 20%. right now we’re proably in the mid- teens.
I want to adress a lot of the food price points. i was privvy to some research on our dining hall costs. they’re astronomically high. i have no belief that sodexo is doing this correctly . we should trust the activists rather than Sodexo
we as students have seen that sodexo reduce waste does not reduce food costs. 
	•	Old Business: SL1415-14:Name Changes and Code Cleanup 
Now our last piece of business. 
These are mostly changes to the code, mostly stuff that’s outdated. lot of grammatical and sytactial changes, and allowing the parlimentarian to make those changes. codificaiton fo th eanalytincs committee, removing the operations committee, removiong VP tech, making it Director of Tech. a coupe of otehr random things, like making Sustainability VP part of the cabinet. there’s one amendment thanks to Isaac. it’s that B status finance committee doesn’t have the authority to give out funding since all funding will go thru the A status, so i fixed that to give B status the authority. 
Motion to amend to the current document: seconded. 
PQ: seconded.
Vote to amend: passed. 
Back to talking about the original piece. 
Grace: what happented to T-status?
That’s not a thing anymore. all students who want to start a new student group go to CSI
Clarification: people were finding that all the B and T status groups couldn’t manange their time. now they get the attention they need.
Q: i’ve heard talk of changin the cheif fo staff selection process. why isnt’ that adressed?
A: because it hasn’t been brought up. 
Q: chief of staff selection [process has been messed up, what gives?
A: it has a bunch of contradictions. we weren’t doing it by the rules. 
Dana”: the intention was to have CoS selected in teh winter, and it was an oversight.
Q: is this just officially codifiying it?
A: yes.
Moving into debate:
Motion to amend: 
[linked to amendment]
My amendment was someting that was discussed, it chenges the selection timeline for CoS to spring quarter, but not ath the same time. One of th eCoS’ jobs was to oversee selectoin comittees and the transision process. it’s better to make them do that at the end of the term rather than 5 weeks into their term. the only precenemt for CoS selected in winter is SGVP et al which are “service positions” thsi is more of an internal management position. this will give the prez the greatest say. 
Q: why is this an amendment instead of a different bill, esp. since you anre not in favor of moving to old business?
A; this was discussed a lot before, and it was my understanding that this was going to be in this bill before it was going before rules. The selection process begins next week. 
Clarification: we didnt have things queite right for new businiess.

Roll Call and Adjournment



Northwestern University
Associated Student Government
Meeting of the Senate
February, 11, 2014
 
	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes. (Audio: here)
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	General Order: Student Group Senate Seat Apportionment 
	•	General Order:  Social Inequalities and Diversity Requirement 
	•	Austin: We are from the Accessibility and Inclusion committee. Just to give you an overview, currently there is a petition going around calling for WCAS to conider a US focus to their Social Inequalities requirement. WCAS has been doing this so far with very little student involvement and awareness. If ASG’s stance is it should be US focused and right now they are considering an international focus. 
	•	Amol: In the last couple months, faculty has pushed to have international classes fulfill this proposal. The initial proposal was to have the class focus on social inequalities that relate back to what is in our own backyard. 
	•	Austin: That’s the ASG stance and definitely not the stance you have to take. There is going to be forum and we would love your opinion. 
	•	Old Business: SR1415-08 Northwestern Divestment Resolution (note: I missed a lot, including names, which is why sometimes there are dashes instead of names. Additionally, I misspelled names! If you would like me to correct anything in here, please email asg-parliamentarian@u.northwestern.edu) 
	•	Authorship speech: 
	•	Imtisal: It is amazing to see how many people the NUDivest team has mobilized and how many discussions we’ve started. I am here because I support NUDivest and because it matters. In this speech we will clear up misconceptions, tell you why we are here, and why you should care. The NUDivest resolution is not BDS because it is impossible to be BDS. BDS is a call from Palestinian society, they have asked us not be complicit. We are not endorsing a political decision. The one state and two state debate is irrelevant and derailing, because it is premature. Before that debate can happen, we need to address human rights. The oppression of the Palestinians is linked to the oppression of people all over the year. Now please listen to what NU Divest is. 
	•	These companies are reaping the benefit of a system that violates human rights. Human PAckard technology was used today to limit the movement of Palestinians. Today G4S benefitted from Palestinian prisoners. It will be a Caterpillar bulldozer that will crush the homes of Palestinians. This past summer, hundreds of Palestinian people died because of weapons provided by Lockeed Martin and Boeing. Senators, this is about divesting from human rights violations. 
	•	Noah: We understand the result of this is going to be limited in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On this campus, Northwestern is complicit in the oppression of Palestinian people. Senators, it is key to see how many people care about this. We want to propose a small amendment to clarify. 
	•	Motion to previous question. 
	•	Passes. 
	•	We are now in line for question period. 
	•	Nathan: You have said it’s not in line with BDS because it’s not a movement. What part do you not support? 
	•	Noah: We are only talking about divestment, not boycotts or sanctions. 
	•	Grant: When would the correct time for peace talks? 
	•	Noah: Peace talks have been the status quo and nothing has happened. Divestment is a way to uphold human rights, not a political solution. 
	•	Julia: What does it mean to be a grassroots movement for you? 
	•	Noah: Our support and organizing comes from Northwestern students. We haven’t has any sort of national organization telling us what to do. 
	•	Jonathan: Did you write the resolution yourselves?
	•	Imtisal: We collaborated as students. 
	•	Scott: You say you’re not in favor of one state or two state, but in Norris there was a picture with only one color. 
	•	Noah: We weren’t talking about a one state solution, we were just painting the land and green is a normal way to color land. 
	•	Mckayla: Point of clarification, there was a palestinian map next to the picture. 
	•	Christina: What does it mean to divest operationally as a university? 
	•	Noah: It involves not investing in mutual funds with these companies. It also involves socially i
	•	Parag: What are the next steps if this passes? 
	•	Noah: We will be talking to the administration. 
	•	Nick: Have you talked to the administration this far?
	•	Imtisal: We have not yet and that’s because we wanted to get student support first. 
	•	Jacob: Why not just call for transparency, since you say that’s the most important part? 
	•	Noah: Without student pressure, schools do not divest from companies profiting of of Palestinian human rights. 
	•	Corey: Does supporting Palestinian rights require political action? 
	•	Imtisal:
	•	Amy: Why not go for transparency first if we don’t know if we’re involved? 
	•	Noah: There has been confirmation that the chances are practically 0 that we aren’t.
	•	Noah: Does your resolution call for addressing palestinian violation of israeli rights? 
	•	Imtisal: This calls for divestment from state sanctioned violence. 
	•	Noah: Northwestern is not and cannot be invested in Hamas. 
	•	Motion to extend question period by 5 minutes. 
	•	Elliott: Why did NUDivest not reach out to J Street U, Hillel, or other organizations before this? 
	•	Noah: We did reach out to J Street and assumed the others would not support us if they didn’t. 
	•	Josh: Clarification, Noah reached out to me after they started their campaign, not after. 
	•	Nathan: Explicitly, what is not in line with BDS
	•	Noah: This resolution does not call for Boycotts or Sanctions. 
	•	Rachel: What about all the other elements other than those three words? 
	•	Imtisal: That question is not relevant. 
	•	Why did the organizations that put their name on your resolution support you?
	•	Noah: We’ve seen that nobody lives single issue lives. We stand in solidarity to each other while searching for justice. 
	•	Jake: If divestment is the furthest political statement, can you talk about your use of the word Apartheid. 
	•	Noah: We are using the UN definition of the word, not comparing to South Africa. 
	•	Gideon: Northwestern has  very diverse portfolio, why aren’t you targeting other issues?
	•	Noah: this plays into our issue of transparency and in theory that would be addressed. This is the one we are talking about right now. 
	•	Nadia: How are these organizations involved in this summer’s violence in Gaza
	•	-: All these companies are complicit in one way or another. Specifically Boeing and Lockheed Martin manufacture helicopters. We saw a massive amount of death this summer and as students we were shocked by that. It’s another reason why this vill is so important. 
	•	Joe: I know you can’t mention all the groups, but can you tell any of them? I couldn’t find them. 
	•	Serene: Kairos which is a Christian Palestinian group, Packbe about the academic and cultural groups, etc. 
	•	Rachel: You said this will have limited effects but what is the ultimate goal. 
	•	Noah: In my authorship speech I addressed this. To say it will have no effect, is a bit of a stretch. Northwestern can contribute to support. And there will be tangible difference on our campus. 
	•	-: Why are you not calling for a political solution? 
	•	Noah: We believe that a political solution cannot be achieved without a solid foundation
	•	-: How can you justify chalking like Zionism = murder? 
	•	Noah: The individual who wrote Zionism = racism does not reflect the beliefs of NUDivest. 
	•	Isaac: Motion to amend. The amendment is right after the last amendment add: “Whereas,  passage of this resolution constitutes a response to the divestment component of the call;” This resolution as currently written and amended is about human rights violations. With this amendment hopefully the views of this body will be even more clear. 
	•	Nathan: Simply removing one line is insufficient to separate NUDivest from BDS. NUDivest has linked itself for BDS and even with the amendment, BDS will declare victory. After a similar amendment was added at Berkeley, BDS still said Berkeley was a victory. Option 3 in the BDS handbook is what this amendment is. Is the signal we want to send one that explicitly calls on the BDS handbook? This amendment changes nothing. If this passes, it should be clear what it is, a firm support of BDS. 
	•	Moira: I want to clear up something about what this amendment does. This is a clarifying amendment and it is not intended to change the content of what the resolution does. There are obviously a lot of continued confusion and it is intended to send a clear message on exactly what this resolution is doing. This amendment makes the intention clear and that is what we should be talking about. The previous speaker was right that it doesn’t change what the resolution is going for. 
	•	Lauren: On NUDivest’s website they say that they are in support of the movement. More importantly at Oberlin and UCLA, they took out reference to BDS and were still considered a victory for BDS. 
	•	Motion to previous question. 
	•	Passes. 
	•	Noah: We are now in line for the first con. 
	•	Mitchell: Members of ASG exec, senators, student, faculty, I speak to you as a student strongly opposed to this and a member of the coalition for peace. This debate is not about the merits of a socially responsible investment policy. We are too and there are other ways to do that. The resolution is not about taking sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict either. You need to decide whether you want Northwestern to align itself with the BDS movement. We want respect, not picking sides. If you as a Senator have any doubts about aligning us with BDS, then vote no. 
	•	FMO: In line with FMO’s media policy, we are not to be quoted or associated with anything like that until we see it. As the representative of black students on campus, we fight for the rights of minority groups. Oppression is linked across oceans. We see BDS as an important way to stop this violence. Right now is a moment of crucial solidarity. Along the history of FMO and across campus, black students have been harassed for speaking out against human rights violations. In similar ways, so have the NUDivest organizers. We are standing in solidarity with them. Consider that all oppression is connected. If you are choosing to be complicit in this oppression, you are complicit in all oppression. 
	•	Jaqueline Soria: What is the impact of passing this? We aren’t actually debating divestment. We are debating whether to ask the university for divestment. The bill does not include a call for socially responsible divestment. Additionally, Northwestern is likely invested in mutual funds that are nearly impossible to divest from. This bill is not about divestment. Activism should be about making an impact and since it is highly unlikely that Northwestern will divest, this is not the right way. The only way the campaign makes an impact is to strengthen the BDS movement. It is no step forward and a leap toward supporting BDS. 
	•	Serene: I have given love and time to Northwestern and for the first time I am asking for NU to love me back. Today I am referring to Palestinians as we and all parts of me tell em to call for this. If you are willing to allow companies to treat Palestinians in Palestine like this, would you let them treat me this way? 
	•	Josh Schwartz: Framing it’s campaign as standing on the right side of history, NUDivest is making us choose which human rights to support. If we allow this partisan climate to persist, it will a long time before we can make progressive change. Extremism and divisiveness is not what we need. What legacy do we want to leave behind? In my eyes, the key is through dialogue. Not the debate we saw hosted by PU, sustained dialogues. If that is not possible, then that’s fine, but we need to try. We risk putting a major obstacle. We are the perfect candidates to model coexistence, please give us a chance to move forward. 
	•	Imtisal: I’d like to cede my time to Serene. 
	•	Serene: We have been working for peace, why won’t you wait for us to save you? Palestinians asked, they are the ones suffering, not you. It is Israel that is the one state. When peace means the status quo and you refuse to be moved by your peer’s call for you to listen, it is a peace that suffocates. Israel asked the US gov for millions of dollars for support. You give Israel all of this if you like it or not. All Palestinians ask for is your support. Will you ask that I throw the Palestinian part of me back to the margins? 
	•	What is the relationship between this and the ASA statement last year? 
	•	Imtisal: There is no relation. Our resolution has nothing about an academic boycott. Your confusion might be that SJP did hold events on that. 
	•	Scott Spicer: This resolution places blame just on Israel by ignoring facts and context. NUDivest says you don’t need to know the context and frames the issue as only Israeli’s fault. Almost a thousand Israeli casualties occurred from suicide bombings on busses. Cities close to gaza had only 30 seconds before knowing when they would be hit. Instead, vote for a bilateral process. 
	•	Motion to extend by half an hour. 
	•	Second. 
	•	Ruba: I am a Palestinian. This is the single most important topic in my life. My good friend Serene is always telling me to speak the truth even if my voice shakes. It is rare that for ASG that we are asked to humanize a people. You have peers in this room that are familiar with this oppression. Some of us can list the year our family lost the right to return to our home. Some of us can tell you when we became refugees. I understand you may not. You do know Northwestern. You became complicit when you entered into Northwestern. Do not forget to have values is to practice them. The way you vote won’t return my family to our village or to make a group uncomfortable more than the discomfort of Palestinians. 
	•	Tamar: I want to state that I stand in a supporter of both palestine and Israel. Voting yes will link the Northwestern campus to the BDS movement. If this passes, our name will be added to the BDS victories. Palestinians like Israelis are divided in this issue and NUDivest should not speak for all Palestinians. You have the responsibility for deciding what Northwestern students support. Palestinian writers and activist speak against BDS, because negative campaigns just. There is no way to make this decision without a political decision. 
	•	Daniel: What are the consequences of NU being counted as a victory. 
	•	Tamar: The BDS has made several statements that they don’t respect Israel’s right to exist. 
	•	Ruba: Can you speak for who makes decisions to BDS? 
	•	Noah: Some supporters don’t support a two state and some do. 
	•	Ruba: If today was truly rational, I wouldn’t have to discuss human rights. Palestinians have been for decades robbed of their voices. How can I be expected to share the forced silence within me in two minutes? Your voice and vote has the power to dismiss us or support us. As with every struggle in the past, there are some of us who see the suffering and some who don’t. 
	•	Anabelle: I can stand here and tell you about the civilians of that have been living under threat of bombs. The only difference in the death toll is because of Israel’s defense. I am not going to pretend that Israel is the victim, but I’m not going to say the Palestinians are either. Voting for divestment is pointing fingers. The beauty of Northwestern is that it encourages its students to listen to both sides. The divestment movement rejects everything NU is about, it sets the precedence for divisiveness.  
	•	Parag: I firmly believe that senators should vote in favor of this. First because it neutralizes the narrative. Standing in solidarity with Palestinians allow that to happen. This resolution allows us to open up a space for discourse. All this is asking for us to to vote in favor of a resolution against human rights. With BDS, not everyone in that movement thinks the same thing. All this asks of us is to recognize suffering and not be complicit. 
	•	How should we look at the resolution?
	•	Parag: Look at it first and foremost whether NU should divest and then look at the context. I don’t see the negative outcome, because I see this as a win for Palestinians not BDS. 
	•	Eli: I’d like to speak further about the connection to the global BDS movement. While they have tried to delink this from the wider movement. But in reality it is born from the BDS campaign. SJP actively promoted a boycott of Israeli academics. Additional connections between the movement can be seen in it’s sponsors. Many of whom have openly endorsed the BDS movement. The website says NUDivest supports BDS, but the leaders have clearly felt the urge to separate themselves from BDS. Passing this would make NU an unfortunate victory of the BDS movement. 
	•	Alianza: We are here and sponsored this resolution because we refuse to remain complicit in human rights violations. We understand that we don’t live single issue lives. I can’t ignore this and while my family is not Palestinian, my family that has immigrated from Mexico has seen similar things.  We see these connections, so it is hard for me to see why people can’t see the meaning behind this movement and choose to rely on technicalities. 
	•	Charlie: It is critical to understand that a two state solution is the only way to achieve peace. NUDivest and BDS contradict this. The complete success of BDS requires the dissolution of Israel. Boycotting, Divesting and imposing sanctions on Israel just pushes us farther away from peace. Both sides have blood on their hands. BDS prolongs the conflict. 
	•	Piotr: I have been around this campus for four years. I came to NU to be a teacher. I live to support my students and it pains me that my education is complicit in my Palestinian students’ oppression.  One of my mentees travelled to Palestine, but were stopped at a check point miles from their family. 
	•	Motion to extend by 30 minutes. 
	•	Grant: I want to take a step back and look at the long term goal of Northwestern and ASG. If the resolution creates more harm than good, you should not pass it. ASG tonight must vote on whether having NU take away its funds will fix the problem. Not only does NUDivest not find an answer to any human rights violation, it pushes people farther away. The movement impedes peace and pushes everyone away from peace. 
	•	Dania: To all of you who are telling us to dialogue, I say your process silences us. The long arm of Israeli violence follows us past the occupation. It erases the physical and structural violence Palestinians feel every day. 
	•	Joe: We’re here tonight to decide whether we want to severe ties with one country in the middle east. Not the country where we have a campus. I can’t convince to make the connection between this and BDS, even if it walks and talks like BDS and until an hour ago mentioned and aligned itself with BDS. We need to first call for transparency and then take specific action. 
	•	Hagar: I am not Palestinian and would like to apologize that people are speaking on your behalf. I’m sorry you have to sit here and listen to people say what is best for you. We experience discomfort any time we bring up something controversial. To feel like your character and beliefs are questioned by this is to align yourself with oppression. Do not silence us. Do not send us back to the margins of this campus. Do not wait for the people of color to stop talking so you can go back to your comfort zone. I challenge you to listen. I challenge you to leave your comfort zone. I also recognize my own privilege. 
	•	How does bringing up qatar help if you already say the occupation is a problem?
	•	Joe: I’m pointing out a double standard. By pointing out one country, the adminstration is less likely to hear. 
	•	Jeff: I just want to share one piece of wisdom by someone who has been able to ensure peace in an area. Anwar Sadat: “there is a psychological barrier between us…”
	•	Christina: Divestment is an important place to start. For coal, we don’t think we’re going to stop climate change, but it’s an important step. Many Palestinians do not have access to clean running water. Caterpillar is also responsible for taking down olive trees. It is also an occupation of land and resources. Environmental injustices and human rights violations are not okay with me. 
	•	McKayla: I would like to address a few false accusations in this resolution. South Africans do align with the Palestinians, but they do not appreciate it being called Apartheid. In Israel, minorities are guaranteed rights under the law. The Northwestern Coalition of Peace fervently opposed the occupation, but this effort emboldens extremists on both sides. With the divestment campaign for South Africa, there was a direct relationship with the South African government, which is lacking in Israel. All this allows is for ASG to absolve itself from its responsibility for peace.   
	•	Isabel: I am here to tell my story because it is left out. I have family in Israel and if I thought this put their lives in danger, I would not support this. My jewish family knows what it is like to be marginalized, which makes me even more passionate about this. Times are too desperate to wait around and talk about peace. Senators, you have the chance to make history today. 
	•	Motion to extend by 30 minutes. 
	•	Ariella: NUDIvest has asked for support in the name of human rights. I do not want to oppose my fellow students, but I feel like I need to. The Coalition for Peace thinks a two state solution is the best way to find peace. I can’t support NUDivest because of its connection with BDS. We need partners and storytelling. 
	•	Eric: I want to address some of the arguments the opposition has made. First, I’d say that this is not mutually exclusive with challenging other oppressive regimes. Second, investment is already taking a side. If you don’t like taking a side, support divestment. Dialogue has been the status quo for decades, because Israel has the whole power. That’s decades of inaction. They want a slow process, but what we have right now is no process. We need divestment to shake things up. Dialogue means dialogue for a very specific group of people right now. 
	•	Meredith: I am worried our campus is divided beyond repair. We need to wipe the slate clean and start over. Voting no does not mean you support or oppose any part of this resolution. It could mean multiple things. 
	•	Petros: I am not Palestinian and I can’t speak for Palestinian students, because they can and should speak for themselves. As a gay man at NU, the queer community has often been dehumanized. These corporate actions still don’t compare to the action against Palestinians. 
	•	Will: It is a discussion about human rights, but this is really about vilifying companies. Lockheed Martin makes weapons, but it also makes defense systems. I don’t want to endanger our soldiers. 
	•	Sarah: I am a lesbian, but my struggles are not the same. Israel is the only country in the middle east that supports queer people. 
	•	Nora: Hatred becomes internalized if people stay complicit. I support the divestment. 
	•	Eric: Israel consistently denies amnesty to queer palestinians and have blackmailed queer palestinians saying they would out them if they do not conform. Queer rights for whom? 
	•	Josh: I come to this issue because of my upbringing and experience. I learned about the power of activism and felt the moral obligation. There is an occupation and it is happening in my name. That what brings me to the coalition for peace. Activists have historically disagreed and I think the conversation we are having is missing that point. This should not be a conversation about Israel vs. Palestine, but about different forms of activism. Campaigns like this gives us a false yes or no. 
	•	Noah: Can you walk me through divestment makes your activism difficult? And what is your form of activism? 
	•	Josh: I think a lot of that has said already, but I want to lift up what Jacqueline said. The only substantial impact of this resolution would be to lend credibility to the BDS movement. We need to have an honest conversation about what this resolution is. It’s not about funding the occupation, but rather is this an action that would help end the occupation. We need to look at the root of the issue. It’s not that we don’t have a two state solution yet because it is impossible, but because we have gotten super close but haven’t quite gotten there, because the political will isn’t quite there. Our analysis is that the one state implications of the BDS movement, it does not move political will in the way that we want. 
	•	Lauren: How does BDS lend itself to a one state solution? 
	•	Josh: My primary work is not about BDS. It is about ending the occupation. The calls of BDS and the movement’s goals are inconsistent with the actualizations of the issue. I don’t want to overgeneralize, I understand that there isn’t a president. My problem is they don’t make a large enough distinction between the occupation and Israel. 
	•	-:I’d like to commend the Plex-Seabury senator for asking members to vote. I would have appreciated something similar in my residence hall. What side is more political? Removing our investment is neutral. Our responsibility is to critically analyze our complicity in this. 
	•	-: For those who are liberally blabbing about dialogue, where were you when Northwestern students were harassed for standing up and for their race and culture? I have seen predominantly privileged communities talking about dialogue. 
	•	Motion to vote. 
	•	Objections. 
	•	Motion to recess. 8 minutes. 
	•	Motion to limit debate to 11:30. 
	•	Motion withdrawn. 
	•	Motion to limit debate to 11:45. 
	•	Wendy: I think this is one of the few spaces where we have both sides. I think it’s beneficial for senators who are trying to decide what to vote. 
	•	Amy: I think we’ve reached the point where things are redundant. 
	•	Moira: I don’t think both sides are redundant. I think we all expected this to take a long time. A lot of students have poured a lot of their time and energy into this campaign and to limit the amount people get to talk, I think that is disrespectful. 
	•	Motion withdrawn. 
	•	Olivia: How would you address concerns of anti-semitism if this were to pass? 
	•	Noah: I don’t think that was a response to the resolution. That person already was anti-semitic. This resolution does not make them anti-semitic. 
	•	Rachel: I think we are all here because we care deeply about the suffering of Israelis and Palestinians. The only means to be able to do this is through a two state solution. There is no disagreement that NU should align itself with human rights, but is misrepresentative to frame BDS as the only way to achieve human rights. We ask that you Senators are not swayed by this rhetoric of human rights. Relieving Palestinian suffering should not mean shifting suffering to Israelis. It is deceptive and manipulative. 
	•	Anisa: I come from an African American father and a half Palestinian half Dominican mother. I have heard their stories and witnessed the activism of my extended family. My cousin’s poetry has touched people. I remember my mother’s pride when I was accepted into Northwestern. I do not want her pride to end because the university is complicit. 
	•	Jacob: This resolution has been characterized as making Northwestern neutral. I think it is very clear that this is a very one sided resolution. Will this actually bring peace? Peace is the only way justice will be achieved. You have to have trust on both sides if you are ever going to solve a conflict. Israel has legitimate fear of countries and while at Northwestern we can’t bolster trust, we could lessen it with this resolution. 
	•	Dania: My family has been oppressed for 67 years. My family’s village no longer exists, but the idea still does. My father has been banned from returning since he was 18 for protesting. I had a gun pointed at me when I was 8 at a checkpoint when I tried to get to my mother’s house.  At least stop silencing my Palestinian voice.  
	•	Tina: We have discussed why the two state solution is the only solution and now I am going to speak to why BDS hurts that. BDS makes no distinction between the settlements and Israel. This resolution is not in line with self-determination. 
	•	Motion to extend by 30 minutes. 
	•	Amar: I am Palestinian. My family is from the West Bank, but it could be worse, we could have settled in the 40% of the land that has been destroyed. Why should Goliath look to help David when he could benefit himself? Our movement is a way to hold these firms accountable and reach a state where we can have peace talks. If you are anti-divest don’t speak for the Palestinians. 
	•	Nathan: My time in Israel confirmed my thought that the occupation needs to end. I was saddened by the nostalgia people had of peace, memory of something that was not coming. The reason for their sadness was extremism has ruined the possibility of peace. This resolution is connected to BDS, which is not the way to peace. 
	•	Cynthia: I am speaking as a Chicana student in support of this resolution. This is for my Palestinian brothers and sisters - I love you even if Northwestern doesn’t. This is about our survival, not just campus politics. To the students who get mad about our solidarity, you also appropriate us. You say we’re divisive, but we build bridges. 
	•	Nathaniel: The language of human rights is often used to manipulate. There are historical examples that serve as a reminder to analyze a situation before jumping in. The opposition wants to win a symbolic victory, but who would it be a victory for? It would be a victory for BDS, not Palestinians. Their act of placing the entire blame on Israel is not conducive to peace. As Israel and Jordan have proved, working around common interests can lead to peace. 
	•	Motion to previous question. 
	•	Objection. 
	•	Alec: After conversations with some people, the general consensus is people pretty much know how they’re going to vote. We want to hear everyone, but it’s not constructive to continue to sit here when we know how to vote. 
	•	Noah: What we’re talking about right now is not just about how Senators are voting. This is a space where people who are marginalized can speak. To previous question does a disservice to them and to yourself. 
	•	Tom: as a sub in senator, that kind of logic is against the antithesis of what you should be doing. This is unprecedented and we need to continue this dialogue. 
	•	Nehaarika: While Senate and this democratic speech is valuable, it is not the best place for dialogue. This is about a vote and our purpose is to make a decision. 
	•	Ronak: Saying you are ready to vote when you’re not all directly elected is insulting. 
	•	The motion fails. 
	•	Angel: Before coming to NU I could not have pointed out occupied Palestine on a map. I left my dorm room this morning and will be able to get back. I cannot say that about my undocumented friend. I cannot choose to answer the Palestinian call, but I must. I’d like to cede the rest of my time to a moment of silence. 
	•	Jonathan: Do you consider Israel to be the homeland of the jewish people? 
	•	Angel: I don’t know,
	•	Jake: What would your thoughts be on a resolution on something against Elbit systems in general. 
	•	Angel: You fuck with one you fuck with them all. 
	•	-: We’ve heard a lot of painful experiences but not to Israelis. My sister, my triplet sister will call me every day, crying about rockets falling. I would chalk it up to war and then one time she called me about her fiancee and how he was missing. He ended up being alive, but only because he wasn’t quite close enough. I do not want to marginalize everyone, but to show that pain is felt by more than one side. This resolution only speaks to one person’s pain. 
	•	Aman: Justice would look like me. I’m from the Gaza strip. We did not ethnically cleanse an area and then claim it as ours. I’m not opposed to the idea of judaism, but I am for equality for everyone. 2200 Palestinians were killed in the Gaza strip this summer. I lost six family members this family. My cousin was killed with 6 american made bullets. 40% of my home town was completely demolished. I can go into detail about the terror and all the things that could lead to me being a monster, but I am telling you to please divest. 
	•	Jake: I am not against human rights. I don’t think anyone in here is. Divestment will not lead to peace. The only thing that will lead to a solution is two states. 
	•	Motion to extend debate by half an hour. 
	•	NUCHR: We support NUDivest and to eliminate Northwestern’s complicity. We see it as our duty to know where our money is going. We think the movement presents us with a critical choice. We are not a single issue organization. We bring together delegates from all over the country. We understand that human rights are nuanced, but we cannot ignore the fact that Palestinians’ rights have been violated. Discussing human rights in Palestine is not exclusive and co-opting another place’s human rights violations to limit the rights of another group is wrong. 
	•	Corey: Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions are not the endgame, but they are strategies to another goal. I used to believe that divestment could be divorced from the political reformation, but the more we claim it is a simple solution, the more self-centered we get. The treatment of Palestinians is awful, but this resolution does not have a satisfactory description of what divestment would do. BDS does do this well, but NUDivest has distanced themselves from them. 
	•	Bria: Colonialism is not dead, but people are dying at the hands of colonialism. It shouldn’t take travelling abroad, spending thousands of dollars, to understand that. Colonialism is not dead, but it has gotten very good at camouflaging itself. Oppression has made consumption it’s fuel. Our affiliation with systems that consume is more than just complicit, it is fueling the problem. To not divest would be enabling the continuation of action. We are here today with so much passion, because we are refusing to remain seated at oppression’s table. 
	•	Nicholas: The authors say this is a human rights campaign, but we all know it isn’t. 
	•	Will: Just to quickly address the colonialism argument, I think it is offensive. The jews did not come from Europe to oppress the Palestinians. They came from countries where they were kicked out. 
	•	Aman: There is a law in the Israeli institution to arrest people of color for no reason. What about the demonstrations against people of color. I don’t know what you’re talking about. Israel makes money off of racism, similar to this country. Thank god to the people who invented socialism to share these things better. You know what’s worse than colony? Supporting colony. I am frustrated that there are people who can support this. Get on the right side of justice! 
	•	Motion to vote. 
	•	Objection. 
	•	Shannon: I think we have all determined a side. It is great to have another opinion added to the collection. Our ultimate purpose is to come to a decision and I think the Senate body has come to a place. 
	•	Moira: Our responsibility is to come to a decision with all the facts. It is not harmful to stay here longer and listen to people. I don’t think there is a good argument for why we need to vote right now. We could vote right now but we do not need to. There are facts left to hear. I know people are waiting to hear. There are arguments you haven’t heard yet. 
	•	Jonathan: We’ve been here for five hours and this debate is no longer about the debate anymore. The speaker who just spoke, I wanted to ask him about whether he though Israel has the right to exist and I shouldn’t have to ask that question. 
	•	Ronak: First and foremost, our job is to be representatives of our constituents . we need to give them a voice. 
	•	Alec: I definitely acknowledge that giving people a place to share their beliefs is valuable, but I think it is not respectful to everyone’s time if people already know how they are going to vote. I asked again, is anyone undecided? Because please speak up. 
	•	Marcel: By going to a vote now, you are saying future speakers don’t matter and it marginalizes their votes. 
	•	Ruba: I also want to say, I want you to shift your focus away from us and onto other people. 
	•	Motion fails. 
	•	Ross: If this passes, no solution will be offered but a message will be sent. While Israel is far from perfect, everyone has full legal rights in Israel. As a progressive liberal, I have a problem singling out the only country with these rights. I would not answer a call of a people who supported this kind of a smear campaign. 
	•	Youssef: I’d like to begin by addressing a disturbing remark from a Senator. We have no right to draft borders, but we can respond to a call and stand in solidarity. A few other Senators mentioned that the complexity makes them uncomfortable. But it is not complex enough to justify an occupation. You have chosen the side of the oppressor. 
	•	Ruba: Motion to extend until the speakers end. 
	•	Chandra: I admire both sides, not to appear moderate, but I truly do. The past few rounds have not been traced back to the resolution and at that point it is not influencing our decision as Senators. After those opinions aren’t influencing our decisions, I don’t think this is the right forum. 
	•	Noah: I’m speaking in con, but I think that after two more speakers I would be in favor of PQ. 
	•	Motion to extend by 5 minutes.
	•	Passes.
	•	Josh Boxerman: I want to start by saying thank you to everyone who has spoken, especially people who have shared their personal stories. It’s stories like those that have gotten me into the work that I’m doing now. I think this debate should not be about whether or not we should end the occupation. This is about whether we are comfortable aligning our student body with the BDS movement at large. It is not a choice between this and silence. I am not staying silent. I have been fighting on this front for year. Just last quarter, we hosted a screening of five broken screening, we held a vigil for the lives lost, etc. This is the work that we do. Our window for action on this issue is not limited to tonight
	•	Hassan: Our freedom is not complete without the freedom of the of the Palestinians. This bill does not take rights away, but gives them to people. I ask you to stand with unions across the world and stand with universities across the country and so many others. 
	•	Maddie: Political action is the path to any meaningful change. The issue we have been talking about is human rights. I hope you are capable of recognizing the faults of Israel and the right to a jewish state. The answer to this is not divestment. If you believe if the Palestinian people have as much of a right as Israelis, which I think we should all be able to get behind, then you must acknowledge that this is a geopolitical issue. 
	•	Motion to amend. 
	•	Motion for one minute recess
	•	Motion to add “but does not reflect an endorsement of the BDS ideologies beyond the scope of the resolution;” and motion to strike “Whereas,  passage of this resolution constitutes a response to the divestment component of the call;”
	•	Daniel: Does the passage of this resolution to the support of BDS? While we cannot control the slant of extremist publications, but we can include clarifying language. 
	•	Noah: We just need two more speakers to PQ. This will cause too much debate. 
	•	Motion to PQ. 
	•	Move to a vote. 
	•	The amendment fails. 
	•	Motion to extend by four speakers. 
	•	Passes. 
	•	Julia: I will only speak to my experience as someone who has always thought about where I fit in at Northwestern. We need to address the elephant in the room, which is the difference of institutional privilege between the two groups. 
	•	Sophia: There is really only one side, which is the truth. Academics is important, but not just poli sci classes, classes that are about social inequalities. (lots of stuff I missed, sorry!)
	•	Ruba: Can you elaborate on the South Africa win? 
	•	Sofia: 30-1, not full divestment but eventually. This is about long term goals, which ASG has always been about. 
	•	Jonathan: Do you consider Jewish students to be a minority right now who felt oppression? 
	•	Sofia: I think you need to look at the difference between suffering at the center or on the margin. The two are not comparable. There are times when people do need to be uncomfortable and disrupted. 
	•	Rocio: I am speaking on behalf of Sarah Torres. I would like to say that I find this space a bit scary and I don’t know how we are going to function after this when there is a huge dichotomy here. Many people are feeling silenced here.  If we want to have a discussion about human rights, it should be about for everyone. To Sarah’s points. I disagree with the members of the queer community who are relating their experiences to the Palestinians . The leadership in Palestine imprison and kill queer people. 
	•	Stephanie: I a woman of color am ceding one minute to this white man standing next to me, because his opinion will be taken more seriously than mine. Silence is violent, it exonerates our complicity in human rights violations. Nu cannot operate on silence. There is no safety in fear. The violence of imperialism must be challenged by responding to the calls of the indigenous populations. 
	•	Erik: There is a strong discourse against NUDivest. i know as a white male I am considered more seriously. How are people shaping the discourse. When we were saying we have a fear of being aligned with BDS, that’s similar to saying gay marriage will ruin families. When we are voting on this resolution it is not just Israel or Palestine. It is about how Northwestern responds to oppression. It is the same argument in different shapes. 
	•	Joe: Before I go everyone, I want to genuinely thank you for the opportunity to hear these stories. There might be an amendment following this and removing BDS from this. If you are at all uncomfortable about BDS, stay uncomfortable. No matter what amendments you add. We don’t want to be invested in these companies, but if you phrase it targeting only one issue, you are guaranteeing the administration will not heed your call. It may feel good today and tomorrow and you may feel like you ended your complicity, but there is no future. We have to first get transparency and then we can tackle individual issues. 
	•	Petros: Motion to enter testimony from unheard individuals into the journal. 
	•	No objections. 
	•	We will now move into a secret ballot. 
	•	The motion passes. 24-22-3. 

Speeches that were not said, but were motioned to be added to the journal: 

From Melisa Stephen: 

“Hi, my name is Melisa Stephen. I'm a senior and off-campus senator, and I support NU Divest. I specifically want to talk from a perspective of feminist and queer activism and call out Sara Torres and other members of the opposition who have shown us some terrific examples of pink washing Israel in their speeches tonight.

“Pink washing” refers to how Israel has attempted to rebrand itself as a haven for queer and trans people in order to distract from its notorious reputation of human rights abuses. Legal reform concerning same-sex marriage and LGBT military service is glorified in order to present Israel as a modern democratic beacon of human rights, which we all know is not true. In its blatant disregard for Palestinian life, Israel certainly makes no exceptions for queer and trans Palestinians. There is no special pink route that allows queer Palestinians to escape the long wait and daily humiliation of checkpoints. Israel’s co-opting of the struggle for queer liberation to service their settler colonial agenda is A) insulting in that it weaponizes queerness and transness in its logics of oppression B) a form of epistemic violence in its projection of a consolidated Western definition of queerness and inherent othering of Palestinians. There are ways of being queer citizens that do not involve the visibility and rights-based politics of the mainstream LGBT movements of the West. Pink washing discourse seeks to convince Westerners like you that supporting Israel is an imperative for “modern,” “progressive” women, LGBTQ folks, and their allies, and its success relies on the racism and Islamophobia alive in those circles and apparently in this very room tonight. 

Pink washing serves the homonational project of gender and sexual exceptionalism that normalizes Israeli apartheid. Liberal rights granted to some does not justify Israeli state violence which oppresses ALL Palestinians—women, men, non-binary, trans, queer and straight alike. The illegal occupation only amplifies forms of sexual and gender oppression, and we cannot continue to misrepresent the situation by talking about sexual and gender liberation in isolation from the broader political context. What is happening in occupied Palestine is neither an extension NOR A DEFENSE of liberal democracy.  If we are to be comprehensive in our activism around feminist, queer, and trans liberation, we must necessarily unite against such forms of racism and resist the colonial projects that generate them. Queer and trans Palestinians do not need or want you to play white savior and make political decisions for them OR JUDGMENTS ABOUT THEM from your ivory tower thousands of miles away. They need your solidarity, which you can easily give by supporting this resolution. Please, please, please vote yes to divest.”

From Moira Geary: 

I’m Moira Geary, and I am the senator for the social justice coalition. As the representative of a community that fights for many different but connected social justice issues, I think we have a responsibility to take into account the actions that have come before us and the history that has been made on this campus by activists also working to end human rights abuses through divestment. There have been three divestment resolutions brought before ASG in its history, all of which have passed, but I want to focus on the first, which was the resolution to divest from companies involved in South African Apartheid in 1978. Many years after the fall of Apartheid, history has changed the narrative of how the international community accepted Apartheid, and how it was really brought down. I’m sure many people in this room have the idea that divesting from human rights abuses in South Africa was undebatable and unanimously agreed upon at the time, and that touching the issue of Israel and Palestine now is completely different. But many argued against divestment from Apartheid as well, and in the end grassroots movements to divest, boycott, and sanction ultimately had a huge effect on bringing equal rights for black South Africans. I am going to read an excerpt from a 1989 article arguing that Apartheid South Africa should not be singled out:

“WHILE the violation of human rights is the norm rather than the exception in most of Africa's 42 black-ruled states, the spotlight remains on South Africa. The images of  racism, white supremacy, Nazism, etc. are a most effective part of a campaign to play on white guilt and to condition hatred for South Africa. While it is true that there are many things wrong in South Africa, the facts are sensationalized and distorted. A cheap political campaign to get black and also well-meaning (though not as well-informed) white liberal votes, is being run by using the white “racist regime” in Pretoria as a unifying issue. Contrary to popular belief, the whites did not take the country from the blacks. When the Dutch settled in the Cape in 1652, they found a barren, largely unpopulated land. Together with French and German settlers, they built a dynamic society.”

30 years from now, which side of history do we want ourselves, and Northwestern, to be standing on?

From APAC: 

"The Asian Pacific American Coalition echoes NUDivest in calling for the severance of Northwestern's financial ties with corporations that profit from the oppression of the Palestinian people. Inaction is complicity, and the continued financial involvement with such corporations would further implicate our university in systems which work to oppress people around the world and on our own campus."

From Amina Dressen: 

“With their use of the hashtag “daily dialogue” and stated commitment to “investing in dialogue,” opponents of NU Divest have attempted to claim dialogue as something that they value and NU Divest does not.  As Director of Community Engagement for Sustained Dialogue on campus, I object to this claim.   The kind of dialogue that opponents of NU Divest stand for is a false dialogue without action, a peace without justice.  Without recognition of power inequalities and a commitment to action, dialogue becomes a tool with which to maintain oppression rather than to push for justice.  When “NU Coalition for Peace” asks us to engage in dialogue, we must ask ourselves what the purpose of this dialogue is.  If the purpose of dialogue is to maintain an oppressive status quo, then it is not a dialogue that I want to be a part of.  True dialogue is a tool for greater understanding that allows us to create a more just society and end oppression.  This is the kind of dialogue that NU Divest has promoted by reaching out to people all across campus to educate us about where our money is going, and to push to end our complicity in the oppression of the Palestinian people. This is dialogue for social justice, and this is the kind of dialogue that we must support by passing this resolution. 

Thank you,
Amina Dreessen”

Associated Student Government
Meeting of the Senate
February, 25, 2014
 

The Polling painted by William Hogarth
	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	General Order: Accreditation Presentation 
	•	Jenny: Northwestern is going through institutional accreditation. I am here to tell you how you and your constituents can be involved. I want to inform you what’s going on, give you opportunities to engage, provide resources and contact information, and sending this information to your constituents. Does anyone know what institutional accreditation is? 
	•	Kevin: It is what allows Northwestern to give degrees. 
	•	Jenny: Why does it matter? 
	•	Bella: Prestige and value of degree. 
	•	Daniel: Federal financial aid. 
	•	Jenny: Institutional accreditation is done in a geographic manner. We are lumped in with about a thousand other schools in the general North/Central part of the US. We are accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. The last time we were reaffirmed was 2005 and we are doing it again this spring. In case you are wondering, we do have a lot of programmatic and specific school accreditation processes happening as well. The one I’m talking about tonight is for the entire institution. Northwestern agreed to be part of a new pilot accreditation process. We are trying to help the HLC and other schools as this process is adapted. Mostly it means we need to submit two written reports in advance of a site visit. Seven peer reviewers are going to come here and talk to people about the university and then evaluate us and make a recommendation to the HLC. The Office of the Provost is administering the process and we have a committee that Anna has been sitting on. We were required to invite you to the HLC’s survey a couple of weeks ago, so you probably got an email asking you to do this. Another way for you to participate is that you can submit written comments to the commission. They need to be substantive comments - it’s not a forum for petty complaints. There is a section on the provost’s website about how to submit hose comments. The main reason I am here is that there are a couple of ways to be involved when the committee is here on April 27th-28th. Students will be invited to an open forum session. It is a time to be honest and explain things that did not meet your expectations as well to gloat. Details will be sent out via Northwestern News and from the Provost’s office. We are also looking for students to serve as guides for the reviewers. This is an opportunity to showcase our students as you’re walking someone from one side of campus to the other. We are exploring golf cart and other options. If you are interested and plan to be on campus and available those dates, I have included contact info. 
	•	Wendy: What other things will the team be doing on campus? 
	•	Jenny: We have to submit a report about our different programs. The majority of the time will be spent speaking with faculty and staff about those programs to confirm what we wrote. 
	•	Nehaarika: Is there any restrictions for who would serve as ambassadors? 
	•	Jenny: No, just responsible and available. We ideally want a mix. I think even freshmen could do it, but campus knowledge would be helpful. 
	•	Moira: I’m assuming you’re taking the process seriously but how much would NU have to mess up to not get reaccredited? 
	•	Jenny:  At large we are not really worried about this. We have a provost who have decided to be a leader in this process, so we are taking this very seriously. It’s more that they could ask us to go a lot of follow up work, so we’re trying to put forward an honest and comprehensive argument so they don’t send us on a wild goose chase. That’s one of the main reasons we are taking it seriously. 
	•	Liz: Do we get some sort of rating? 
	•	Jenny: It’s pretty much pass fail. We get measured on 21 criteria. At the end of the day, my understanding is that we get whether we’ve met that area, we’ve met but there are some concerns, or we have not met that area. There are some comments from the reviewers, but at the end of the day it’s more of the checkmark. 
	•	Domi: Is diversity one of the criteria? 
	•	Jenny: Yes, they ask how our mission and our commitment reflects the diversity of society. It’s worded similarly to that. We’ve put together an argument that talks about our commitment to a diverse population and also the infrastructure, our different groups and offices that are trying to build a diverse community. 
	•	Domi: What does a diverse community look to Northwestern? 
	•	Jenny: To be honest it talks about how we’ve come a long way since 2004. We talk about how we compare to our peers and how we’re looking to improve, but are proud of the changes we’ve made. 
	•	General Order: AFVP Selection Committee 
	•	Andrew: We need one undergraduate member. The application is due on March 1st, so we’ll be holding interviews the following week. 
	•	Noah: This is a really good way to either have a voice in the selection process and contribute or to learn. 
	•	Andrew: You would read the applications, be part of the interviews and the deliberations. 
	•	Mackenzie: AFVP leads a committee and serve as a leading force on the board. You don’t vote, but make sure the board is moving in line with past precedents and our guidelines. Bridging the gaps between A-status groups and Account Executives. You are a resource for things like helping them meet administrators. 
	•	Noah: We are now taking nominations. 
	•	Xavier: I nominate Kevin Cochran. 
	•	Kevin: I accept. 
	•	Kevin: My name is Kevin and I’m a freshman in SESP. I haven’t gotten too involved in ASG yet, but I’m looking forward to it. 
	•	Motion to white ballot. 
	•	No objections. 
	•	Passes unanimously. 
	•	New Business: SR1415-10: Supporting Higher Education Affordability and Illinois MAP Grants
	•	Liz: Erik cannot be here tonight, so I’ve got an authorship speech he wants to read to you all. 
	•	Erik: 
	•	Lauren: Do you know why he included to remove MAP grants from for-profits? 
	•	Moira: I’m guessing it is because for-profit universities fundamentally operate differently, because they are trying to make money. If profit is their motive, the state subsidizing education at those schools would just make tuition go up there. It’s counterintuitive for the state to be subsidizing a corporate institution rather than a non-profit. 
	•	Noah: Are MAP grants given to individuals? 
	•	Liz: Yeah. 
	•	Moira: Through the university. 
	•	Kevin: If they are cut, will Northwestern increase loans or scholarships? 
	•	Liz: They actually have already been cut, this is so when we go to Springfield we can say Northwestern is not okay with it. 
	•	Alec: Has anybody talked to the financial aid office? 
	•	Liz: Erik may have. 
	•	Lauren: Do you know if they’re reducing or cutting them completely? 
	•	Liz: It’s be cut significantly and the resolution is asking it go back to the status quo.

Northwestern University
Associated Student Government
Meeting of the Senate
February, 4, 2014
 
	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	General Order: Survey Time!!!!! 
	•	General Order: NU You
	•	Angela: Northwestern was selected to by the American Heart Association to be part of this project. We are taking the emphasis off of disease and looking at health and we are looking at it across the lifespan. We are looking at population level studies and are here to talk to you about the clinical side of the project. We are mostly interested in health behaviors and we specialize in interventions using technology. The AHA has tasked us with taking on the college population. The health habits picked up during the college era tend to last a lifetime. Our study aims to recruit 500 incoming freshmen. They will be cluster selected from different dorms. Some will be targeting four behaviors on heart health and the others will be having a more holistic intervention. We have talked to provosts and deans and health services, we have a large supportive backing from the administration. We’ve worked with the Delta lab here to get student impact on what they think about health. We’ve done focus groups as well. We care most about diet, physical health, smoking and weight. We’ve learned that you guys really value success academically and we know there is lack of access to healthy food and there are barriers to getting physical activity. You’re overscheduled. Our current features of our applications will have scheduling and things to help prioritize. Also it would have incentives. I say this generally, because nothing has been designed or evaluated. We are interested in doing hackathon like things in design, programming and the evaluation part. We want it to be student driven and functional. That is our overview. I have a couple questions for you guys. Anyone you think we should be talking to? Anything you see missing? Are there significant needs that we’re not aware of? 
	•	Grace: Maybe talking to Sodexo who supplies the food at school. 
	•	Angela: We’ve been in a lot of talks with NU Dining. It’s not totally solidified what some of those features will look like, but there are talks in the back. 
	•	Jonathan: Have you explored exercise facilities? Especially on south campus? 
	•	Angela: While there’s not much we can do about creating a gym, there are some strategies we’re looking at for the dorms selected in the cluster. We are working with residence halls on the space that they have. 
	•	Grace: I know Ayers-CCI has a big room not being used. 
	•	Kaley: Check with the Residential Colleges. PARC has the same thing. 
	•	Daniel: I think it would be interesting to consider the health in different parts of campus. 
	•	Angela: We’ve been brainstorming on how we can expand it after we do the randomization of the freshmen on campus. 
	•	Olivia: Are you taking into account student athletes? 
	•	Angela: Certainly we would want to make sure our whole sample isn’t athletes. We do cluster randomization to make sure we’re getting a diverse group of students. 
	•	Daniel: northwestern gyms offer different classes and there is lack of information about those. 
	•	Lauren: If we could have an app with accurate nutrition information for the food we are given. 
	•	Bella: We would also appreciate that for ready made food. 
	•	Noah: How will you go about being sensitive for students with eating disorders? 
	•	Angela: We do dietary interventions a lot with things like binge eating disorders. We have the ability to track data and flag people and reach out. We wouldn’t recommend it to everyone, but we have data that these interventions do not exacerbate eating disorders. We also have ways for people to turn off features if you are only focused on one thing. 
	•	Robert: Look into the differences between on campus and off campus eating. 
	•	Grace: How do you plan to get 25% of the incoming students doing this? 
	•	Angela: We have access to the admitted students list, so we are reaching out early. We also have incentives. We are also reaching out to PAs to teach them about this. The Pre-Orientation leaders would also be involved in that. We will also be doing booths and recruitment events. Our target is to have them entered into the intervention by the eighth week of school. 
	•	Angela: The monetary rewards are small and not coercive. It would not be equitable to a job or anything. We do have lotteries built in, but again the chances of winning are low enough that they aren’t coercive. 
	•	Brooke: The classes and things that are offered at SPAC are very popular. People would like to have them at a space like Blom. 
	•	General Order: NUDivest 
	•	Noah: We wanted today to be an informational session. We are not presenting legislation. Presentation! At NU Divest we are focusing on two things. We are calling for more transparency, not just for this issue, but for any issues in the future. There have also been some in the past. NU Divest is calling for divestment from Boeing, Caterpillar, Elibt Systems, Hewlett-Packard, G4S and Lockheed Martin. Now I will open the floor to questions. 
	•	-: Why israel specifically when there are other places with human rights violations like Qatar where we have a campus?
	•	Heather: It’s not necessarily calling out Israel, but holding it to a standard of all other places. 
	•	Cynthia: We’re looking at multi-national companies that are complicit in issues in Israel, but also complicit in human rights violations all around the world. G4S in the US is complicit in locking up tons of black and brown bodies. We really want to make sure that it is known that these companies are complicit in human rights violations all around the world. 
	•	Heather: We can’t pick everything and are doing this in particular. In this instance there was a call from the Palestinian people. It is one instance where we can answer a call. 
	•	Cynthia: We come to this from different points. I joined the campaign because I am Chicana. 
	•	Matt: You talk about the fact that these companies have violations all around the world, but the NU Divest resolution mentions specifically companies in Palestine. You say you want to hold Israel to the same standard as everyone else, then why is it only say things about Palestine? 
	•	Noah: There has been a call from Palestinian civil society specifically, not in Qatar, etc. so we are choosing to propose the divestment part of that solidariy. 
	•	Lauren: When are you bringing this before Senate? 
	•	Noah: Someime this quarter. 
	•	John: Would this decrease our ROY and increase our tuition? 
	•	Noah: That’s incredibly unlikely. There are socially responsible investments that would receive equal if not better returns. 
	•	John: Are you aware Boeing is on the NU Board of Trustees? 
	•	Noah: Yes. 
	•	Jake: You associate with BDS who are in support of a one state solution. Will NU Divest take a stand on that? 
	•	Heather: Our stand is that you need human rights before talking about solutions. As Divestment no we are not seeking a specific plan, we don’t want to impose that on them. 
	•	Jake: But by associating yourself with BDS, isn’t it implied? 
	•	Noah: We don’t promote any particular solution to the conflict other than saying we support human rights. 
	•	Cynthia: And we aren’t lawmakers. 
	•	Faheem: Have you reached out and seen the feasibility of divestment? Do you have a timeline? 
	•	Noah: Discussions about divestment in general have not been received well with the administration. We don’t know about timelines until 
	•	Jonathan: Downstairs there is a mural with the state of Israel and NU Divest, which implies divesting from Israel. You say that you aren’t trying to target Israel, then why do you have two messages? 
	•	Heather: I don’t think there are two messages. Pointing our human rights in Israel is not a problem. 
	•	Noah: These human rights issues are happening in Israel and we can’t separate them from the places they occur. 
	•	Kevin: Is this something other schools have done? 
	•	Noah: 6 out of the 8 California schools have. The conversation is happening many places. 
	•	Alex: Do we know for sure that we are invested in these companies? 
	•	Noah: We don’t because of how untransparent Northwestern is, but it is likely that they are. 
	•	General Order: Student Group Senate Seat Apportionment 
	•	Noah: If you are in a student group that may want representation in Senate, make sure to let them know how to apply. 
	•	New Business: Supporting the Real Food Challenge Campus Commitment and Real Food Calculator
	•	Miranda: We are trying to asking Northwestern to commit to pledging 20% for Real Food by 2020. If all universities did this, it would represent a 1 billion dollar shift. 
	•	Alexi: It is in NU’s best interest to do this, because we would be the second of the to 20 universities and the first in the Big Ten to sign on. This would be an opportunity for Northwestern to lead, because so far it has been mostly small liberal arts schools. 
	•	Bella: What has your interaction with Sodexo been? I mean NU Dining…
	•	Miranda: We’ve been meeting with them since August with various degrees of success. We just heard back that they are going to do the calculator to see what NU is at. So we are finally on the same page. 
	•	Nicholas: How correlated is Real Food with healthy eating? 
	•	Miranda: Nutrition is just one of the things we’re dealing with. Mostly we are considered with worker’s rights and environmental issues . Health means a lot of things to a lot of different people, so that’s not the focus of the campaign. 
	•	Daniel: Can you talk about the relationship between GMOs and worker’s rights? 
	•	Miranda: Yeah, it’s not necessarily about health, but about the companies who contribute to cycles of poverty in foreign countries.
	•	Bella: After 20% by 2020, is there a next step? 
	•	Alexi: The amount we pledge is the baseline amount. For example, Bard College has committed to 40%. It really depends on what NU feels like they can commit. Johns Hopkins committed to 35%. 
	•	Lauren: Would this cause food costs to go up? 
	•	Miranda: The short answer is no. What happens with this commitment, a food group is created to figure out how to source Real Food through our budget. At this point NU is probably in the teens, so this isn’t a huge change. 
	•	Olivia: Why are we only doing 20%?
	•	Miranda: We are going with the minimal ask. If Northwestern wants to go higher then we would love to. It’s harder in Chicago because of the weather, but if schools in Minnesota can do it, then I think we can. 
	•	Alexi: More rural schools do have greater access to smaller farmers and Real Food. It is harder for us. 
	•	Miranda: That being said, George Washington has done it, Johns Hopkins has done it. 
	•	Nicholas: With the cost, what’s going to give? How would buying more expensive food not increase costs? 
	•	Miranda: There is an answer to this that I can’t talk about it. There will be room in the Sodexo budget that will be opening soon. There will be changes in the menu, which will probably be a good thing. This would just be a difference in the dining halls, which reduces cost, because produce is produce. 
	•	Nicholas: You clearly have the issue with the rights of workers but organic food will need more labor? 
	•	Miranda: It does require more labor, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. On an organic farm there are more opportunities for working when you’re developing real skills and getting a fairer wage. 
	•	Old  Business: Wild Ideas Funding Slate 
	•	Nicholas: McSA is having a nation of Islam event. They will be bringing in speakers and are collaborating with all different communities. The Hunt is an experimental scavenger hunt in which the goal is to experience something and reduce stress. WAVE Productions has a new production called the anti-play, which is a weird kind of play that is immersive and has no dialogue. The last event is MEChA and they are having a speaker as well. The organization has been great and we think they’ll do a great job. If anybody has a problem with one particular funding item, you can do that. 
	•	Jonathan: Are you aware that this speaker said “the day of judgment will never happen until you fight the jews…” Are you aware that we have an anti-Semitic speaker on the slate? 
	•	Andrew: We were not aware of that. 
	•	Serene: That’s because he is not anti-Semitic, he was quoting other people. 
	•	Grace: How much money is left? 
	•	Nicholas: We have in excess of $20,000 left. 
	•	Ross: Motion to divide the question. Separate the MEChA funding from everything else. I think there are people who disagree with the speaker and the others aren’t controversial. 
	•	Ruba: As someone who has heard him speak before, he is not anti-Semitic. He has been hosted before with ASG money. 
	•	Daniel: Can the people who are claiming he has made remarks present evidence? 
	•	Jonathan: It is called cameraoncampus.org. 
	•	Lauren: Regardless of how you feel about the speaker, clearly it is controversial and the other don’t seem like they will be. We should give everyone the chance to speak on them separately. 
	•	Moira: The camera on campus website says in their tagline that they are pro-Israel. My main point is that we shouldn’t divide a question because to entertain this. The point of the Wild Ideas Committee is not to fund just things that you agree with. There have been lots of speakers that have been brought to campus who are racist. I’m not saying we should have racist speakers, but I don’t think that matters for funding. 
	•	PQ
	•	Second
	•	Noah: We are voting on whether to divide the question. 
	•	Passes 15 - 12 - 2. 
	•	Noah: We are now in discussion on the first three parts of the slate. 
	•	PQ
	•	Second
	•	No Objections
	•	Passes unanimously. 
	•	Noah: We are now in discussion of the final request. 
	•	Jonathan: I only brought this up because I read his quote on a website. If other people are saying that he’s not then I can understand that. I just wanted to bring that up. 
	•	Ariel: Rub can you talk about him more? 
	•	Ruba: He is a widely respected speaker. He is a scholar in ethnic studies and Muslim Studies. I wouldn’t attend his talks if he’s anti-Semitic. The website doesn’t look legitimate to me. if he is anti-Semitic then someone should tell UC Berkeley. 
	•	Isaac: There is no evidence to say that he is anti-Semitic. They all link to each other and quote one person you can’t find information about online. I don’t think we should be funding hate speakers, but we can’t say that about this person. MEChA does good things and I think we should fund them. 
	•	PQ
	•	Second
	•	No Objections
	•	Passes
	•	Old Business: SL1415-10: Undergraduate Discrimination and Harassment Act 2015
	•	Petros: I can understand the skepticism of symbolism, but symbolism is important and has effects. I will be motioning for an amendment that is more concise. 
	•	Petros: Motion to amend. I wanted to change it so that it is more concise and accessible. 
	•	Lauren: Why did you take out the part of ASG not taking action against this? 
	•	Isaac: The point of a constitution is to be active. If we just want to change our intent, we could pass a resolution. It doesn’t demand action, but it also doesn’t preclude it. 
	•	Jake: Would you consider making this not Article I? 
	•	Petros: I just wanted it there because people looking at it wouldn’t need to scroll. 
	•	PQ
	•	Second
	•	No objectons
	•	Amendment passed
	•	Jake: Motion to make this Article V rather than Article I. 
	•	Petros: I wanted it to be number one so that it is right there. I think sometimes people are lazy and maybe they won’t find it. 
	•	Bella: I think logically what is currently at the end should be at the end. I think this merits being at the top. The order between one and four is a small thing, but I don’t think this is necessary. 
	•	Johnny: In terms of the appropriateness of it at the end. The US Constitution, Article VI deals with amendments and then the Bill of Rights follows, which is similar. 
	•	Grace: Motion to amend. Move it to number II. 
	•	Jake: I withdraw mine. 
	•	Moira: I think if someone is going to the constitution and they want to see what ASG does and they see a disclaimer, they will skip over and see what we do. If people don’t want to read it, they’ll skip through it. Disclaimers normally go at the top. 
	•	PQ
	•	Second
	•	Johnny: Objection because I have something to say. 
	•	Withdrawn
	•	Johnny: Moving it to number two will change the flow of the Constitution. Only makes sense at beginning or the end. 
	•	Amendment fails. 
	•	Noah: Now in discussion of original legislation. 
	•	Passes. 
	•	Old  Business: SR1415-07 Active Consent on College Campuses 
	•	Passes unanimously
	•	Roll Call and Adjournment
ASG Senate
March 28, 2012

	•	Roll Call
	•	Confirmation of PRVP
	•	Becca: have experience on DM public relations, ASG public relations
	•	Ian: How will you engage social media?
	•	Becca: Twitter, use updated ASG website
	•	Terrance: current ASG image
	•	Becca: don’t think it’s negative, just think people don’t care enough
	•	Mark: In one sentence or less, describe how you want campus to see ASG?
	•	Becca: Every student to actually engage in ASG, look at FB page, look at tweets, make an effort of being a part of campuswide
	•	Matt: Do you plan on applying to be PR for year ahead?  If yes, what kind of grassroots plans do you have?
	•	Becca: If all goes well, I do plan on applying again.  Looking into next year, I want to fully try to engage committee more and branch out in different methods to reach entire campus.  ASG Newsletter that people can read.  Commit myself to getting these things done and pick people who really want to spend time working on projects and commit to changing image of ASG.
	•	Parliamentary Body Elections
	•	Wilson: For the speaker; can nominate yourself
	•	Neil: Nominate Aaron
	•	Aaron: I accept
	•	Paul: I nominate Ani
	•	Ani: I gratefully accept
	•	Mark: Please describe the duties of Speaker
	•	Wilson: (lists some tasks)
	•	Wilson: Nominations are closed; 5 minute introduction speech.  Question period no more than 10 minutes.
	•	Ani: All I learned to do in Medill was tell stories.  Today, I will tell you my story, because it has a lot to do with why I’m here.  Coming to Northwestern was about finding a family I could be part of rest of my life.  Figured I needed to experience as much as I could do.  Asked myself if this was the best way to go.  Over the past two years, come to see ASG and Senate as very real channel with which to connect to community.  It has the potential to be central hub of community that is decentralized.  As member of Katie’s student life committee, my first project was mailrooms.  I’ve been behind the scenes of housing ordinance—been on front lines with talking with admin about resources.  Let me translate in terms of speaker.
	•	Aaron: Hi everyone!  Freshman year, I was a student groups senator representing Hillel.  Did rally towels for tailgate—most successful ever had.  Served on senate reform committee.  Throughout this entire process, wanted to make sure Senate was about efficiency and getting things done.  this year, I became IFC senator.  I can bring balance between efficiency and fun.  It’s more important to make sure other senators have their voices heard.  I have matured greatly and am really proud about job I’ve done in Greek Caucus.
	•	Wilson: Questions
	•	Amalia: Who do you think the Speaker answers to?
	•	Ani: Senate
	•	Aaron: Obviously Queen Amalia.  No, as I said before, Speaker not only answers to Senate, but to students at large.
	•	Victor: Role of speaker in recruitment
	•	Aaron: feel it’s very important to be complete exec effort in summer and in the fall a complete Senate attempt.
	•	Ani: Feel speaker needs to be well-connected to community because recruitment needs connections: 1) plugged in 2) recruitment doesn’t end once they’re accepted; it is about training.
	•	Matt: What do you think the single biggest problem with Senate is?
	•	Ani: purpose, mission, sense of camaraderie; any student group, we are a student group to a large extent, to feel together.
	•	Aaron: Neil example
	•	Ian: Motion to extend by one question; How would you deal with exec members acting out in Senate?
	•	Aaron: exec board reports?  Senate is senate—exec more on long-term goals. Senate on short-term.
	•	Ani: I disagree—senate is not short-term body.  Exec should be held to same standard as Senators.
	•	[Candidates leave for discussion period.  Comments below are without names but made by people present]
	•	Emphatically for Ani—he possesses proper talent, disposition for this role.  Commands respect.  Involvement is extensive and deep.  More than anyone, he has things to speak for because he knows what to expect.  Exactly the kind of person we need in this position.
	•	I’ve seen four speakers at Northwestern now and I could say that if Ani is not elected tonight it would be a travesty.  ASG would be at a loss with him without Speaker.  I want you to think about the future of ASG.  Consider the freshmen who are coming in next year and you are coming to an ASG orientation session or Senate and this is your first exposure to ASG, who do you want up there representing ASG.  Ani has the right temperament, patience; he is a doer.  When Senators come to him with questions, he knows where to point them.
	•	One of the first things I did was join the Election Commission and it was because Ani really encouraged me and I think that is important in senator training.
	•	Wilson: The Winner for Speaker is Ani Ajith.
	•	[Ani is sworn in.]
	•	Wilson: Senate is never going to be a useful and effective body unless you are right there pushing each other.  The ball is in your court.  It’s been fun.  So long and thanks for all the fish!
	•	Ani: Nominations for Parliamentarian are now open.
	•	Motoki: I nominate Brandon.
	•	Brandon: I accept.
	•	Ani: You have five minutes to give your speech.
	•	Brandon: I joined Senate when I was a sophomore.  I found rules committee to be one of the best commitments I’ve taken as a Senator.  It teaches you about how Senate works and gives you a chance to work with Senators from all four caucuses.  It is a way to work with Senators to know what they’re doing as far as the Parliamentary process goes.  I want better utilization of the Rules Committee.  We can use out time better—different Senators come in and learn how to write legislation.  I would love to be Parliamentarian for the upcoming year.  I have served on numerous election commissions.
	•	Ani: ten minutes for questions.
	•	David: One of the most important roles is to act as organization’s disciplinarian.  Are you comfortable with that?  How aggressive would you be?
	•	Brandon: It is difficult talking to Senators and sort things out.  We like to sort things out before it comes to that.  If it does come to that, I feel comfortable leading the committee.
	•	Ian: Time commitment.  Can move schedule around to account for exec, rules, etc.
	•	Ani: Question period is closed.
	•	Matt: Motion to suspend the rules and white ballot.
	•	Ani: All in favor of white ballot.  Motion passes.  Congratulations sir, you have been white balloted.
	•	David Chi: [Campaign Speech]
	•	Paul: Motion to white ballot.  The Ays have it.
	•	Ani: Congratulations, you have been elected Treasurer.
	•	[Josephine Lee Swears David Chi as ASG Treasurer]
	•	Ani: Elections for Clerk.
	•	[5k Committee Update]
	•	Transportation Working Group Update
	•	Ani: And now we have a general order about the working group for transportation
	•	Katie: We were using 
	•	Victor: So we have compiled a working list of contacts. We are also using data from an IE presentation because we can’t do it alone! We are proposing that e lobby  for increased funding for saferide, and database integration. 
	•	Katie: The shuttles also want us to look for quality assurance riders, and address the feasibility of adding stops and 
	•	Victor:
	•	Ian: To what extent are you guys considering sustainability?
	•	Victor: Safety comes first, but the saferides are priuses (priuii?)
	•	Mark: Could I join..as an interested senator concerned with sustainability?
	•	Victor: Sure
	•	Ani: Great! Great 
(Roll Call)
Ani: quarum, motions on the floor, moving to new business. 
Victor: senator training, conducted senator sureys, rules committee is an integral part of senate that has a big role. It follows that, it would make sense or rules committee to hold traiing sessions for new senators. Rules committee has the time for it and Brandon is on board, that’s the first one. 
Ani: Any questions?
Victor: It would take one session to go over the basics, ideally we would want a senator to submit the legislation before the first meeting. I don’t for see it being more than that. 
Mark: What are your ideas for the punishment for missing the training
V: up to the committee
PHA: when would this start?
V: up to the committee
Ani: moving onto the SL73 Senator Handbook
V: a vary broad knowledge of ASG, not centralized resource that teaches senators to do their job, this has 7 different sections
M: this is something that the dorm senators have been talking about for a quarter, senators have no idea what their doing or what has been done. imagine this to be a binder passed down that will have everything you need to know as a senator. Bullet points identified by RHA RCB caucus. 
V: how this handbook would be written: we think the caucus whips should be a part as well as VP parliamentarian and speaker of the senate because they do the internal operations of senate and they oversee it. 
RHA: any plans in place to institutionalize this hand book?
V: we can add that this is updated by rules (annually)
Matt: do have copies of the former handbook?
Victor: Yes
Ian: you have a member of exec and whips in charge, what kind of discipline do you have in place if they fail to produce a draft
V:that would be on the team to come together, the extent of the measures we do have are that it has to be approved by senate. The second draft will also need approval.
V: preferably we will move it up so we can start get it moving
Ian: are those people on board that would be required to be involved
V: I havnt asked them. We can keep this old business. 
Dan: we had an online constitutioal forum, the last senate there was an amendment to strike, what came up out of the forum, allow the election commission to set a date at their own discretion. I would be open to any friendly amendments. Equal opportunity to campaign during the campaign period. Allow students to observe the campaign period. 
Aaron: but back the clause about the 3rd week of the quarter with the committee to reserve the right to change the date, any questions
Mark: put the election in a situation where they can be influenced by candidates, assuming direct contact btwn commission and candidates
Dan: there is already this interactions, we can trust the public servants to act responcibly becauses that is what they have been selected to do.
Aaron: we elect these senators, if you are not in agreement don’t pass it. 
Mark: in that case I propose the amendment have a deadline
Matt: ASG suffers from lack of constitutional memory, since precedent is to have it on the third week is there something we can do to ensure that the 3rd week is strongly recommended. 
Dan: you are welcome to make a friendly amendment to insure that
Aaron: this is the amendment
Austin: it says the Pres and VP… the academic VP and student life VP, but theoretically the election commission could choose not to set a date
Dan: could set in stipulation that an election must occur. 
Aaron: not changing any assumptions 
Steven: potentially clarifying question, do you think its necessary to set a date as a minimum, what Austin was alluding to, an extreme situation, do you think it is necessary to ensure there is a final date set. 
Aaron: there is no point in doing something you dont know until it is finalized. I think that is in the code, I don’t think its fare to put in a specific date. We just want a clause that can allow a change to happen. 
Dan: I personally think we need a date? No, because I trust the discretion. If you think it is necessary I anticipate this round of amendments. 
Brad: what this amendment is proposing, it does not specify the date that THIS election will be occurring, because the date is passed for this year, would this election be subject to this. 
Dan: I believe the committee can supersede this
Groups: it has the dates set, 
Ani: there are actual dates that need to be changed
Dan: now the constitution would change this
Groups: if we change it, the change has to be approved by senate so there is still a check on the committee that is senate. we don’t have to change it but if they did it would have to be approved by senate
Ani: the election commission guidelines would have to be brought back up and approved by senate, is this a fair interpretation. 
Brad: because they have to ability to set the date, in order to bring that amendment up we would have to bring that up tonight, to what point would the election committee feel comfortable doing this
Ash: realistically how long does the election committee need to do this
Election commissioner: I want this to be done by senate, not to be left by the committee. as they are written now, petitions are due on Friday. must be due tonight 
Motoki: is this amendment solely for this cycle or for the future
Dan: for the future as well
Steven: as the amendment is read now, is there anything that prevents the commission from being amended multiple times? is there any protection against that, if not is that an issue?
Dan: there is a protection, 
Tori: for what reasons do you deem it acceptable to change the date
Dan: equal opportunity to all candidates, precedent by NU, delayed Welcome Week to accommodate Yom Kippur. Accommodating all religious beliefs. 
(extend question period)
Tori: hypothetically assume holiday overlaps with every holiday, how do you determine which holiday is most important?
Dan: there is a limited number of candidates, were asking for the ability to observe the holidays they feel obliged to observe. There is a limited amount of holidays that can be observed by candidates. 
Daniel: this has never come up in the past. Why does your choice, have to affect the constitution of ASG
Dan: all students should be able to run for ASG because of a neutral scheduling block. I don’t think it should be a burden placed on me to give up on campaigning so I can practice Easter
Daniel: others have to make choices all the time. 
Aaron: this is a different, matter, he cannot change it. 
Ani: lets not make this a back and forth
Ani: in response to the amendment, if they pass senate has the power to reconsider the power an senator could motion to reconsider. at that point you can make amendments. great
Ani: debate period, pro speeches
Tori: hi guys, I see many things wrong with this amendment, this hasn’t been an issue in the past, should have been brought up last quarter. What religion is more important? Shabbat is every Friday. If they are elected, they will have to make this choice all the time. Having the time that the election is now, it is before midterm season, it is optimal for the student body. This will only benefit the candidates and not the student body, we already have a hard time, the turnout is already not very great
Ani: pro speech
Motoki: in this debate we should not be focused on whether or not this thing will change the election cycle. We should focus on in the future if this comes up do we want senate to debate this again. I wont comment on this cycle, in the future, should we have the power to change this
Dan: It would take place in the 4th week, not the 5th or 6th, if you say academics are more important than allowing students to observe religious beliefs, I find that concerning, It was brought up in the past. This is your time you decide what you want to do. 
Ani: the senate shall approve the day of the election. Senate, already has this power if you want to consititutionalize this you can.
Matt: we aren’t debating the amendment itself
Ani: we are debating whether this amendment should be made. We are in the last pro con round. is there a con speech. 
Satirios: people are having trouble with whether or not it is set in stone, completely unnecessary, if you cant handle this, if youre not youre not doing your job. Were figuring out a way to figure out the hypothetical. 
Ani: in motion to vote:
(Passed)
this is now the proposed amendment to debate
Mark: I want one week to allow the committee to speak with the candidates. 
Groups: the way it is now, the date will have to be set by the time the elections  guidelines are passed. 
Ani: largely up to the discretion of the election committee. 
Ani: the date of the election has to be in the guidelines. 
Aaron: amend the line to say “by the end of winter quarter” the day of the election
Ani: now in line to debate the election. 
Ian: motion to amend the amendment: …
Ani: is there any debate for this? pros or con? PQ?
Fransis: we wont be able to change the date if this passes?
Steven: we would theoretically have to approve it, yes.
Ani: there is a decision, parliamentary interpritation, if this amendment passes, the amendment to approve the day of the elections. then senate would be bound to not be able to change the day. 
Ian
Ani: this doesn’t leave any room for senate to revise the guidelines. We are in line for a pro speech. in line for a vote, to delete the “day of the election and”
(passes)
now we are in line for debate. debating the last sentence
Mark: motivation is straightforward, addresses flexibility to discuss w potential candidates. unfortunate the new amendment wouldn’t apply to this election cycle, this is appropriate, a fair compromise, Ian agrees
Aaron: after speaking to francis, the way the language is written, senate is at a bind forcing senate to approve something by the end of winter quarter, I would like to amend it to say, “presented to senate by the end of winter quarter”
Ian: doesn’t senate defacto pass the guidelines by the end of winter quarter
Austin: they bring forth the guidelines by winter quarter
Ian: pro, given that senate generally passes these guidelines by the end of quarter, we are putting into words what we already do, this also solves many of the problems Dan presented, we don’t have to deal with technicalities. in coming years we will have to deal with the election in the future, not necessarily for religious reasons. Lets move away from this being a religious reason. 
Matt: con, everybody knows were talking around the real issue. Dan brought it up 4 weeks ago, we drowned him in all this crap about changing the constitution. what is at issue here to be discussed. Lets talk about we can change the election this year by one week. This has been a rant
Mark: just to address your point Matt, I think you’re right, this is an issue that we should address. I wish the election wasn’t in two weeks, we cant be inconsistent , we have to oblige ourselves to the rules we have agreed to. we have to address the pertinent issue that there are only 2 weeks. 
Ani: con?
Dan: I want to provide for the future under the understanding that we don’t harm the present, abide by your laws but that doesn’t mean you cant change them. I don’t think you are bound, I hope the student government is not bound by its laws. I cant say any more that hasn’t been said. 
Ani: what we are debating is the last sentence. we are now in line for a PQ on this amendment. all in favor of the last line
(passed)
Ani: in round for 3 rounds of pro con on this text as it stands: 
Aaron: change approved to presented
(division)
(did not pass)
Ani: in line for pro con, there is a motion to change wording to make sense. 
Mark: this leaves a lot of room for ambiguity, blatant inconsistency, some extraneous information, its what our intent is, it just has to be codified
Ani: motion to PQ, motion to extend senate 15 minutes.  we will now vote on whether to vote on extending. 
(passed)
we are now ending at 10 45
roll call
quarum is filled
Ani: in line to debate this amendment, all in favor to approve, 
(passed)
Ani: pro con
Motoki: motion to bring back the original
Ani: no second there is no motion, pro for this?
Ian: I think what started out as a second argument, this is different from what we started as, which is good. 
Austin: con, okay, at this point this debate has become too focused on religion on whether honoring Aaster is a good enough excuse, if you take that out of the factor, you will see some other issues with giving the committee the authority to move the election, 1 looking at the timeline of how this effects the rest of the elections, week three they would transitions. so even at the fastest you could get this out, would be week 9 or ten, losing the rest of spring quarter, exec believes this is a detriment. Midterms have been brought up. we are at an academic institution, last year we were elected a week before I had 3 midterms. there are certain dates that have president, that other groups work around. 
Francis: were this to pass we cant change the date of this election, 
Ani: this would have to happen within the last week of winter quarter, 
Francis: could be proposed earlier if the speaker put it on the agenda. 
There is no objection to PQ
roll call vote
(14 yes, 9 no)
does not pass)

Northwestern University
Associated Student Government
Meeting of the Senate
March, 4, 2014

Among the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California painted by Albert Bierstadt

	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	General Order: PVMNT 
	•	Presented their mobile app as an alternative to flyering. They also presented their user statistics, which is about 1000 unique web users and they have not had a hard launch yet. They also explained what their next steps are, which include: creating user and cub profiles, confining it to Northwestern users, add self-moderation, etc. Additionally, the android app is under development. They want to be Northwestern’s go to place for event discovery when students are trying to get involved. They also encouraged Senate to give them any feedback they have. 
	•	General Order: Funding Overview 
	•	 Andrew: We are just trying to get some feedback right now from you. 
	•	Isaac: I think that funding has a tendency to give more money to people who have historically gotten more money, which creates cycles. 
	•	Wendy: There is a negative vibe about favorites and groups that get more. I think that’s an issue about transparency. 
	•	Moira: Compared to other schools that don’t have a delineation between A-status and B-status, recognized student groups were generally able to get more programming. Whereas B-status groups here do not have access to much money. 
	•	Tom: I’ve always wondered what kind of metrics are used. Do you use quantitative measures? 
	•	Mackenzie: There are a lot of metrics that go along with it, but it’s not just quantitative using attendance. 
	•	Jonathan: Some events are not intended for all of campus and the way funding is focused now is for events that benefit the whole campu. 
	•	Mackenzie: The reasoning in the past has been we don’t want to spend student money on something they are not allowed to attend. 
	•	Ruba: We need to have a bigger B-status pool. Also the rule for not funding food, we hear a lot of complaints about that. Some groups food really is essential. 
	•	Moira: The type of events that get funded I think are geared to big name speakers and panels that people fly in for. That’s the majority of the events and I would like to see things moving in the direction of being more specific to Northwestern. 
	•	Isaac: Over-programming. 
	•	Ruba: Having to plan super far in advance limits creativity. 
	•	Tom: I think ASG could link up with other methods of funding. 
	•	Moira: Why do we fund things the administration is already willing to fund? It limits money to groups that aren’t connected to the administration. 

Emergency Legislation: 
	•	Will: We are upset about not getting our seats. 
	•	Isaac: This is a resolution not legislation, right? 
	•	Will: Yes. 
	•	Isaac: If it’s a resolution that makes a statement, why does it matter when it is made? 
	•	Will: We want to talk about it while it is a hot topic and then we want to see what Senators think before starting the new term. 
	•	Lauren: If it is put on the agenda tonight we vote on it next week? 
	•	Noah: Yes. 
	•	Moira: What is preventing dialogue or voicing concerns before you are able to introduce a formal piece of legislation. 
	•	Will: We want to do it tonight so we can make a decision next week without having to hurriedly push it through. 
	•	Andrew: Just to quickly outline in the code how we evaluate groups. With regards to this decision the committee had a tough year and did not feel like including these groups would allow Northwestern to be more representative than the ones we chose. We spent over ten hours on the process so it was definitely thoughtful. 
	•	Isaac: What are the potential actionables that this would produce. 
	•	Will: If we knew exactly the action we were going to take, then it wouldn’t be a resolution. 
	•	Isaac: Is it not true that most potential actionables would need to go through Senate anyways? 
	•	Will: Yes and we are trying to see if we have support before then. 
	•	Olivia: Some of the senators who received their seats are not able to talk about this yet. 
	•	Will: We are not saying that we deserve it more than other people. 
	•	Moira: So I think that it is extremely important to remember this is a resolution and any actionable items would not be able to happen until next term when the seats who want to push this through don’t have seats anymore. Even presenting this now won’t give them the leverage that they want. It would be different if this was emergency legislation to add more seats that would make sense, but there is no reason to pass a resolution of support right now. Since those seats are already not going to exist after next week, the only point of pushing this through immediately would be in the name of future legislation. 
	•	Alec: I think it is pertinent now because if they came to us in two weeks I would wonder why they didn’t bring it up when it happened. 
	•	Isaac: I don’t think that this is an emergency. Your justification for wanting to get the Senate’s opinions before you want to introduce something with teeth is unnecessary. That’s not even to talk about the content, that’s just the principle. I think Olivia’s question is pertinent, because a lot of the stakeholders are not in the room. Saying you were unfairly wronged is saying that the people who are not here are not deserving. 
	•	Nick: I think the argument is a bit hypocritical. Because certain seats are not here, they deserve to have a vote. You’re saying that once they lose their seats they don’t get that respect. The fairest thing to do is to  allow people to speak from both sides. 
	•	PQ
	•	Passes. It is now on the agenda as new business. 22-10-5
	•	New Business: B-Status Funding
	•	Funding presentation. 
	•	Parag: What is the amendment pool? 
	•	Kenny: About 800. Doesn’t mean you have to use it all. 
	•	Tom: Was any group denied funds completely? 
	•	Kenny: Only one who turned it in late. 
	•	New Business: Emergency Legislation for College Democrats/Republicans 
	•	Domonic: Quentin, President of College Democracts could not be here tonight. We found out later after 20 years of having a seat that our seat was taken away. There is a complete lack of a political voice on this campus. When you have groups like the College Democrats and College Republicans you lose students who are politcally minded. By cutting our political groups you are saying those who might see themselves as a republican or democrat as being ignored. The SGAC says that voice does not matter and we will silence that voice. Our resolution calls for Senate to say the political cross section of this student body does deserve to be heard. 
	•	Noah: Aren’t the constituencies you represent large enough that they could be represented by students in the residential caucus? 
	•	Domonic: Everyone is already represented once. 
	•	Jo Ann: Is the resolution only about College Democrats and Republicans?
	•	Domonic: It is not specific to us, but it was written by their presidents. 
	•	Isaac: Do you think the other groups do not have political voices? 
	•	Domonic: It is not their priority. Ours actually are political voices.
	•	Noah: Why is it important to have specific seats rather than just having people who identify as democrats or republicans? 
	•	Domonic: We are the only groups who will always have a political opinion. This isn’t a question of politics it is a question of representations. Should people with political interests have a voice? 
	•	Kevin: The college democrats have over 800 people on our listserv and so it is clear there are students who are politically active. 
	•	Isaac: Do you think political parties are relevant to the student senate? 
	•	Domonic: No I do not, but sometimes senate does comment on things like that. 
	•	Olivia: Do you think in most legislation we argue along party lines? I guess I’m asking the senators. 
	•	Will: I can get 100 responses if I send a vote over our listserv, because political students are very politically active. 
	•	Kevin: Why wouldn’t you apply as a joint group like any other coalitions? Why would you not just have one political seat? 
	•	That is something we would consider. 
	•	Moira: Do you feel there was some kind of misconduct on the part on the apportionment committee? 
	•	Domonic: I wouldn’t say there was purposeful wrongdoing, but maybe an oversight. 
	•	Kevin: The previous dems senator did not do a good job so that might have been part of the decision. I wouldn’t like to see one bad apple spoil the whole bunch. I think Will and I can both contribute well to this body and so can our groups. 
	•	Isaac: Motion to commit this to the SGAC. We have a committee for this for a reason. I think that it’s a no-brainer in saying you put it to the committee who is in charge of this. 
	•	Ariel: They just decided so would this be like an appeal process. Doesn’t make much sense to me if there is not an appeal process. 
	•	Isaac: Were there attendance issues? 
	•	Dana: Yes. 
	•	Effectively this would mean a conversation with the SGAC and the groups involved. 
	•	Isaac: Committees are allowed to write legislation to change things. 
	•	If this motion is passed the resolution would not be voted on. 
	•	Nicholas: Is there any reason to suggest the decision would change because of the resolution? 
	•	Andrew: It’s a six person committee and I don’t think that it’s appropriate for us to say. 
	•	Ruba: If we pass this resolution and then legislation, won’t it just go back to the SGAC? 
	•	Noah: We would open up applications again if more seats were added. 
	•	Ruba: Ultimately, the SGAC would have a lot of say in this process anyways. So a conversation with this committee would probably be recommended? 
	•	Noah: The SGAC would have to take action unless there is a constitutional and code amendment. 
	•	Moira: I feel like there are a lot of important things that should be said here and we are jumping to conclusions. Right now there is a resolution brought up to the Senators that the College Dems and Repubs should have a seat and that they don’t have one, but they also said they don’t think there has been a misconduct by the committee. We have trusted the SGAC and the authors have said they don’t think there is misconduct. It would be appropriate to remedy the decision if there was an unfair process, but that is not what is bringing up. I think this resolution being brought up to senate is really inappropriate. It should be brought to the committee. 
	•	Alec: Yes we have these people who are our representatives, but Noah didn’t campaign on Senate Seat collection, so I don’t think our voices are really heard in this process. We trust the funding committee to make decisions, but we ultimately make decisions. 
	•	PQ
	•	Passes. 15-13-8
	•	Old Business: SR1415-10: Supporting Higher Education Affordability and Illinois MAP Grants
	•	Erik: The current Illinois budget has significantly cut funding even though interest has only increased. Other Illinois schools have also passed things like this. This would put it on our docket to lobby when we go to Springfield. 
	•	Alec: What do you mean by not much support? 
	•	Erik: I’m talking monetarily. Higher ed in general has experienced many cuts. 
	•	Noah: Why does this carve out an exception for for-profit universities? 
	•	Erik: Giving this money to for-profit universities is just a way of siphoning money right into business. Also for-profit universities do not necessarily have the interests of their students at heart. 
	•	Alec: Do you think it’s almost hypocritical for students at Northwestern with a huge endowment to be taking this money? 
	•	Erik: I think in general this is to benefit all colleges and universities, particularly public universities. 
	•	Alec: What about Illinois’s general deficit? 
	•	Erik: We are advocating what is best for our constituency, which is the student body, so that’s not necessarily relevant. 
	•	Kevin: What is the current level funding for MAP grants? 
	•	Erik: Before cuts it was at $410 million and it was cut to $370 million. 
	•	In line for debate
	•	Alec: I definitely support taking funding from for-profit universities, but the current proposal holds it steady and I do not support asking for more when the fiscal situation of Illinois is so poor. 
	•	Noah: 15% increase is a lot, but compared to the deficit it is not large. And the impact it would have on students will be quite significant. I think on net the impact is going to be way more than the slight increase. 
	•	Alec: I absolutely agree with you, but you can say that about anything in the budget. 
	•	Moira: The fact that we are entertaining a sensitivity for the larger budget when we are supposed to help students is laughable. We do not need to tell them everything that they should do with their budget. They don’t have someone advocating for students, so we should do that to the best of our ability. 
	•	Motion to Previous Question. 
	•	Objection. 
	•	Noah: I think we’re good to vote. 
	•	Passes. 
	•	Legislation passes. 
	•	Roll Call and Adjournment
Associated Student Government
Senate Meeting
April 4, 2012
Minutes

Ani: Thanks for being here, had a great week Exec board reports, approval of the jouranal? Exec board reports
Austin: hello everyone, s this week we have soe exciting things going on, we have the final series of ASG round tables in Harden hall with Morty Shapiro, the goal is for Non-ASG memebers, its supposed to be an environment for people who wouldn’t normally have a conversation with him. Send out the list serve blast. Its also in some of the annoucememnts. Also, we have a speaker, its co-sponcership with MUSAC in Medill, a media related person in Harris 107. This person has been quite the leaders and it is a very unique opportunity. The sweatshirts came in, let me know, I will pass them out. The final announcememnt, is about the UVPC, apps are due this Friday. The UVPC, according to NBN, is a more powerful organization than ASG. There is some validity to that
Girish: hey guys, it serves as a voice for the population in the budgeting process. Every fall we do a campus brain storm and talk with anyone that wants to talk to us to see what students want on campus. Grant money for student clubs, trips, wifi, cell upgrades, all of that has come out of this fall process. Hopefully you all have filled out the survey, it typically gets around 2000 responces. At the end of the winter we present this to the board and it has been a really good experience for me. The app is due Friday at 5
Austin: on thing to note is that the presentation is quite significant, you are on the same level as the Deans. Getting ideas for a campus brainstorm, it is a really goood opportunity to meet with a really diverse group of people. Freshman and sophomores, you should apply it’s a great opportunity
Girish: don’t let time being a restrictive opportunity, 
David: clarify how ASG and this groups mission converge
Girish: ASg pushes for what the students want to do, UVPC presents a tangible budget request that can really happen
Austin: so both are focused on serving students, ASG goes about it in intangible ways. UVPC attaches a dollar sign to that
David: ASG considers policy and programs
Girish; UVPC doesn’t suggest policy, we will be coming back in a month once our report comes back, look forward to that. My eec board report, another joint exec board report, arts alliance and special O are approved as a status groups. 
Lauren: It’s a big deal hearins were an hour and a half each. Those two groups went from having 2.57% of funds to 95% of funds!
Girish: 2 weeks ago, we opened an investigation on Hillel for not publishing their magazine, and we have a new candidate for replacement for Ani. 
Brandon: if you are not hearing your name called or getting list serve e-mails please let me know
David: one, cell phone rental program, they are in the mail/ they came today. Hopefully youll see some marketing for that but it may be delayed bc its coming from Norris. Job cat is launching next Wednesday. Opening up north beach May 1 instead of memorial day and turning on the fountains earlier and I think it’s a really good way to celebrate our campus this spring
Ani: one quick report on the state of senate, we have 10 vacant seats, as you can see we are working on it. As new senators come in we are going to put them through a more intensive training process but well get there and promise to make senate a better experience for everyone involved. 
Mark: with a whopping white ballot majority there will be a new caucus whip: Paul. 
Paul: I am excited to serve in this position, I am the rainbow alliance 
Mark: I am stepping down because I don’t have time, and I think it’s a healthy thing for whips to transition while I am still in senate to help get things get rolling in the fall. 
Ani: if new senators could introduce themselves:
(intros)
Ian: motion to overturn 22 and 23
Ani: that’s not in order 
Ani: were going to confirm the newest member of SAFC
Terence: I am a junior, this is my third year in senate and I have served in a number of committes on senate, I was looking for a committee to apply from, I had to leave SGC, looking to get back fully into the grove of things. I thought this would be a a good committee for me. I thought that this was a power hungry organization but my thoughts on that have thus changed
Ash: this is obviously a huge committee do you have the time to juggle this commitment
Terrrence: Funding is comming up, I have been preparing for funding. I am a member of 3 frats that don’t meet very regularly. During the week I am a member of Pulse that meets once a week and Wednesday I have senate. I am doing an academic internship with Chicago field study. 
Ani: for new senators, they audit the 40 A Status groups that receive the lions share of the 1.4 million dollars delegated to senate. In early may we will vote on how much each group receives
X: can you talk about your experience with Sofo?
Terrence: I have been trained from other student groups, I am being trained next Tuesday. I was a group exec so I am familiar. 
Ani: we will go to a vote on confirmation
(passed)
the next general order is a presentation on legal services
David: I would have asked Ani to be here for our presentation but now hes speaker. A new program, legal services FAQ, a valuable way for students to turn to a centralized resource we have provided a set of common questions with well researched answers. Why should I care? A minor legal problem can turn into a huge bill, the kind of project services likes to focus on how can we use our resources to help students solve their problems. Is this reliable? All this info is sourced with additional resources. Were not lawyers, we just want to help you get started. 
	Examples…..
Asg.northwestern.edu/legal advise. We are sending a link out to media we hope this gets press, the best way for these things to succeed is word of mouth
X: how are they going to ensure that this continues to get press. 
David: we are overhauling the web site, we are gong to ensure that students are accustomed to checking that out. And you guys are responsible for keeping this alive as well and if you guys think that there is something we missed we are heppy to get that in there as well
Ani: Joe was supposed to present to us the budget for next year but she isnt here, were going to move onto new business, we have a stand in for the new author
Mark. Authorship speech for 3 minutes, make it old busniess and we can talk about it next week
Brandon: Aaron and Lindsay Baranco are going to a conference next week, its for living on campus more cheaply
Ani: any questions? If not this goes into old business for next week. Were going to move onto a bill that was on the agenda from a few weeks ago and it is now back
Mark: we talked about this a month ago brought forward by SEED, to form a committee to incentivise student groups to be more sustainable in their practices. It was something I wanted to eplore in a smaller group. I want to talk to senate about what were doing and present legislation to senate in a few weeks
Ash: what do you see this process looking like?
Mark: most of our waste is coming from the resources were drawing from. Improve office culture and were looking to see what mechanism 3. What are practices 2. Looking for normative practices
Ash: is this looking for a problem you have found or is it investigative
Mark: the former, there are a lot of things we can do much better my hope is to find out what those are and encourge groups to do this
X: would you be interested in putting a date into this bill to solidify the bill for when and where to elect this committee. Motion to amend to strike the line saying that they will be elected in the following senate and to insert a date for when to elect the committee. 
Mark: lets say by May 2nd
Ani: is there a second for that motion? Thank you victor shou, if you are looking at the agenda, at the bottom of the page, the author would like to elect at this senate and a date for when the committee would come back and update senate as to the progress of the committee. All in favor of this amendment?
(passed)
this bill now reads without the last clause and has may 2nd as the next date. 
Are there any further questions on the bill
(motion to previous question – seconded)
Any objections
(seeing none)
Skipping debate and going on to the bill all in favor to approving the bill?
(passes)
revert to our general order to vote on creating this group. Opening the floor to nominations. One must be a student groups senator, the other can be any senators
(nominations)
Ani: these are far less formal than standing committees, they work on their own scheduals and it’s a great way to get to know SGC. 
David: Someone motion to white ballot. 
Victoria: motion to white ballot
Ani: were not gonna ask them question, we will accept them as they are? Any objections to white ballot. All in favor?

SL11-12-22 Senator Training, Old Business
Victor: this goes to the heart of the issue, of you have no idea of what is going on. Senator training, there are two elements that I am proposing to help familiarize yourself to senate, 1. Legislation writing, the rules committee works on revising legislation so that it is ready for legislation. We also run the judicial board, we want to help you guys with legislation writing so we can help pass legislation to make NU a better place and so we can help yo make a better impact. For specific details it wold be effective immeadiatly and require new senators to come to a training session. 
Mark: why is this being proposed now?
V: I have spoken to Brandon about it…
Mark: this wouldn’t be an immediate change 
Victor: the end of the quarter
Ash: do you see this being a group training session?
Voctor: I see it as a model that would train everyone and then go home and write something and the Rules committee would look at it and provide feedback so senators feel prepared. 
Ani: quick note, is there a date for when rules will tell senate when they will talk about progress. 
X: Motion to Amend, include a line that the second to last senate of quarter rules would come in and update which senators ave completed this requirement so they have time to come to one meeting before the end of the quarter
Ani: all in favor of this amendment please say Ay
(passes)
We are in line for pro con. Any pros?

Old Busniess: Senator Handbook
Victor: the second part of senator training, we propose a senator handbook, there is a pre existing one but it does not prepare a senator in an adequate way. This bill forms a writing team that is responsible for writing one by the end of the quarter. Ians concern is that we should wait bc senators are new, I argue that considering that these guys are new we need to start working on it immediately. The handbook will include a bunch of sections that cover the parliamentary procedures.. etc. the pr committee would be responsible for making the handbook presentable and the whips would be responsible for including info relevant to their caucus. Revised draft done by 8th week. Final by 10 period. 
Ash: realistically is the timeline feasible given the fact that spring is a transional time, in genral is this the right time to do this effectively, 
V: I think I must be done, and there isnt a way around that, if we need more people to work on it we can be flexible and include that. I think it’s a matter of expanding on what has already been done. A lot of it is just aggregating info, not writing new stuff. 
Mark: parliamentary body, do you think that you are prepared to submit adequate information
Brandon: yes I think I could, 
Victor: I think there needs to be something in by the end of the quarter
Girish: would you want Lauren or I to be on the committee
V: ts just a matter of getting information from you guys
Ani: were going to move into a debate. 15 min is a lot of time, if it doesn’t last that long it doesn’t last that long. Raise your hand for a pro or con speech for 2 min. If you like this bill and would like to speak on behalf of it you may do to. Con speech
Mark: I think the heart of this bill is in the right place but I don’t think there has been enough homework done yet, I think letting people settle into their rolls would be beneficial. 
Ash: when would the right time be?
Mark: it doesn’t make sense for fresh parliamentary body to have to do this, I think the executive vp who is currently ruling should be responsible. I am proposing to table this for 2 weeks. Until the exec board transition is complete
Ani: any other pro speeches
David: I think that this is the perfect time to do it the parliamentary body is fully capable, jusyt bc it is in the middle of the presidential election. I think sooner is better than later, its better to take a handle on it now. Not fair to punish people for being in the middle of a campaign. 
Ash: question to the author, would you be comfortable making it such that I will start in this process and the new VP would accept the responsibility as they transition
V: it is important to know who is responsible so those who have the time to do this should be the ones responsible
David: senate often delays things, its better to do things sooner rather than later
V: people in the positions now can pass on responsibility
Ani: con speech? We are in the second round
Mark: to address what david said, I would argue that legislation we delay, there is a learning curve for this, they do not have enough experience. 
David: do you think its prudent, there are 10 new senators now and there will be 10 in 2 weeks .
Mark: we need to have people who have experience in their respective positions to do this in a successful ways. 
Mark: you need buy in from everyone who would be involved and that isnt what I am seeing. 
Ani: if you are typing on your comp then youre not looking at the adgenda, that’s thee only reason why you should have that in front of you. Another pro speech? If you want to introduce yourself:
Dana: we spoke about this in dorm caucus today, we were thinking that most of the weight of this would fall on our project, it doesn’t seem that daunting when we divide it. Were not in transition. We don think exec transition will effect this as much. Writing the manual would fall on dorm senators caucus
V: do you want to amend this to include a bigger role for RHA/RCB caucus. 
Dana: yes, 
V: since the responsibilities are not delegated. 
Mark: I was caucus whip for student groups caucus, this is your first senate as a whip, we had 6 people show up to caucus, we are in deep transition, I will find it very challenging to write anything because we are in transition. 
Brad: why do you think in 5 weeks it would be more beneficial to wait until everyone is COMPLETELY new
Mark: why was the legislation brought before senate in the midst of transition
David: can you remember a time when there are not a lot of transition
Mark: winter quarter. 
Ani: we are now moving into a vote on the bill itself. 
(point of clarification: all four caucus whips would be engaging their own caucuses)
Ani: all in favor
(passes)
Ani: good of the order: new senators, I am going to start meeting with you 3 at a time so keep an eye out for that, it will be in the point of a google doc. I took a quarter to transition but I will help none the less
Ash: there is a campaign going on, I want to let you know there are debates going on so I encourage all of you to go and to educate yourself on what is going on. Hopefully I will see you guys at some of these debates. 
Amalia:  mondayat 6, there is going to be a KONY effect panel to talk about what happened with the whole Kony effect 
David: project cookie is operating tonight, and forever, a late night cookie service, inception cookie, a cookie within a cookie. Follow us on twitter. Were not doing official recruitment, but were hiring, 
Tori: 15 dollars for A and O tickets
X: GES is next week, thurs fri sat
Ani: were gonna move into exec board reports, a quick update. I have been meeting with new senators, great meetings, thank you, I think that I have heard a lot of great ideas. Sophia had a great one where senators meet for coffee. We want to have a room of people who like each other. In terms of filling seats, were vetting thoroughly people to represent dorms who want to be a part of senate that want to take on projects and represent constituents well. If there is something you would like to express in person, please let me know. Questions? Any other exec reports
Ash: two things, Betsey Burns is looking for 2 sophomores to serve on the Athletic Departments wellness committee. One meeting per quarter. I need a female interested. Also, were putting together a list of accomplishments to show the students at large what we have accomplished and hopefully well have that ready by next Wednesday and hopefully that will benefit you guys to get a feel of what you can do and where were going?
Lauren: we are starting the Spring Leadership Training; if you have any input, please let me know. I would love to hear your ideas, it’s a big idea, its all the Presidents and Treasurers, if you have any suggestions. Next week I should be coming with more new groups, in a week there will be more T status. 
Girish: We talked about Hillel misconduct. That’s next Tuesday we are also investigating FMO
Austin:  Doctor Tayas Irvin, is starting up the police advisory board, were looking for senators to be a part of that. If you’re interested or know anyone who would want to be serving in this, also on Monday there is a speaker coming in sponsored by USA today. Mark Zinga is coming in. It’s a ASG student affairs are all sponsoring it and it’s the only one they are sponsoring nationally. 
Ani: The point of this spreadsheet is for you to be able to contact your fellow senators

Were going to move onto the ASG operating budget, it is in the range of 40000 dollars, it’s the money we have to spend as a student group. 

Were gonna wait for the operating budget and move into JobCat. 
Were moving the legislation up
(passed)

Lindsay: I am going to DC next week to represent sorority and fraternity members to lobby for more affordable housing. Its not just for Greek life, its any non profit student housing due to a loop hole that doesn’t allow non profits to donate and still maintain their tax exemptions. This will effect all college students so the university’s wont have to pay for these things. In the next 10 years we have to make handicap ramps and elevators so this will allow people to donate. I am asking for your support. 
Ian: is there anything we can do as individuals to support this
Lindsey: this is mainly just in support of the proposal
Ani: any other questions. This is a resolution, this doesn’t require ASG to act on anything. This is an expression of support, were speaking on behalf of the student body. 
Motion to PQ
Move to a vote

please fill out the spreadsheet
Back to the JobCat presentation
David: We have put a lot of time into this and I would appreciate your attention. Job cat is Launched and Live! We have been working on this since fall. What is Job cat? It connects residents with students for short term employment, it’s a one stop shop for NU students to connect with residents. We have put in  a lot of time to make this successful. Here it is. Or you could submit to the ad on the right because a resident is already ready to hire. We have done very minimal but a little PR in Evanston, we designed this to be as easy as possible, it hasn’t been tested and were looking for feedback so please let us know. Why should NU students use this? Its free! Evanston will be on JobCat, were really good at reaching out to Students at NU but its hard to reach out to Evanston residents, over the coming weeks you will see us putting a lot of energy into reach them. You want to give back to Evanston, this makes more of an incentive for us to demonstrate to them what we can do for them. Mark Whitty said that Adam Smith would be proud. Why should Evanston use this? We have worked really hard to get this, when they hire us they know we are hard and reliable workers. Craigs list has gone through very few changes in the past 15 years. We have a tech VP who is up to date and knowledgeable. Its easy and free to get connected. Some features to be aware of: log in with your net ID. You can make a profile, or upload a mini biography and a resume. You can comment on a student or job. Browse jobs by most recent, category, or minimum pay. You can preference jobs. You can protect your privacy. You don’t have to e-mail them directly. Safety guidelines. It is up to you to be responsible, call the residents ahead of time possibly carry pepper spray and there is a box check that requires students to look at the guidelines, will anyone use it? We are urging you guys to get involved and promote this. Were not good at standing behind out products. We want you guys to take ownership of Jobcat like AO and Mayfest do. Well give you easy instructions, in principle you are ASG and JobCat is ASG. How do we get people to use a social network if people aren’t using it? People don’t want to be on something that other people are not on. We need you to be those first people! Please tell your Northshore friends. Please challenge them to be involved. We have flyers were posting in public Evanston places. We reached out to public schools, church groups, and PTI has agreed to post it in their sites. We have contact with Evanston publications that are not NU affiliated. City of Evanston Newsletter.  Please use the power of Word of Mouth. Thank you so much Ethan Ramba. The services committee a thanks to them as well. This is the kind of stuff that ASG is good at. 
Ian: where is the money coming to flyer this?
David: the ASG publicity fund. 
Ani: now, we have a special announcement
Francis Brooke: the most important election, Willie Wonka 
For student life: Alex Van Atta won with 55%. AVP: Neil won 52% There will be a run off between 46% Victor and Brad, Cam and Steven got 36%
Ani: runoff is triggered when no candidate has a majority
Ani: lets take a moment to thank the election commission, voting in the run off will happen on Friday the 13th, so dig in for some more campaigning. 
Ash: to give you guys a run down, the ASG budget has to get approved by senate, it comes out of the student activities funds. We want to show you the recommendations we made based on what we spent this year and what we think is necessary for the coming year… 
Austin: for the 5k, ultimately, we would like to ultimately make that 15K
Ani: please don’t publicize this yet, its not confirmed
Austin: its just a “k” initiative. We know for sure there is at least 5000 dollars
X: about the food trucks, you said you were going to do it on a quarterly basis
Ash: we haven’t decided how many times were going to do that, its up to the new administrations. Its an ASG DM co sponsorship. 
Jo: right now we have only budged 400 for it,
Ani: the SAF cannot use money for food, 
Austin: the biggest request we got were trashcan places to sit and clean up
Ani: are there any questions or proposed amendments, seeing none were going to move to a vote
Ash: again, its 46400$ and the jump is mostly due to the 5k
Ani: all in favor?
(passed)
Good of the order
Mark: next week is earth week and were accumulating a pile of garbage. Its on Sunday of Next week. 
Satirios, its autism awareness month
Austin: another cool opportunity, joining the dillo day task force, you meet with cool people to make dillo day even better, we need 5 ASG volunteers. Its once a week for an hour. This coming Wednesday is the veritas forum in pick it’s a debate between faith and science and its moderated by a cool NU person. 
Ian: GES has cool events coming up
Ani: if you cold please fill out the document online, any other questions?
Roll Call. 

ASG Senate
April 18, 2012

Ani: so were gonna go ahead, exec board reports, this new arrangement will be permanent and exec will sit on this side. If anyone is not here you will be able to see that they are missing
Austin: please read my report, this past Monday we had the CEO reform with Mark Pinkus come with USA today. And so, they loved that we co sponsored it with them and they gave us a nice trophy. This will be in the office, 
David: so thanks again for all who were here for the launch of job cat were really excited about the friction we have gained, with a little over 100 users. Last senate I asked you guys to make a profile and no senators did. Raise your hand if you did, Ideally you guys would be posting a job if you made a profile. Its more important though that you tell your Evanston friends about it. Tell your professors, I really encourage you guys to do that. We want to guard the rock but we got beat to it. It has gotten some really good publicity, thanks for your support and keep it up
Steven: tomorrow night, Stephanie Hong is supporting STICHES new event, Spring Spree, NU Fashion night, were sponsoring STICH and unity, were connecting them with a lot of retailers and a bunch of coupons and deals are available for the entire weekend. 
Lauren: apps are out for SGC, we have already gotten a lot of interest so I would love to get some apps from Senators. We work with B and T status groups, and we put on the fall activities fair and that’s a big deal for freshman and spring leadership training for all the new presidents and treasures and were responsible for validating all new student groups. If you want to become powerful…
Brandon: consider running for rules and read my exec board report
Ani: couldn’t print agendas today, the printer is broken.

The first general order of tonight, we have a packed agenda, the first up is the diversity committee, we vote to create it a few weeks ago
Jazzy: glad to be here, I have come to think of this committee as the child of ASG and the coalition of colors, because it will effect the community. I think of this team as the dream team and have confidence in them, we got 21 applicants, I want to introduce you to the chair, Haley, 
Haley: I will be working as the chair, we held interviews last week if yall wanna come up and introduce yourselves, its unclear whether they will have individual roles
	Sophia, Ian, Anchal, Diamond, MJ, Sarah, Nora, Peter
Much of what were gonna be doing is centralizing the issues that have been going on this year is to consolidate the issues that have been going on this year. Were working with the academic requirement committee and were going to be working on that, we asked the admin to release the diversity report by april 30. 
David: are you optimistic about the report?
Haley: I am this is something they have and have chosen not to release. They have had nearly 3 and a half weeks
Jazzy: were meeting with Lindsor and Cudeurvo,
Wilson: how do you plan on interacting with NU’s new sources if at all
Haley: we have already begun but we plan to as they come
Ani: we forgot to mention that we have to confirm the senators on the committee if we could have the senators step forward for questions
Sophia: I have been involved with it since January I think its important in terms of inclusion, its very relevant
Ian: I want to be on this committee because I want to take things I have seen on campus and use it with the committee and use it to make some impact this year
Ani: all in favor of confirming these senators:
(passed)
5 k initiative update
Austin: it is underway, we have been in communications with NUIT and we have a map to show you were the internet coverage should go on the south point of the lakefill, the access point is based on reganstein, on the top of the building so that the trees, there are some trees that will block the internet from getting to the east wings, so the fire pit is at the top of the map and we talked about getting access all the way out to there, but its not feasible. 
Wilson” how much data or how many users can access this?
Austin: I don’t think there will be a very stric limit
Mark: I notice there is a large trunk that extends into the lake, is there a more efficient way to get more land and less lake covered?
Austin: he said moving it up would actually make the trees block more of it. 
Sarah Brock: are we not concerned that the water has stronger covered than the land?
Ash: there is nowhere else to put the router where it would be better. 
Wilson: are we concerned about long term exposure to the fish in the water?
Austin: we talked to the NUIT today, the police are looking into installing a camera out there and this wireless would be extended along the fill but there are a ton of unknowns about their expected installation, but we could potentially combine with them and double this system. But that project is hypothetical and so if they don’t get back to us then we will move ahead on that. 
X: what is the instillation date?
Austin: we said may 1st, but they said probably the third week in may. But were waiting to hear back from the police which is pushing it back. 
Matt: are we using the whole budget?
Austin: yes
Ani: the ASG term end presentation
Ash: we want to present you guys what ASG has worked on this year on behalf of the exec board, the idea is not to promote our own agendas, the goal is to get things done and its important that everyone in this room knows what we were able to accomplish. Starting with our initial goal:
Austin” to echo ash, this is not touting, we want to be accountable to the students. Giving context: ASG exists to create connections… and experience. It was a way to focus and make sure what were doing is relevant. 
Ash: basically after reflecting on what we could accomplish we focused on new traditions, strengthening relations with Evanston, 
Austin: we met with DR Teas Irving, she came from U F which has a lot of traditions, and we wanted to have similar ones here. The 5K, roundtables with university officials, engaging leadership series, asg is perfectly positioned to help develop leaders at NU, the ASG and NUDM food truck festival and there is now funding to have that at least 2 times a year. And we are looking to have that cosponsored with other groups. 
ASH: services and resources, some of the major ones we had included the housing fair, cell phone rental program, laptop chargers in the library, legal counseling FAQ, wildcat pad, which is the online sublet site. 
Austin: student life and academic initiatives, including yoga classes, MLK day that was really bolstered by the finance committee, deering doors, and you can see some of the other ones going on, meal plan and shuttle reform, the housing fair
Ash: community relations, big bight night. The city light walk where the committee identifies areas that are poorly lit, the student protest working group that Steven and mark were able to muster a lot of interest by other schools, the landlord licensing committee was a huge step in the right direction with the brothel law, spring spree, which is tomorrow and further connects us with Evanston in general
Austin Programming, annual wildcat tailgate and T shirt exchange
ASH: Student group support 1.2 million dollars were funded to groups, server clean up, student group apportionment committee in senate, wanted to make sure the most number of groups were represented in senate, the next one is engagement with administrator and trustees. Student alumni interaction, distinguished secondary teaching committee. 
Austin: university committees, you can see a plethora of those that senators already sit on and they are open throughout the year. Contact Brad if you are interest and he will tell you if there is an available spot. The last one is organizational improvements: some of these involve a lot of senate reform measures that we are enhancing even further this year. Senate improvement, dorm elections, ASG brand improvement which gave a fresh face to our continued focus on students. Hot chocolate chats and all ASG meetings. 
ASH: there will still projects that we weren’t able to finish, the new student center, railsford and dunley which is a consulting firm, they are doing a comprehensive assessment about the possibility of getting a new center and hopefully they realize as we all realize that we need a new student center. We have put this all together in 5 pages and it will be present to the student body and if they are interested in knowing what we have accomplished please share this with them. 
Ani: okay great were going to move right into electoral confirmation, were going to have the election commission chair come up and speak about the electoral procedure, and then we will move into confirmation. 
Francis: we had a pretty smooth process, we had all the candidates get signatures, go through the rules, we have a few complaints about chalking, we had a great turn out about 38000 in the first and 3300 in the second vote
Wilson: what kind of procedures exist when we find out that spray chalking is not water soluble and the election has already happened. 
Mark: what are your thoughts about preferential voting
F: there were a lot of people who didn’t vote, I think when students are not well informed they tend not to vote so I am hesitant to encourage that. 
Mark: what’s the different between abstention and no comment, no confidence, if there are more no confidence than other votes than those people cannot be elected. 
Ani: were gonna move into a vote to certify the election process
(passed)
were gonna move into confirmations
Gabby to Neil Mehtta. 
Gabby: this is my last day of my 3 years, but I have really enjoyed it I have done it all, this is weird bc I am a senior and there are a lot of unfamiliar faces and I just hope you all have a great experience. I wish Neal a lot of luck, its hard work and it can be a very thankless job. But its what you got to do…

(confirmed)

Gabby: Im an engineer so I don’t have a lot to say, but I didn’t really know what I was getting into when Matt Bellasai swore me in but take your job seriously, talk to your constituents, but make things happen because you got a lot of power. 
Alex Van Atta

(confirmed)

Ash: thank you, for a great year, it’s a tough job and there were a lot of hard times but there were a lot of times where I think I did good and the organization did good. All in all its been a great year for helping to make that happen

(confirmed)

Austin:so I did write a little something, okay being student body president is much like a coloring book you start with the outline design the mission to serve students but you are given free reign for how to color it in the lines. This year has been so colorful the lessons learned have revealed to me how to grow as a friends and as a leader, to starting co sponsorships. I am so thankful for this year, above all, I like to remember to that who you are precludes who you are, it is your character that matters most I want to see all of you grow as leaders and friends, thank you everyone for an amazing year. God bless and make it matter. 

Victor: I am so grateful to be able to serve you all I think this organization is fantastic and I think we can do a lot of great things and I think we have the people here to do and we look forward to doing it. Thank you all and get excited. 

Ani: next up is the dorm senator election commission
Brandon: each year a commission is elected, as a committee we look over the election guidelines we figure out ways to advertise for the commission, it is open up to any senator. 
Ani: this years elections will be better, expect this to be a substantial role and to work with some big leaders and I encourage you to nominate yourself or nominate others. 

Mitoki accepts
Ian respectfully declines
Mark respectfully declines
Henry Brooke respectfully declines
Sarah Brock accepts
Matt Bellasai respectfully declines

Mitoki: hi im mitoki im a junior electrical engineer I have been a senator for two and a half years but I think that dorm senators need a really nice elections and I think I can help rha rcb out I am already in contact with them about a lot of stuff
Sarah: econ major, greek caucus, I want to do this bc I think recruitment is important and its good to have a great group of people here
Ian: what dorms have you lived in here and what was your experience like. 
Sarah: I lived in Bobb and I don’t remember recruitment
Motoki: I lived in sergeant and 626 emerson, in sergeant there were two people running and it was the only time there were more than one person running in a dorm, this year I was a write in 
Wilson: this job requires a lot of time in the beginning of the school year and leading into the school year, 
Motoki: ill be here doing research during the year, so I’ll be here early. 
Sarah: I move in two weeks early because I am in charge of my sorority and helping move my sister in
Girish: you alluded to the process and that it is somewhat of a joke, do you guys have any ideas for how to make this a more competitive process. 
Motoki: I think we need to push on the prestige of the position. We are dealing with large sums of money and a large body of people and I think there is prestige we can push and I think that’s how we get people interested
SARAG: I think this has to do with PR, there must be lots of students coming to NU that have dealt with student government in the past
Wilson: motion to white ballot

(passed)
Ani: incidentally the dorm senator election committee is being voted in early to work on materials
Up next is Hillel investigation for misconduct
Girish:Hillel and FMO discussed their failure to publish, we reached a discussion on Hillel which was to approve misconduct. Shmooze is a very highly regarded publication. There was not a lot of internal interest. Last year they did not have a fall winter or spring publication and they were funded for it. They waved the right to have a hearing and recognized their misconduct and so we don’t need you guys to vote on it. You guys can ask me any questions and you guys can have a pro con
Girish: the only repercussions are that they have to give the funding back
X: the money wasn’t spent?
Girish: they did nothing with the money
Wilson: motion to previous question
Ani: any objections
Were gonna move to a vote to approve the misconduct
(passes)
Rules committee elections

Brandon: we overlook rules each week, its composed of 6 senators, and usually 3 are elected in the fall and 3 in the spring but given circumstances were electing 5 now. It’s a great committee and if you feel that you haven’t been understanding how this works, it’s a great opportunity
Ani: if your considering it for now think of it as a trial . the two seats we are doing now are only for this quarter. 

Dana accepted
Henry Brooke accept
Justin accepted
Mark Silberg accept
Abby accept
Paul accept

(motion to move the more permanent positions now)
(passed)
were gonna open up the nomination process again

Henry Brooke

Sophomore student athlete representative, I want to be on rules because I want to be influential in designing legislation and on disciplinary action in senate
Paul
I want to be on rules because all legislation has to go through rules I want to make sure everything is coherent and worth being here for
Mark (decline)
Dana Lineback 
Freshman in Weinberg from sergeant I have been here for 2 quarters, I love roberts rules but I don’t know much about the legislative process I have never been on a official 
Katie Funderberg 
I would like to learn more about the legislation writing process
Justin
This is going to be my last year and I want to be more active in my last year. 

Wilson: some people cant write and don’t know it, how can you suggest changes that would be strong enough
Henry: I would be good at suggesting in a polite way more coherent stuff and I wouldn’t allow anything bad to come through and I really don’t want that to happen
Paul: I would like to go through with people point by point, I would say to add a personal touch directly with the person who is writing. 
Dana: most of my experience comes from high school, I was the editor and chief of the high school news paper, and I understand that people are very attached to things they write and it is all about the way you approach it and the relationship you form in the first few minutes
Katie: I was an English tutor in high school and it teaches you how to edit stuff without making people feel bad, point out why things are unclear rather than why its bad
Justin: I have worked on the daily, and Im a poli sci major so I am used to writing. 

Victor: what other ASG commitments do you guys have 
Paul: I am the Student groups caucus whip but that’s it
Dana: rha senator, working on the handbook, should be done next week, im on the ad hoc committee for the unofficial student guide
Katie: since the election is over all I have is the ad hoc committee for transportation
Justn: I am on services committee, not involved too much on what were doing so far with off campus
Henry: I was on the election committee

Ian: have you ever written or sponsored a piece of legislation
Dana: no
Katie: yes
Justin: no
Henry: no
(candidates leave the room)

Wilson: throughout my experience on rules, in the four years of senate, I have been approached by all of them because they had question because they wanted to help and that’s a great thing. I also think that X would satisfy this role well
Mary Kate: endorsing X, she has done a great job in writing by herself
X: we should consider voting for someone who does not have a lot of experience 
Brandon: don’t let someone who has written dissuade you because of that
David: endorsing X, I have worked with him in the past, I can count on him
Francis: speaking on behalf of X and X, on the election committee, they were both very responsible and they work very hard and would take it very seriously. 
X: I would like to speak on behalf of X, especially with very big commitments they are able to multitask while managing senate classes and sports, I would highly recommend X
Wilson: I started off as a freshman with no experience as well
(motion to close the debate period)
(passed)
Ani: Open your laptops.  I give you permission.  Do you have it open?  You don’t have to open your own laptop.  Meet with Senators in your group.  I want you guys to be friends.  Groups were arranged randomly/alphabetically.
Victoria: Why am I not in a group?
Ani: You didn’t fill out the survey.  Feel free to join a group.
(take time to talk with your groups until results are in)
results are in, Brandon will announce 
Brandon: the winners are Katie, paul and henry. 
Ani, were gonna move into the elections for the two remaining spots, who will serve the rest of the quarter and be up for the election again in the fall

Dana: I still want to be on rules for the same reasons
Justin: im Justin

Ian: will you seek a longer term if elected
Abby: im gone in the fall and I will reapply in the winter if possible
Dana: yes
Justin: absolutely

Wilson: what would your favor roberts rule be
Dana: point of information its always misused
Justin: I don’t have one
Abby: they all are wonderful, I would say motion to white ballot.

Motoki: what are your commitments this quarter
Justin: im on services
Abby: just finished up elections committee, im in design for America
Dana: most of my things are finishing up, just pledged AXO
(motion to close debate period and candidates exit)

Wilson: get X in here early
Motoki: im gonna speak on behalf on X, she really wants to get involved in ASG I tried to talk her into SGC but I think she wants rules
X: I  think X works really hard, she would be a great addition
Francis: X is really responsible 
Girish: he has been super involved, hes looking for ways to be even more involved. 
David: X is on my committee, 
(motion to close debate period)
Ani: How many midterms do people have?
(groans)
Ani: While its being counted, we’re going to move on.  Four pieces of new business.  
Ani: Legislation – enhancing PR senate involvement
David: Want to codify senator involvement with PR.  PR committee is clearly a cornerstone of the offerings but it is not fair to mandate that they do all of the work.  Their energy should be more focused on strategy and graphic design.  Every other student group on campus has more ability to say to their members that they want them to participate in flyering.  Second, we need to develop an ASG in which we all take ownership over our initiatives.  It needs to be on all of us to make that initiative become successful.  I’m asking you to take on a new responsibility.  Its only one hour per quarter which is minimal in the scheme of things.
Becca: We are working on thinking of new methods other than flyering.  Right now, flyering is the biggest way to advertise on campus.  It would be a couple flyers per person rather than 6 people having to spend hours to cover all of campus.
David: We are often accused of having bad PR.  A lot of it has to do with the fact that we’re all not publicizing and participating in our own events.  
Wilson: How would this transfer over for senators who leave or are replaced?  Is it the seat or the person? If you were a senator for the first week, I don tink that person is necessarily off the hook, I think we have a judicial system for a reason. Yeah we were saying in exec today that there are a number of systems in place, there could be a sign in and sign out, we could simply institute something that would solve these problems. 
I would support legislating that method so once you’re gone it will stay in place. 
David: I think that it is up to 
X: the greek caucus finds the 2 absences as too harsh, 
David: I don’t want there to be leeway, if a senator was up for review it would be up to rules to make a specific decision that accounts for something like that. And again we spoke in exec and someone said to me that this it too strict, but review should happen on a case by case basis
Justin: we had to fire for jobcat would this double commit?
David: this is just a requirement that you have to advertise for one hour
Jane: what are you counting as an hour, are you going by event hours or hour hours, 
Becca: its going to be on an event by event basis,
David: its about the intent, if you’re asked to flyer 3 places and your done in 40 min than you’re done. 
Mitoki: is this for all ASG committee members or just senators?
David: this is the way that I see to take the body that I see doing the least amount of this grunt work and getting them engaged. 
Tori: what if there are less jobs than there are people?
David: that would be at the rules committee’s discretion. I also don’t foresee that being an issue, and if it is, then there are deeper problems. Its about publicizing ASG as an organization
Mark: how time sensitive is this?
David: its up to you, if you want to give yourself one less week to do this so be it. 
Francis: it seems like the point of this is to pull senate together, do you think it would be better to make it for any committee you’re not a part of?
David: I think we can find a solution there, I would hesitate to say that you could show up to a committee you’re not a part of. 
Mark: can I motion to make this old business?
Ani: any objections? Move to a vote, all in favor of making this old business
(passed: old business)
Ian: you do want senate to do this work but will you hold the PR committee to the same standard
Becca: this is not to say we are going to decrease our level of work but to increase our level of presence on campus. 
Wilson: motion to ending the question period. 
Ani: passed, motion to amend, I do think this is a noble cause, I do feel that there should be some statement about who is controlling what events are okay and what are not so I motion to add a line that says any event that will fulfill this body will be okayed by the parliamentary body or the PR VP. I am willing to change that to anyone on exec. This is meant to say that you must seek approval ahead of time.  
(seconded)
Ani: were gonna have a pro con period on this in a second
Motoki: this is still only related to PR work
Wilson: motion to amend everything that we just said and replacing it with any ASG committee. 
The entire thing will read “dedicating at least one hour of PR work or labor approved by the ASG exec board”
Ani: question period
Rebecca: say I do something and I help them, it wouldn’t count because I didn’t get approval
Wilson: right
Matt: don’t you think requiring people to help with publicity is different from helping with event. 
Wilson: to a lesser extent, Big Bight Night, that was the kind of thing I was doing because I wanted to help with the event. If we can tap this resource, that would be a useful thing. 
Ani: we are now going to move into pro con, each pro con shall be no more than 2 min. 
David: I would like you to pass this bill if you pass this amendment, but this is about publicity. The more rules we impose the harder this becomes to enforce and the more stringent the enforcement. I don’t think we should make this hour devoted other things than publicity. And I think its too bureaucratic to get approval ahead of time. 
Ian: this is about culture, to get people more involved generally, if were going to make a requirement we should make it easier rather than harder. Publicity will result from this
Girish: there is a huge organizational need for PR and not for events, ASG’s publicity is nothing compared to A and O. 
Wilson: why does this amendment preclude people from doing more pr work, you as an exec member has a power to veto, 
Girish: why let it get to this point
(motion to previous question)
David: hold yourself to a high standard
(passed) 
were gonna talk about the bolded questions and then talk about the bill. All in favor of amending this amendment 
(passed)
Girish: motion to amend, I want to make exec members have to comply as well,
Jane: can we amend the 2 absences to one. 
ANi: were now going to vote on whether or not to hear this proposal
(passed)
Jane: if you miss one senate, and you miss your hour you’re going to be reviewed any ways, it seems redundant to me. 
Ani: we will now move into debate
Mary Grace: pro, I support this, I think putting in 2 absences is very strict, its what we put in for absences total, it would prevent you from being a member of senate in the future
David: this is your decision, im asking you to hold yourselves accountable and to commit, its just an hour, and I think that’s such a small step and to water it down and decrease the punishment seems silly. 
Jane: you would be reviewed by exec. 
Mark: if your excuse is that you had something to do, rules committee can deal with that in their own time. We should all be held accountable. Reducing it down to one absence is silly. 
Wilson: they could have just as easily made this a senator requirement rather than punishable. SO I think this is just dealing with an aspect of the code that the authors opened themselves up to. 
Ani: another pro?
(motion to previous question)
all in favor of reducing from 2 to one
(amendment rejected, still 2 absences)
(Previous question)
move to vote on the entire bill, all in favor
(passed)
were going to move onto campaign promises
Mark: this has been edited by al four elected positions but it asks that all elected officials report to senate after their retreat. The motivation behind this is to hold people accountable to what they said they would do. 
Ani: closing the question period, it will be old business for next week. 
Mark: Speakers calendar, this sets up a google calendar that the parliamentary body wll be responsible for up keeping. I request that this becomes new business. 
Ian: are you open to working with the tech dept to get this on our site?
Ani: any questions. 
(motion to make this old business)
this is now moved to old business
Ian: is the deadline on this ASAP? When would you like to have this fully functional. 
Mark: asap
Ani: pro con
(previous question)
vote
(passed)
next item of business, services VP selection
Brad: the way the code is written right now is that services is selected by a different committee than all the other ones, so we want to strike the part of the code and ask that the services committee be grouped in with all the other VPs. 
Ian: services is supposed to be appointed by the senate. 
Brandon: the FVP and SGCVP are all in the same line and elected by senate
Brad: we would like to make this old business tonight or else it will throw off the whole system, we would like to confirm next wed. 
(motion to make it old business)
Ani: we are now in line for pro con
(motion to suspend the rules)
move to an immediate vote
(passed)
Ani: I am inspired by how well this went tonight, good job guys
Abby and Dana won the two quarter long seats. 
Ian: will you investigate a gross overcall of our code and figure out why that happened. 
Ani: its been done, they overlooked it, the people responsible left the room
(good of the order)
(roll call)
Senate 4/25
Ani: on the agenda tonight we have special visitors coming in, we have to breeze through exec reports. 
Charles Katzenmeyer is going to be coming in and talking very soon, 
David: two important announcements, the first is about committee recruitment, we would love to get more senators involved, they will come out tonight and be due Sunday
Sunday from 2-4 we will be hosting a brainstorming session and I would like to see a large turn out from senate, we will be looking at what services and resources we need to incubate, this is a really valuable opportunity or if you have be unsatisfied by something. I have made this point before, but as we create greater organizational efficacy I would really like to see you guys show up to this 
This will also go out, we will be guarding the rock for JobCat, you just passed the PR requirement, it’s a good opportunity for you guys to knock that out of the way. 
Becca: PR is brainstorming new methods for PR and so I will be having office hours in Norbucks on Friday to think of new ways to get ASG’s message out there!
Ani: I would like to introduce Mr. Katzenmeyer
Katzenmeyer: I am so grateful, alum, I have had a carrier in non-profits but for last 15 min I have worked at museums. I was president of my fraternity and several other activities I have looked for ways to stay involved. Keeping seniors involved seems to bee something that NU needs to work on. 
I am here to talk about the alumni association, each of you is here representing an organization. I am on a barn storm tour to hear as many students as possible before I turn the reigns over, I want to hear as many students as possible, so this is something I can do now, the reason we are so interested in you. NU changes. Every 10 years or so it becomes completely different. More than anything you all represent something very different. Every year our freshman class out does the one before. Were a hot school, you all are hot students, and you came to NU and I am thrilled to see that the “bitching” factor is a thing of the past. Before people had a lot to complain about here, maybe it came with the time but you guys seem to be more focused on what college is about. You are all different people. This is a far more… when I was an ASG officer, this is a far more diverse campus, and this is so much our stength now at NU, we are looking for more international students. Things are always changing and for us to be relevant as the alumni association, hopefully we will keep you all connected to NU. We want to know what you guys think we should be doing. What is our future? What is our stratigeic plan? This is all about you and the student that will come. Here are some of our programs:
A weekly e-mail NAA stat, tell me that’s not annoying? It’s a quick read please don’t unsubscribe we want to get our mechanism out there
We work with the NU class alliance
We have 2 student directors and were taking those applications right now and its great perspective about the university it’s a lot of fun we don’t push you hard so if any of you are thinking about it
Have any of you done dinner with 12 strangers? Was that a good experience?
We do career programs, were doing anything we can that you need. 
What do students need from the alumni association
If you were alums what would you be doing for the association
Steven: one of the things I think students want to see is more access to alumni as far as work, there has been a few complaints as far as UCS career services 
K: there have been plenty of alumn that have signed up for Career net, and there must be thousands of them that want to talk to students. I think they would be thrilled to have you talk to them personally. What im hearing about is that we haven’t gotten the word out, we do resume prep, and mock interviews. How about beyond careers though? 
Lauren: we have an event called NU gives back and not too many came so I think that would be a great way for alumni to get involved, 
K: the local alumni group in Chicago, we have some staff on sight that deal with that and I wrote it down. 
Matt: im about to be one of the 8 alumni who is going to be angry at everything, so maybe just speaking for the people in ASG who participate in trying to effect policy, it would be great to have some of the alum support some of the policy were trying to pass like the new student center, it is something that would effect alumni. 
K: no we had Norris and you have to have it to. Morty hears that in a big way. He gets you guys he likes you, he seems to have everyone over for dinner and if you want to, let someone know. He gets the community gathering thing in a big way. Integrating the experiences at NU and getting people to come together a little bit more. That has to do with physical spaces. I sense that the area Morty is looking at is where Kellog is now, and that building is to be retrofitted and that might be a good space for people to come together. 
Lauren: it would be nice to have info from alum to hear about what Student Groups they were in, it would be good to know all the ASG alums and theater groups, 
K: we have some of this, obviously not complete bc they have to fill it out themselves, if you were to talk to Heather Nicetep, she would be more than happy to meet with you. That is something we have been working on, how do we make these connections:
Girish: in terms of reaching out to alumni there are so many different resources that provide job prep, so something students want is a centralized resource, like UCS. 
K: our careers and networking committee is tring to add net benefit, we can replicate what theyre doing but we have to augment that and if there is something they are not doing we want to know about it. 
Being involved costs you nothing and you can really make a difference, 
Your point is not lost on me
RHA/RCS: biomedical engineer, alumni are build into the program, where we have to call them and talk to them sometimes, I don’t know how many programs have that, but I think that would be a great thing to have
K: that is the future of education, there is not only one way to learn, I am thrilled to have that in the biomed program. The opportunity to come into contact with a real student like you is a luxury. 

Ani: Senators are in the middle section of the room
A really quick note on whats happening this everning, at 8 well have an open forum about diversity inclusion, we have less than half an hour to get through all of this. I would like to get an update from dorm conditions group. A working group is a group of two or three senators who come together on an issue
Ed: we got assigned to this back in Feb and when we finally came to the conclusion that we wanted to release a survey, it was the end of the quarter. We met with TI and were gonna release a survey on facilities and a sense of community. For facilities it would be a qualitative perspective, there are problems we see every day that the administration doesn’t see. Small things like that can be important. We are encouraging everyone in this room to take the survey. 
Mark: how are you distributing it and when is it going out?
Ed: we are sending it to area coordinators and hall govts tonight
Ian: why are you 
Ed: that wasn’t something we considere Pain Kirshmeyer asked us to do it. People outside of RHA RCB might have a good understanding of community. And She wants us to do. 
Matt: who is analyzing results
Ed: between us and Student life committee, 
Matt: definitely talk to alex, we have worked in the past with ISBE and they can crunch the numbers and also work with PR to make this a campaign so we can make this something everyone fills out
Ani: ed and prathusha have done a ton of work without help from the exec board. Moving forward we will give them all the resources they need. 
The cabinet was selected last evening so we are going to swear in exec. We interviewed candidates and we decided to reappoint the candidates who already held the positions. 
Steven: I have done a lot of thinking about this position, I think we need to focus more on civic engagement and sort of jettison and move event s such as big bight night and housing committee to another committee and focus more on monthly voting registration and trying to organize meetings of housing association and try and show them that were actually concerned bc next year is an election year for a lot of alderman and we really need to have a community relations arm and we need to make sure we have the right officials in office
Ian: how are you going to make sure the old programs don’t suck
Steven: I have already prepared for that, and created outlines for step by step outlines to make sure that doesn’t happen. It should come together
Ian: and you have someone in mind to deal with that
Steven: yes David has agree because it is a service. And he is super competent
X: who will do the housing fair? 
Steven: if big bight night goes well, services ight, maybe we will still do it
Ani: if there are no objections we will move to a vote
(confirmed)
Up next PR
Becca: I have had a really good time being PR VP and I want to continue doing what were doing and making ASG a bigger name on campus and help students understand what we do for them
Henry: will you be sending out ASG weekly’s?
Ani: it has been sent out in every week
If there are no objections well move to a vote
(confirmed)
Up next Ethan
Ethan: hey im the VP of Tech! I am so excited that I actually get to do this again, we had one applicant including myself, a year ago, I applied and I had no idea of what I was getting into, I was in a play and I was really busy and I had had rehersals, and I figured, hey what the heck and sure enough I was up here, and I had no idea what ASG tech did or needed and now a year later, there is still so much more to come, like a new websight, so yeah that’s one of my projects, maybe redesigning book swap or MyNorthwestern, a new way of getting students together. There is no centralized location for Student Groups, before I just talk you up again yeah, Ethan Ramba
(confirmed)
Ani: David you have 30 seconds
David: yeah hopefully you guys have been able to see what I have done this year next year we look to maintain the new services we have launch and shift some of the resources I do have. We have the unique advantage of existing relations with city officials, otherwise we think we can really capitalize on that. 
(confirmed)
Ani: we have campaign promises
Victor: this has all the campus wide elected positions with a list f projects of what we promised and timelines. 
Ani: any questions?
Victor: we will be presenting after our exec retreat
Ian: you as an exec board member, what recourse would you like us to take if we are unhappy with your performance, i
Victor: email us, keep asking us questions, communication is the best way
Ani: you guys oversee everything exec does, barring all else, impeach them
April: will we be updated after the timeline?
Mark: there is a line about that, after they give their initial update, they will have to report again
Victor: I feel like that would just be more comprehensive exec board reports
(motion to previous question)
(passed)
Ani: NU gives back project pool requests which is new business
Lauren Saunders and Rebecca Rego: were both on the exec board, NU gives back is a campus wide day of service for students faculty staff and alumni, we will have fourty sights this year. This expands to all of NU’s campus, the idea is to unite as a campus and then to the broader community. We did apply for funding, for B status, and were denied. Although we are not technically an organization, we are well aware that uniting students is an objective of ASG and that is what were looking to do. In order to put on this event, we need an additional 1000 dollars. 
The money would be going to transportation, especially student groups on campus. 
Lauren: you are a student group with T status,
David: just like the SAF can go to food if senate approves it, this money is at your digression, it does come from the SAF, you can do what you want with it
Lauren: do you have a budget break down? Would it just be the school buses from last year?
Lauren: if you guys do give us this money, your logo would be on all of our merch, 
Ani: this is new business, well bring this back up next week. 
Ani: what were having now, is a general order in senate held for the most important pressing issues in our community. Were going to have a session led by Haley Stevens and explain how were going to go with this as we move
Haley: thank you for being here, we appreciate it. It is a very important conversation to have it, I am the chair of the ASG diversity committee in response to events that have happened and although there have been many events, this has been consistent with events from the past year. Suck as the black face incident of 2009, and then fast forward to this winter, when a Latina woman was mocked, there was a forum following that in January and a lot of groups began to ban together that wanted to see chang across campus. I am a member of the coalition of colors and we decided to hold a forum with the president and provost and we set up a lot for ourselves, there was a lot for students and administrators to accomplish. We formed a petition 1. An academic requirement, it is not new, it would be a cultural or social inequality requirement. It is very much in development. 2. The chief diversity officer, someone who people could go to if there was an issue on campus with all the resources. Ensure that everyone has a diversity plan 3. Multicultural student affairs- oversees over 3000 students and has about 40 dollars per student and it is not nearly enough and were looking to add LGBT resources. Were looking for MSA to have more resources. 4. Minority enrollment: were looking  for more help for Latina and Black ambassadors. 5. A re vamped diversity plan, and the already established diversity plan 6. The diversity report: created last year with the help of the admin and it assessed almost every aspect with hoe the school works with diversity. We would present it by april 30 and in return the admin would release the report. A few days ago, you can view the report in the provost’s office, but it was not public info. It is going to be made officially public, VP TI will talk about that in a moment, it will soon be made available online
Dr. Telles-Irvin: good evening, It is unfortunate that I have to see you on this evening dealing with a difficult situation that occurred this weekend and I am here to tell you about what the admin is already doing. The report is already up on the site, so that you have an opportunity to look it up. This report was one of many that was done in making strategy for the university. They were asked to put together a report that was going to be used for those who were creating the plan, no made for the public. You requested it and therefore it is made available to you. 
I am going to go through the requests that have been made of the university
The academic requirement
The provost  talked to everyone about how we can creatively deal with some kind of training around cultural competence, at the same time Weinberg has taken the lead, mary fin, 
We want it to be getting at changing behavior and changing atitutde, what is the most meaningful way to go about this subject matter? It is something that is going to take time
The faculty own the curriculum, we have to rely on the,
There is a curriculum committee made of faculty and students
That is happening but it is going to take time
Chief diversity officer, 
He has appointed Donna who has the title of Diversity Provost who will be working full time on diversity matters and will be reporting directly to the Provost and they will be the chief diversity officer. She will chair and oversee the diversity committee and hold the admin accountable as well as bringing in speakers
I plan on working very closely with her
Multicultural student affairs resources
There will be an analysis on the MSA budget
I have reorganized student affairs
I have brought together 5 areas for this new assistant VP, we may need to redistribute what MSA does to people who can do it more efficiently
We will then determine if they need more funding
Enrollment, 
At least for the coming year, the number of deposits has gone beyond what we exected, this means we expect underrepresented offers could be greater as well but we wont have these numbers in place till fall
Concrete goals and objectives that subcommittees that will be held accountable
The other two things I want to share is the police advisory board, I want to re create that, 
I have been in the process of asking individuals to apply, and I have almost completed appointing this board
The dean, and I have been working on a bias incident reponce portal, if an incident comes up there will be a way for us to know about it
We want a model where the students themselves can respond to incidences. 
I am here to make a difference and I can assure you that we are very committed to this issue and we need your cooperation and ideas. I hope that has answered some of your questions. Im hoping we can continue to work together in the future
Haley: so I want to continue to remind you all that this is a wonderful student and administrative victory and you all should be proud

We need to remember that this is only a small part of what we need to do, we all need to now engage eachother to properly have these conversations so it is an open honest campus 

Stand against racism starting at 1245 this Friday, all along ridge, we will be making a wall, a stand against racism, to meet at ridge, and from there we would like to march through the arch and up to tech and we would like through out the next few weeks to encourage all forms of conversations, we really want to encourage honest and open dialoged and for students to begin to feel comfortable
I would also like to remind you all, thatthis could have been anyone, or any organization campus and any of you could have been the target of this so please thing critically and thouroughly about the way you engage, lets truly make this one northwestern

Matt Dolf (pres of ski team): I have spoken to some of you in this room, first I would like to reiterate my apology to everyone in the NU community, what happened was obscene and cannot be stood for, we don’t endorse what we did and we hope to continue the conversation. I am here tonight speak, we have members of our exec board, we will continue to be here until our invitation is revokes, and we would like to move forward from this and use this as a lesson and use it as a tool to move forward from this situation. Thank you for letting us have a voice, we appreciate the opportunity, you didn’t have to do that. Thank you for the momentum and we would like to keep it going, things need to change for real .thank you. 
ANi: we are going to move into an open student forum, this is senate, the ultimate place of student expression, please keep your comment civil, were not looking for attacks and those will not be tolerated, and I will be enforcing that. We are looking for constructive tangible action. What you feel campus can do. I see leaders from across campus, a gathering I havnt seen in my time here. So keep that in mind
Kellen: we handed out a list of questions in anticipation of this, we figured we could help aid the conversation. 
Ani: were looking for dialogue, a back and forth. 
Kellen: in regards to the chief diversity officer, what qualifies donna cuerdero, and we ask this because we wonder what is the process 
Ani: this is a student to student conversation, PTI is not a part of this discussion. Dr. Teas Irvin is observing
Haley: the administration has told us how our questions have already been answered, there is a time and place for her to answer
Victor: she seems pretty great, obviously its tough bc the admin has been slow and it doesn’t make sense to shoot blank questions, there are 5working groups under the new committee and there has been change obviously the weels are slow to move but that’s where we come in so that we can develop a comprehensive platform, jazzy and haley were happy about it. 
Jazzy: I think we have a right to talk about it, this diversity report is saying a lot of the things we have been talking about. Why now?
X: I think if this is truly a student to student forum then we should hae kept the admin out of it
Ani: she is guest of the senate, pleae respect that going forward. 
X: we want a date for when these questions will be answered
Haley: I cannot say definatley, but I would like that to be next month, I want to be sure that we have every administrator that we want to be there to be there
Dallas: there is a lot of frustration in the room, and for me the whole interpersonal relationship thing doesn’t mean much, I don’t pay students, I pay the admin. I remain 6% of the populations, my tutition dollar funds parties like this, I am a customer, if I buy a car with three weels they don’t say be patient
Tyrus: using this forum to speak to the students I am disappointed in the attitude that people have taken w the administration when they are releasing info we have been asking for for a year. Just bc they are busy is not an excuse. We have to start demanding things and demanding things fast, can I ask for… give us a concrete answer, theyre schedules work around us, not the other way around. Were the faces of this university, that comes with a power. We tell you we want cultural classes, you can make it happen, use the power you have to get the results you want and stop sitting down on your ass. 
X: was the report supposed to be published and when did the students first ask for it? 
Haley: I am not positive, it was known that it had been in progress, we formally asked for it about 4 weeks ago, 
Paul: I sat up one night looking at old diversity reports and I think the last one was 2009, that was a faculty diversity report but it was just promoted. It was just withheld.
Haley: That looked ONLY at faculty, 
X:I would like people to ask why there havnt been more comprehensive ones. 
X: I think its great having students talking to other students, I think its silly to put up beaurocratic walls when the person is sitting in the same room and not be able to talk to them, I am really hapy the VP is here but I think its silly that we should have to wait to talk. I think we as students, that they claim to be here to help us learn and grow and the fact that the administrators couldn’t make it here with all these students have made it a priority to be here… 
Haley: what I mean by a future forum, is that a time when they are in town, they are rather far away right now
Catherine: smething really important in theater is to have trust in the leaders and directors, I think that if you don’t have that then the people in charge, cant do their best. I really appreciate you two taking all the complaints from the student body and you are just students and I appreciate your taking the initiative. (clapping)
X: I am very disappointed, this has been an attack on the admin, there were many opportunities to talk to the admin and nobody was there, there have been many opportunities and many people who are attacking the admin now were not there. 
Sophia: I think there are a few things to keep in mind both the questions that were asking, some are meant to be answered by the admin and some meant to be answered by us. Youre not coming up with ideas to face these challenges, 
Mark: the administration can be very helpful, the administration, Julie Kirshmeyer, is going to help us come up with a way to help CCS stay on campus, and we have been able to work with the administration and help us come up with an answer. 
Steven: attacking the admin and not, I think there is a bit of a false dichotomy and I think a lot of people attacking the admin spent last night talking with other students talking about giving pressure where pressure is necessary. There have to be students saying “we see what were doing” the ski team saw what they were doing and recognized that what they were doing was not okay. These converstaions are constructive. They are not anybody’s fault. 
X: how do we get the people who aren’t talking involved in the conversation. Were all the same people complaining
Alex: I agree with what youre saying I think there are plenty of opportunities that we don’t capitalize on. Were all involved, we need to identify was to coorperate in way to talk with eachother and engage and talk to eachother. Like the ISA world cup , or the Black Jewish Freedom Ceder. These are things that we can all be doing all the time. When we come together and talk like this, don’t go home reight away talk to people. 
X:I would like to respond to the prior comment, were listening and trying to learn, we want to hear what youre saying, and try to figure out how to help
X::how do you learn, or consider if youre not engaging with both sides, its not like you go into class and you sit? You have to engage with both sides
Mitoki: hi guys Im in a music frat, a few months ago we had big debate about a homosexuality, how do we learn? From here, I can probably only name like 3 african Americans I know, reach out to us. We have done some stuff with phi beta sigma, I would love to hang out with you guys but I don’t know how to reach out to you and you don’t know how to reach out to me. 
Dallas: that is the saddest shit I have ever heard, you can go about your daily life and not have to, we can love eachother and know eachother. There is not any actual physical diversity. 
X: we are offered up as a digestable part of your community, do you know how many white people I see a year?
Jazzy:what I am saying, what is being said is invalid, how many people are uncomfortable, we have to respect one another. If any one is uncomfortable and you don’t understand why you’re angry, on both sides. 
X: one of the things that we brought up, you look at the strategic plan of the campus, 3rd spaces, cant be the only way to engage in diversity. It implies that there are 2 other spaces that are not diverse. 
Diamond: what is going on right now is you have people that feel this tension of and those that are uncomfortable that they don’t understand this tension. How do you have these groups moving forward and relishing in their pain? Pepople who are upset and don’t understand why, and why they are making a big deal. Secondly, the people who are not understanding, we need to make them understanding, we need effort on everybody’s part. On the end of the day we can be exclusive. We need to make people understand that tension and move move forward frm that
Jean: I come from an extremely native American culture. There is nobody in this room who has stood up for them, the fact that they are not represented here says so much about this university. There is no conversation about it,  I am on the ski team and I dressed as a navijo. I didn’t realize and I apologize, 
Tori Griffin: I am here applying for a job, but what I want to say to you is that from an outside perspective, I can feel the emotion, and the white students really uncomfortable, and the black people really emotional and I think this guy (Mitoki) really offended some people and I think Dallas really got that there was more to be said about that. I want to challenge you guys to be okay with making mistakes and saying the wrong thing. 
X: I would like us to cut the crap and the person to the right and infront of you….
Haley: thank you tony that was an excellent idea. Next week is may 5th, I would like to remind you all that following cinco de mayo we don’t have to be back here, I cant tell you how conco de mayo insults me. Hopefully, we wont have to see students wearing sombreros next week
Jesus: where do we go from here? How many people know that may is asian American month. This Tuesday there is an event: why do all the asians sit together? Please read the diversity report
Tyyrus: I don’t like that you are going to talk over us, when I am talking about the speed with which the university can move. It took hours to increase the percentage of minority enrollment. I appreciate what Mitoki said, I know you. I apologize for disrespecting senate. Everyday we wait for more answers, we have people drawn to tears because of the experiences they have had. This is a place where I should be able to walk into any administartors offices and know that they will be able to fight for me. We need to continue to hold ourselves to a higher standard of excellence, and we need to love everyone else as we love ourselves. This is real, we are the people that will rule the world, everyone needs to take it personally when I feel uncomfortable. 
Ani: 80% of the incidences are student on student, what can we tell constituents for a plan of how to solve this. I would like to move into discussion on tangible soultions. 
X: we are all leaders and we need to mobilize our groups to spread these ideas. Have these discussions with people that you know. Bring up the topic and talk about it. 
Sam: I agree this needs to be a student on student involvment, since we entrust in this institution our edu, why cant we entrust in them cultural competency. When we self police, this doesn’t happen. You have seen what happens on wall street, it isnt going to happen on our level, it has to happen at the administrative level. That’s why we keep coming back to these forums
X: this is the only group on campus that we could get
Jazzy: to step aside, an idea to address what you just said, why not, turn Friday, into students going out to deering, and we get everyone to meet eachother and we talk about the conversation we had tonight and get the conversation like what we had tonight going. We need to do something like that immediately or else people will not keep this up. What if we got 8000 students out there on deering, 5-6
Ani: mayfest is having something next Friday called pack a picnic, 
Mikey: I want to say, to be honest there is a lot of anger in this room, and a lot of people don’t go through it because they don’t go through it, and I don’t know what its like to be you. If you’re not out there meeting me, then you are not being culturally competent, just because u know someone doesn’t mean you get to be racist, 
Elena: im from the wildcat welcome board, I just met jasmine, were setting up new training sessions for the Pas to set up and foster ways to get them to better handle. I also think that the topic of women hasn’t come up. 
Tony: everyone in here has something that I don’t have, I get to stand in front of you because Im not in a wheelchair. Cultural competency courses, I need to be having conversations. If all of you are counting on the way you’re being educated, youre all going to get fucked. 
Ian: motion to bring emergency legislation to call to order 
(seconded)
Kellen: I think the idea that Jazzy brought is great, I ask that the administration send out a email suggesting that  the university would like to do a culture wide course to think through these situations. The university itself should participate 
On the same email we should get some answers to the questions we have put forth. 
Ani: with that I would like to move to the legislation we have put forth
Victor: we are a 100 member organization that represents all of you and were gonna help you guys put up this fight, its not a one man battle, I think what is powerful about ASG is that it can have an impact. This is a statement from ASG and I encourage you to visit Dallas’ web sight. We have the petition we would like everyone to sign. ASG has to be there for all of us to sign. 
X: you should add the diversity report
X: motion to move to old business
Ian: motion to amend
Link to the diversity report
(passed)
Victor: first paragraph: these incidences need to move beyond a forum. Second paragraph, really understanding other backgrounds and really understanding where the stories come in… I guarantee you that between us and the diversity committee, we do everything in our power to make sure the administration moves forward on these proposals. 
Ani: this is the legislation that would trigger this motion forward and validate everything that has been said tonight. Does anyone have any questions?
Ian (motion to previous question)
Alex: this is just a statement?
Ani: were gonna vote on it
(passes)
with every senator in this room, you take home this action translated. And thank you, really quickly, were moving to improve NU’s curriculum. 
Ian: an ad hoc committee to identify areas of the curriculum that are lacking. Things that could be included in cultural competence, if were going to have a cultural competence requirement we need a curriculum to stand behind it. We need a group of people to get this done. 
David: I think you still have described things that out to be addressed by the academic committee, this is dublicating efforts
Ian: its not at all, I spoke about it with Neil, he wasnted to hear what senate had to think about it, these are not thins that neil had in his platform, I have already started this work, and its not fair to give the problem onto him and to a committee that is not capable to take these projects on. 
(good of the order)
(roll call)

Victor: we have the priorities list were in the process of making it more of a master plan so we can present it and tell students what were working on and can tell people. It should be done before the end of the year
How many people have signed up for NU gives back, I met a lot of great people last year we gave them 1000 so we should be supporting it
Ian: when do you expect to have the master plan done, 
Victor the end of the year
Ian: can you make it public
V: yeah sure
Brad: if you haven’t yet, you should be getting an email about the group you are assigned to and 
we are also in the process of talking about marketing. 
3 new pieces of legislation 
office hours
Alex: I put in the exec board writing report, I am on the 1 book one NU, they want senators leading groups of freshman into the city to tie in with the book. So if you’re interested, send me an e-mail, its September 30th. The book is called  Never a City so Real
Ani: alternates cant vote in funding
Becca: we have 2 flyers, off campus senator apps deadline is extended, all of you need to take some and hang them up somewhere
There are three spots open for flyering, 
Ani: were doing a quick publicity campaign to tell people what ASG does, and we have 8 new senator positions so keep in mind that senators have a one hour PR requirement, eve if you don’t have a slot please take some and hang them up in your dorm. 
Brandon: after senate I will send out a link for senator trainings, all new senators need to get trained, be on the look out for that. 
David: a few weeks ago during the power point I gave you a preview of what our projects will be
Taxi cab share smart phone app
Student lead seminars
Norris mini course but by a student, anything from excel training to personal passions. Everyone would potentially pay 5 dollars. 
Printers in dorms
Study abroad housing guide
Maintain current services: big bight night, legal services, etc. 
All members of my committee will compose an action brief
Girish: thanks for last week, there will be 4 open spots on the SAFC so if any of you are personally interested please talk to me or shoot me an email and please tell your constituents and you should talk to me before hand. 
The SAFC deals with a status groups and we disperse their funding (1.4 mil)
If you know someone who want to run!
Ethan: HEY EVERYBODY! Two quick things, has anyone heard of “Video” it’s a new video conferencing service that NUIT instituted, who uses skype?! For free on Video, you can video conference for free with up to 7 people. Check out that cool new service, you can just google its VYDIO
Next week I am meeting with the NUIT student advisory committee and we talk about what NUIT is up to and share news about tech on campus. 
ASG IT wish list, the idea is to get some ideas out on the table about what we would like to do on campus, what would be the ultimate in projects NUIT could take on to better campus. I am taking ideas
Mark: not enforcing piracy law
Partick: seconding what mark said
Ethan: anything that is slightly more legal
Krish: web development classes
Tori: better Caesar
Mary Grace: something easier to use
Becca: chrome
X: blackboard app on android
Mark: students download software available on public computers
Photo editing, adobe
X: the way videos are posted on blackboard
Ani: minutes are now available online, I sent the link out to you on my exec report, as well as the agenda,
Please send all announcements to asg-speaker@u.northwestern.edu. Please cc asg-parliamentarian when you are sending out announcements to constituents. Its is critical for accountability
Protocol: laptops are a privilege, not a right, if I see a lot of typing or grinning, I can ask you to put it away, you should only look at the funding packet or the agenda, please give speakers your undivided attention
The transportation working group has one position open for a senator, if these are issues that interest you please let me know
Ani: New Business, the diversity committee
Brad: this is the first of three pieces of legislation, what we are proposing is structure change to the way committees work to an extent, hopefully you are familiar with the diversity committee, it will move the structure to a committee from a commission and it will change the chair of the committee to an associate VP under the VP of student life. They will be chosen by a selection committee, with the student life VP, the coalition of colors, the former associate VP. That is a run don of the bill to formalize the structure and it is a way of making sure that it is not forgotten. This is just new business. 
Sustainability: this does the exact same thing except the committee doesn’t exist yet so we would be creating it. 
Working group on Alc policy and culture, this is a joint effort to evaluate alc policy specifically to do some peer institution research and really look at potential ways to make alc culture here more safe. It would consist of a working group made of some senators and some other students that would have to report back to senate. It would require some work over the summer but not totally. 
Mark: do you have any sort of long term goal they are working towards?
Brad: its not specified in the legislation but when we spoke to PTI she said she would support it. 
We also spoke to her about the Responsible Action Protocol
Victor: our agreed timeline was to create a timeline for the proposal so it made the most sense to do this, this way
Brad: if the bill passes next week we would have elections next week. If you’re interested please contact me beforehand so talk to me about it. 
Ani: the following senators cant vote because they weren’t here or they are new. 
The way funding works is we have a randomized list, we will go through a cut round, if you feel like based on the funding packet we have sent out, that the line items should be cut, you can motion and have it seconded and then we will debate and vote on it. After a cut round we will go through an add round and there is a 500$ amendment pool. In the add round we can motion to add that to specific line items if you feel that the SGC has not added sufficient funds. 
CUT
Students for life: cut the line item for bioethics symposium honorarium 
Jared: the policy right now, is confusing, the red cross club were denied 300 dollars for funding for an honorarium because it was a gift not a fee, but there are currently 3 honorariums being funded, none of them should be it doesn’t make sense when some of these groups get funded and some of them don’t. 
Lauren: the reason they didn’t get funded bc a NU Law professor was speaking and they speak for free, we typically fund honorarium. 
Ani we will now go into 3 rounds of pro and con
PRO: Jared: if an honorarium is a gift not a fee, isn’t an honorarium a gift? 
Lauren: honorarium is a person who comes to campus to speak. The difference is that it was a NU law professor that would come for free, we don’t want to spend money on something that isn’t a charge, this law professor shouldn’t be paid if he is willing to speak for free. 
Motion withdrawn 
ADD
Flipside: motion to add 50 dollars to printing costs
Ben: treasurer, we are NU version of the onion, we publish funny articles on line and every quarter we ask for funding for issues, we requested 400 dollars for printing, each one casts 100, this quarter we were given 150. We can print a half an issue, 
Lauren: the SGC doesn’t normally print publications, the committee feels that flipside’s printing, is like an event, they couldn’t get advertisements which is usually how revenue is made for publishing. They asked for 400 dollars to up the quality of paper which we didn’t think was pertinent, 
Mark: what kind of paper are you using?
Printing paper
Mary grace: what has advertising looked for you
Ben: we have new leadership and they are still in the process of transitioning, marketing hasn’t been a priority. We havnt had a committee in a few years so this upcoming year we are introducing that
PRO: ben: since it costs 100 dollars to print we wouldn’t be able to print a half
CON: Matt: Lauren explained the reasoning for funding, we would like to fund half the cost of publication. Also, the SGC doesn’t feel that an increase like this is sustainable for the future. We are happy to fund them at half but the extra 50 every quarter is not sustainable
PRO: the extra 50 wouldn’t be going towards higher quality paper, if we had gotten the 400 it would have but the extra 50 would just be for the printer paper
CON: Lauren, the SGC will continue to fund them at half, we want to ensure that they can have their publication go out. We fund programming and we want to make sure flipside achieves their goal so they can run their publication. It is not sustainable for us. That would be 600$ a year for them to run their publication. Flipside has been working really hard though, so I am not making a pro….. 
(motion to PQ)
All in favor of granting flipside an extra 50$
(passes)
Happiness Club: 20$ for Play-doh
Alex: I am the recruitment director for happiness club, we requested 20 for play doh. It was rejected for internal use, however next week there will be an event and we are going to make playing with play-doh. This will be a one time addition 
SGC cant fund internal invents, we fund programming that is opened to all campus, this is technically a different line item for play-doh before. 
Sarah: do you realistically believe you be able to re use the play doh?
Alex: Motoki 
Motoki: when is this event happening?
Alex: we did 2 different weeks this year and one in the fall.
Mark: what color play dohs are you purchasing?
Yellow, green, blue, maybe red?
Mark: I am concerned if you reuse these colors it will result in brown
(motion to PQ)
(passed)
Camp Kesem: motion to allocate 100 dollars to banner
Victor: i am the treasurer for camp kesem, it is a one time fee that we could use for any event we could use for fund raising, we are willing to cut out the 20 dollars for publicity, I recognize that publicity is standardized at 20 but this would be really valuable. 
Motoki: we do standardize publicity at 20 we have denied other groups that have asked for more money than that. The banner would be used at camp and we can fund something that is not open to all NU students, 
Eric: how does this benefit NU students?
Victor: were awesome we would use this for recruitment and for events, although it is a publicity thing
Eric: just because the standardize it at 20 would you be comfortable receiving less?
Lauren: the reason we have standardizations is so that everything is fair. Bu you guys voting yes for this you are opening the flood gates and although victor does need this all the groups could use more funding and that is not sustainable. 
Sarah: have you considered going to Artica and making your own? That is probably around 20. 
Victor: we wanted something more professional looking and we didn’t consider that viable
PRO: victor: I wont be devastated but any money would be awesome we put on a camp for kids that have parents going through or have gone through cancer, we would use the banner a lot for on campus publicity that would improve exposure. Our counselor increased by 50% this year and we are looking to expand
CON matt: so just to make it abundantly clear, were not saying that this is not a worthy cause, we are proud of what they do but we shouldn’t be judging and saying one group is better than another, we ask that we retain what we have standardized, if one group asks for 100 than all will and we don’t want groups thinking they are better than other. It is not a call senate is comfortable making and we hope senate will concur. 
(PQ)
(motion denied)
ISA: 
Iran: here to petition for 300$, I don’t know how many of you have heard of the internatonal food festival. Last year we got a NU night grant, and we partnered with A and O and they agreed to fund the whole event except for one movie, each movie right is 500. NU night grants are only for new events so we cant apply again. I know SGC has a very limited amount of money, ISA has an event every other week to bond the ISA community and to let other students come get to know us and the diversity we bring, we recognize that this event wasn’t very interactive so we want to have a night walk, we need funding for this to mark the past. It is not publicity. We estimate the cost would be 50 but we are asking for 30 and we are also asking to add 20$ for publicity
Lauren: they will need to motion for each line: 20 publicity, 30 for Night walk, and 250 for movie rights. The reason they are not on the board is because they submitted the app may 8th, and they were due April 20th. 
Ani: were not talking about specific money yet were just voting on considering their line items. 
Pathushia: are they still allowed to petition for money next quarter
Lauren: nothing will effect them later
Ani: any further questions?
Ian: why was the ISA app late? 
Iran: I overlooked it. 
Mark: have you approached RHA or RCB for other grants?
Iran: we did try to approach them but ISA has the world cup and they fund us a lot of money for that and so they have already funded ISA a lot of money. We did try, and they said, we can only do one event
(PQ to add ISA to the board)
(passed)
Iran: motion 250 for movie right for International Movie and Film festival, we have to buy at least one movie right to have this event, A and O will be funding the rest as long as we can get this one event
Lauren: normally we fund late groups 0. We recommend that the requests on the board be filled at half. Since the app is late it is coming out of the supplementary pool so if we fund them at full we would have to cut for groups that turned their forms in on time. 
Tori: would that include standardized publicity
Lauren: yes, the supplementary pool is so small
Alex: what else is going to draw from this pool?
Lauren: there is a group here that got their forms in on time that we are going to recommend in full but we can go through a cut round open to all groups
Katie: when you were making their speech they indicated that they were not asking for full funding, would you still have funded them in half if they had asked for more?
X: would you rather have one of those line items funded in full?
Iran: I think the event with A and O would be best to fund or else the whole event would go to waste. ISA doesn’t just do banners for publicity, we had a big banners and we asked everyone to write a note in their native language. 
PRO:
CON: Lauren, the situation here is that the SGC would not fund a late application because it is unfair to groups that don’t get their apps in and these groups were well aware of when the deadline is so it is very generous of the SGC to be considering this. We recommend 125 due to funding constraints. 
X: Motion to amend the line item to 125: I realize they are doing a good job and made a mistake, I think we should give them something but not half of the entire pool. 
PRO: the SGC is in favor of the amendment
(motion to PQ)
Ani: all in favor of accepting the amendment
(passed)
(motion to PQ)
(passed) 125 has been awarded
Iran: motion to 20 dollars for publicity: we need publicity really badly, 
Lauren: we recognize that they are a good group, and that this is trivial because it is 10 dollars. Every group needs a lot of things, the SGC is making a HUGE exception here because they were late. 
PRO:
Mark: Motion to amend: cut to 10 dollars
(Motion to PQ)
(passed)
(motion to PQ)
(passed)
Iran: motion for 30$ for night walk: after a really big event we will be able to find other sponsors, sometimes community building cant be done on a big scale, can we at least have 20 instead of 15 because 5 dollars makes a big difference
Lauren: we are recommending for 15 to keep it consistent. 
Michelle: how often do you do this? 
Iran: there will only be one
X: what is the tape for? It is tape and string, we want to make sure they don’t walk into the river. 
Brad: (motion to amend to 15) I would recommend that any group needs to raise a small amount of money they fundraise
(motion to PQ)
Ani we return to debate on the 15$
(passed)
Rotaracks: motion to add 2 line items, speakers, and publicity. 
It is the connection btwn college and roateree the international volunteer organization. Roateree. When we sent in the app we sent it out under the wrong format
Lauren: we submit apps electronically and in order to submit an app we ask they send it into a folder, they attached their app with their annual review form, on time, but in the wrong format. 
Ian: are you planning to avoid this in the future
Lauren: I don’t see this happening the problem that he turned his review doc in earl, the instructions are clear, I don’t see it as his fault but none of the other groups had this problem. 
PRO:
(motion to PQ)
(passed)
X: motion for 20$ for publicity
Lauren: we fully support both requests in full 
(PQ)
All in favor of adding 20$
(passed)
Motion to add 150$ to add a speaker. We had Gary Schultz come in as a volunteer. He talked about opportunities in volunteering and this year there will be a more prominent member
Alex: a member from the rotaree club is going to charge you to speak when there are not traveling expenses
X: this would give us a wider range of people to choose from
Lauren: we fully support this and would have funded this in the funding debate. 
(Motion to PQ)
(passes)
Ian: motion to open up an add round, please don’t shake your head at me
Girish: what happens to the pool if its not spent?
Lauren: it will be redistributed next quarter
 (motion denied)
Ani: motion to close funding- passed

Ani: Ians legislation was tabled two weeks ago, 
Ian: I would like to kill it forever
Mark: SECONDED!
Ani: all in favor please say Aye

Senate 5/2
Ani: were going to go ahead and get going with roll call…
In the interest of being environmentally friendly we are moving towards a projector based agenda, SGC confirmations. 
Lauren: the SGC did spring recruitment bc everyone moved to exec, we had a lot of apllicants and I selected 6 after speaking to my committee members, were confirming everyone who was not confirmed, if you could come up here to the front
If you guys don’t know what we do, the committee who works with the B status group these guys will be the ones responcible for recommending funds to the B and T status, these guys wil talk about their experience, these guys will make the recs for funding
Andrew
Ben Eisenberg
Neil
Motoki
Kate
Lauren
Paul Chu
Nick Degancy
Ani: were going to move into a brief question session, these are the people were entrusting to talk to over 200 groups
Ian: can I just ask about the selection process?
Lauren: an obsticle cource, I did some serious publicity, I reviewd their apps and then had interviews with my committee and some members helped, and that was good. The interviews were 20 min each. 
X: what are some of the problems with SGC and how are these people qualified to fix it
Nick: how to better foster relationships btwn groups, it is something we have been working on and will continue to work on
Paul: I have no previous experience, but I want to bring more effective communication
Lauren: exec board turnover, making sure old knowledge is passed down
Kate: wild cat connection, trouble with that, some of my friends missed the activities fairs I think wildcat connection is the biggest problem, I am tring to transform that site into a more interactive site. Interviews posted online, 
Motoki: I agree with what has been said, exec transition is a huge part of how groups disapeer, being able to apply the knowledge from groups we work with and show them how to effectively transition and to have groups collaborate, we have a lot of groups coming in with similar mission statements, 
Neil: people don’t know how to allocate funds and we need to teach them how to ask for what they need
Ben: I have been to one meeting so I cant tell you how problems but I am looking to form relationships rather than just being a number
Andrew:Use your resources to really get events out and to help these groups as much as we can
Ani: Any objections to moving to the vote? (confirmed)
Were gonna move back into exec board reports
David Chi: a really good service opportunity may 9th, epic academy a charter high school with 150 students coming in we have a partnership with them for the past 2 years. Essentially the kids come in we give them a tour from 10 to 11 and then they can either sit in on a class or eat lunch with a NU mentor and get a sense of college. There will be a student panel that I need about 10 students to come sit on and talk to these kids about what it means to be a student and why it is important. What the expectations are. I need volunteers, I understand Wednesdays are hard for you guys but im gonna send ani a link with times and expectation and so please look that over and consider making it an experience. 
Ani: this is something ASG does every year so we need help. 
Steven: tere are some student groups ehre, there is an even coming up right after dillo day reNUvation, a day where we quickly clean up the mess we all help make on dillo day, if there is anyone that has any connects with service groups, we would really appreciate co sponcering, if you do have connections, talk to your exec boards, but sometimes its better if youre giving them a nudge
Brandon: were gonna start the rules training tues at 8, this is required for all new senators, if you have an excuse please be sure to send me an email and let me know
ANi: we have some senators
Andrew: a freshman repping Bob, I don’t live there, SESPE econ, LOC
Sally: repping Alison, I don’t live there, freshman bio chem.. 
Ani: its really ahrd to fill these seats at then end of the year so we are trying to give these people some experience. 
Were going to move into intro to funding which oversees all A status
Girish: Finantial VP, funding just wrapped up last night, we deliberated for about 40 hours on that so now its up to you guys to vote on what we have done. The way it works, every student at NU pays into the activities fees each student pays 150 dollars a year, we get 95% of funding, there are 40 A status groups, the way we allocate is through a rigorous app process that includes all programming for the past year as well as all requests for the upcoming year. They need to request for specific items, we are bound by their requests, after those apps, they come in and interview, we had about 15 hours of interviews but they pretty much walk us through their apps and give us a ton of info that we use to come up with a recommendation, using that info we come up with recs for you guys for what each event deserves, what we look at is quality, attendance, our relationship with the group, their contact with Natalie, finantial misconduct, group misconduct, a reflection on bad communication, those recs were finished last night and Ani will send them out to you. If you guys want paper, we are going to print a few but we wont be giving them out to everyone, once you get these recs you have a week to go over them, I encourage you to talk to people you know in these groups, it is all contingent on your votes. 
Senate amendment pool 54,000
This is your money to allocate as you wish, the add round groups will come in and tell you why they think they need more than what they have been given. 
You don’t have to use all of this money. 
There is also subfunding and this pool has been growing, any money you don’t use will go to programming in the fall so don’t feel the need to spend it all
It is very much based on the tiers they have given
If an event has never been funded before we don’t fund it, we are very conservative, we want groups to show that they have been able to put it on by itself
Any group that is funded by us they need to have 3% in their account at all times
Capital improvements are funded in the subcycle in the fall, we don’t do that now, think about groups that are asking for iPads, think about if they need it
We do not fund food, that will come up next Wednesday
That was a quick rundown
We are goin got run through some scenarios, 
Ani: this is now new business, next Wednesday we will do this now we are going to do mock funding for NU Line dancing team which does not exist so here is a mock situation
Are there any motions to add?
Lauren: motion to add funding to line dancing jamboree, I would like to ad 30% increase, funded in full, heres how it happened, the line dancing jamboree was the most magical night at my time here, I met my current BF as did several other people and I think that that is most important. We had a 50% increase in our attendance. And we only got 6% increase in funding that doesn’t make sense! That’s why it should be funded in full
Ani a not from the board
TOri: we would love to increase this even more but 30% is not sustainable, we believe that a 6% increase is more than enough
Girish: increase this year was 4% on the pool, so, a little info based on what tori said, we have to be conservative, so we don’t outshoot the growth of the pool, most groups overtime have an increase on attendance so we have to be conservative. 
Ani: just to clarify there are cut and add rounds, senators… motions to add funding
Lauren: motion to add funding to the fall speaker? Okay I would like to fund the fall speaker event in full, let me tell you what happened we requested funds for this last year, we were denied, we made it wonderful without their money. 30 people came we brought a speaker, and they said to come once we did it by ourselves and we did and they only gave 150$ when we asked for 6000$
Tori: we funded the publicity and venu but this is a new event and to give such a large increase to a new event is not sustainable. 
Girish: groups come up with new events all the time and we would love for Lauren to come back to us next year and we would be able to give more. Normally you guys would vote on it but we just want you to understand basic scenarios
Lauren: I motion to add funds to the line dancing competition in full. This line dancing competition which takes place in texas with only the line dancing team. This is the time where we bond and show of NU to texas. It is what we train for all year and the fact that we cant get funding from NU for what matters most is obserd
TOri: as a board the SAF is funded by all students so events we fund must be accessible to events that are open to all group. 
Girish: we don’t fund groups, we fund programming so performance teams don’t receive funds from this body to attend competition. 
Lauren: usually its like “we want silverware for an internal event” we want to make sure all the programming SAF funds is open to everyone, consider who it is open to. 
Girish: any questions?
Ani: it is a very confusing process but this is our attempt to make sure everyone is on the same page
Girish: this is our attempt to make sure that funding doesn’t go on multiple day
Ani: the following week we will have B status funding. 
Ani:we will move to an update from Mark Silberg and the rest of the committee. This is for the legislation you passed on green Accredidation, they are an ad hoc committee and they are giving you their update. We require this of all of our working group, last week we had one from transportation and this is so you guys know what is going on and they would love to have feedback from you guys. 
Mark:my name is Mark Silberg, I made this slid show on my newly illegally downloaded version of Keynote, we broke up our task into 3 parts
Survey
Interest
Implementation
We finished surveying, on their current behavior, paper use, transportation. 
We had 30 groups respond across the board. 
On paper use: a large majority of students, more than half were flyering on the ground and in buildings. Most student groups don’t know what kind of paper they were using whether or not it is recycle content paper. We would like to address this
Chalking, we think that this is a way to avoid using paper products on the ground
We asked groups if they could eliminate paper use and be as effective
Transportation: while a lot of groups walk or bike, many groups use personal vehicles to travel around Evanston
Food and events: most student groups do not use red meat at their events 
Food wast: most groups don’t produce food waste. This is another issue we oculd address
Some groups don’t recycle on campus
Why do you choose not to buy locally: its more expensive
This is a common misconception
Is your group sustainable, how can you be sustainable
Many were open to being educated and didn’t know how to
Inconvencience price and not knowing, were reason for not being
We want to have a 2 step approach
Education 
Encouragement
Our hope is to educate groups and ultimately from our data, there are a wide veritey of events that are sustainable and not, find ways for asg to implement sustainability
Ani: Sophia and Lauuren do you want to talk about your work
Sophia: I noticed that whenever someone responded, they honestly did not have clear answers to our questions. These responcibilities were not delegated, it would benefit groups to have this delegated
Lauren: we split the work, a lot of groups are now having green chairs
Mark: we did a lot of work together splitting up the work and getting the survey out, they were awesome this is looking goof. 
Ani: this is what working groups do!
Steven: they do work!
Ani: they come back and report results and we move forward from there. Let me know if you are interested in working on one let me know, we will find something for you to do
The next order of business is Spring funding
Side note, don’t use cell phones or comps in front of you its rude
Steven: can we quickly move to new business, increasing election transparency
We decided this is important bc currently election guidelines only apply during spring quarter and it is very unclear about what is and is not allowed of what is and is not allowed leading up to elections. We want to make sure this is clear and codify it for all people in the future, next year the election committee will be made much sooner and people who are interested in running must meet with the committee and they have to explicitly say their purpose for these meeting. Just to shine light on this gray area and to make sure no potential candidates have a misunderstanding for what is or is not allowed and to ensure an equal playing field for all. 
Aaron: why don’t you justhave the election during the winter quarter
Steven: this isnt meant to extend the campaign period, but these meetings are necessary to prepare oneself and this is just to clarify and we don’t want any action to be perceived the wrong way
Aaron: if youre making the election commission winter quarter, wh not just start campaigning then?
Steven: the legislation will start that converstation, we don’t want people flyering and chalking. We just want public knowledge for student group leaders to reach out. I guess I can kind of roll this into the next one…
Ian: what would you do if a candidate over stepps the boundaries
Steven: I cant answer that, I don’t think people should be slammed so they cant run but I think there should be violations incase
Ani: the new guidelines which are going to stay till next year say that if there is a violation then it is referred to the rules committee. 
Steven: the purpose of this is to clarify what verbal campaigning means prior to the campaign. 
Steven: this bill, I have heard from a lot of people on this campus, there was an oversaturation of campaigning, so dormstorming is not allowed, candidates wont be allowed to do that any more. I don thtink this is perfect and I am open to friendly amendments, I think elections should occur as quickly as possible. 
Ian: it was university res life that said no dormstorming, it is now a university policy, that you are not allowed to do that
Brad: it has always been a policy that it wasn’t allowed and an acception was made for asg but that exception has now been revoked
Steven: this could be a little conversation but I want to get the conversation started the reason we all cosigned this is because what we heard from students is that the campaign went on for too long, that’s where I am coming from on this. I would encourage everyone to talk to students and what their feelings were about this. If we passed the previous bills, candidates identities will surface sooner, I just don’t think we should be spamming FB for too long. 
I view the two periods as being pretty distinct, you need a lot of publicity, but meeting with student group leaders is different, I see your point but that would be a pretty radical change. I am just trying to think about what would make students happy, I don’t think everyone would be happy about 3 month campaigns. 
Ani: this will be old business next week
Ian: are the two authors of the NUproject pool here? Motion to move up that legislation up now. 
Lauren: hi everyone I am treasurer of NU gives back we will give quick recap. It is a day of service in may and give back to the broader community, we are asking you for 1000 dollars for transportation to sights that are not otherwise accessible, we really want to make it a broad day of service, we are citizens of the chicagoland area. We need your help for that. We couldn’t ask for funding- we were not granted B status, we only have one day of programming and we are hopping to be exempt from the B status rules for funding bc this really is looking to give back. We would have a great sponcership, you will be on our banners shirts, and you will be recorded as our first sponcer
Patrick: we have the money available right?
Motoki: do you guys have a way to work around your budget, do you have a plan B? 
Lauren: yes, we have had other academic departments, but it will be difficult because it is in the next two weeks, 
Rebecca: this is a security thing. The bare minimum needs to happen 
Ani: factoring in the 5k initiative, and other project pool detractions, we have 1500 dollars. I urge you guys to do away with the notion that we have to save money, you are supposed to consider requests on a case by case bassis you don’t know if people will ask
Mark: I don’t want to spend it on transportation but I do want to help you. We cant fund those things, its not sustainable thing. Is there a durable thing we can sponcer?
Lauren: yes we do give everyone a T-shirt to emphasize the community. All of our sponcers are on the back of the shirts, the budget for that is 1500 dollars. 
X: right now where are you getting the money for the shirts
Lauren: we want our budget to be at 6000 to pay off everything, we are at 5000 now, that extra 1000 would be going for shirts. 
Mark: question to the parliamentary body, what is the accountability item?
Ani: we are requesting for a specific purpose so if we fund them it has to go to a specific line item. 
Patrick: it sounds like we have a specific stipulation the money should go to shirts. 
Lauren: yeah whatever you guys give us money to we will use. 
Ani: is there a second to the amendment? (seconded)
Girish: what are the three things that it goes to?
T-shirts
Food
Transportation
Girish: if you were to fund just 1000 for transportation, are you gonna spend the money no matter what? 
Rebecca: we are only going to spend 2000 on transportation only, it is the most condenced version of transport we can make. We are going to use no more than 6000 of funding. 
Patrick: it sounds like we are just covering our asses, changing the line item, 
Ani: cons? PQ? All in favor of passing the amendment for t shirts not transport
(passed)
Motoki: eventhough RHA is funding the same amount will we still be the first contribution?
Lauren: yes
ANi: before we move to PQ we call for debate, we should be going through 2 or 3 rounds of pro con for this bill
Abby: I think this is a really good opportunity for senate to get NU into the greater Chicago area, this involves so many groups and I think for ASG to have our name on that would help us. 
Ian: how many people attended last year and how many are you expecting
Rebecca: around 350 last year
Lauren: 450 is our minimum this year. 
Ani: motion to PQ? All in favor of passing?
(confirmed)
Ani:onto our next bill, improving the NU curriculum
Ian: basically, I will keep this brief, it does require some discussion, the point of this committee is to take projects and put it into another committee that will function differently. For these projects, they have been going on some time I am positive that these projects will take for a long time, maybe a year, to suggest that we can put them on the academic committee, is unrealistic. These projects already have passionate people behind them, it is good to keep them off to the side so Neil can focus on what he platformed. 
X: have these things been worked on by anyonen within the Academic committee, 
Ian: I am on the academic committee, but due to timing, these were not able to be worked on. The academic was mostly stagnant this winter
Abby: have you spoken to the administration about this? Would this committee be able to hold any weight?
Ian: there was a project last spring to get lab credit for lab sciences, that came to the admin from the academic committee. If you think the ASG doesn’t hold any weight…
Motoki: would you feel comfortable reportingn to Neil?
Ian: of course to meet with admin, it would have to be through the Academic committee?
X: why wouldn’t you just amend to refocus by the aademic committee?
Ian: these projects are outside from neils platform which we amended to uphold, the way I think neil is looking to take the committee, these people would drag down the committee, because they only have one focus. To really feel out what the body wants from other groups, their time would be too monopolized through projects. It’s a way to get more work done which needs more people. 
Ani: were going to move into a debate period, 
Really quickly we mentioned campaign promises it mandates that all the VPs are supposed to return from the exec retreat with a list of projects that will be reported to senate and then a new date will be set to report to senate again. Were gonna move into pro con about that. Next week the priorities are coming. 
Ian: all im proposing that we get more work done with people who have demonstrated an ability, 
Victor: I think this should be tabled, you don’t know what the projects are going to be for the academic committee, we can definitely incorporate a lot of these ideas, I don’t think it is appropriate to create a new committee. I think that mary grace brought up a good point, the committee has legitimacy, I don’t think we want to dilute that. 
Ed (con): I have a problem with the argument that the different committee has their hands ties by the campaign promises and I think that if we are going to set a precident in their campaign that they are not allowed to work on that
Franciis: If were just going to ignore legislation, why would we just ignore it. I agree these groups shouldn’t be stunted
Ed: if youre using that bill you’re manipulating it, 
Ian: what was said, I don’t think im manipulating the bill, but im down to table, rather than seeing this shot down because I think these projects are very important, as far as the cultural requirements, 
Mark: motion to suspend the rules, and ask neil a question. (passed)
Do you intend to include these things in your platform, ?
Neil: yeah I think a lot of them already were,
Motoki: motion to postpone for a week
Ian: if we consider that were tabling for a week to next week which is funding then funding, I respect that funding takes a long time which is unfortunate.
Tori: so would we be voting on this before funding, or after funding
Ani: after, the options you have before you. Postpone to a definite time or indefinitely. if its indefinitely, someone has to remember it and bring it back. 
Girish: I have already told everyone that funding starts at 730, 
Ani: you can choose 
Motoki: campaign promises is coming next week, if you don’t like how neil covers it than we can reconsider it. I don’t care if your tired from fonding, youre senators
Ian: (con) I would only accept postpone for a week if its actually a week, if its pushed back more than that it is unacceptable. More than a week would be too long to start work on this
Victor: I think this should be postponed till fall quarter, we should give Neil a chance to have a powerful committee, especially bc senate has the power to amend his platform to include all of these projects. 
David: point of info: with the acception of those obstaing, what was said is unanimous among exec. 
Mark: nobody is arguing against eachother, if we sense that theis is not a priority that these committees have then there may be a need for another committee but I also don’t think at this point of time we can decide this. I don’t want to rashly put it off until the fall
X: how many meetings do we have? 
Ani: There is one more that is not funding on the 23. 
Victor: I think is should be postponed indefinitely, 
Girish: funding on the 16th will not take that long. 
Ani: Any other pro speeches: were going to move to a vote, 
(division)
David: “There is so much drama! This one’s a close one!”
16 to 15 vote
David: “That’s epic!!!”
Victor: “How awesome is that?”
Rejected motion to postpone bill by a week
Motoki motions to postpone for two weeks
David: “Are you for real?”
There is a second
X: “When you postpone something indefinitely, can you bring it up any time?”
Mark: “Ooh, let’s do that.”
Ani: all in favor of postponing to two weeks?
(passed)
Ani: how did you guys feel about the forum last week?
Jane: I thought is was good but it was frustrating to have interupritons, I think there was 
X: I think it was really irresponcible for PTI to come and not speak
Tori: I think it was very unproductive, and there was a lot of emotion. If were going to do something like that again it needs structure
Ian: as far as PTI, she was insistant that she be here, she was not supposed to be in senate at all, the fact that she stayed was troubling
Brad: the process for PTI was that her and other admin were invited to come and not speek, admin were supposed to be able to observe. When we met with her earlier, she said, she was only coming if she could present her case. That decision was questionable in hindsight. 
Francis: I thought it was a good idea to have a forum because this is where students should be able to do that. But when the object of tension was here, she should have left. If it was supposed to be between studets then it should really be amongst students
I think there needs to be more structure like then Tyrrus interrupted and you asked him to stop he just kept going. 
Dana: I found it personally really frustrating, after the discussion, once we got down to business once we tried to pass legislation, the room cleared. It was disheartening
Prathusha: I wasn’t here but I heard really strong members from various groups that was here. Our goal is to brisdge the gap, they had a chance to come to senate and speak their mind. The community saw that ASG was trying to take action and hear people out, people felt it was the tright thing to do and I think we should promot that in furture senate
Mark: I want to return to PTI, if we invite students and admin, those students need to respect these rules and your rules and the degree of respect was very low. I think the exec and parliamentary student body need to figure out how to not have that structure
Neil: I think feature events should have structure, but Wednesday was good, people were able to get their anger out and from that we have had a few really good events like on Friday at deering. I think while that event was very uncomfortable at times, what has come from that has been great
Lauren: I have heard the senate thing, we shouldn’t be hard on ourselves, all the admin and profs took note of that and they bring up tis event when taking part of this issue. It was the start of like neil said things blossoming from it. 
Ani: any last comments then good of the order
I was sitting at the event and the person sitting next to me said that she appreciated it was a neutral space and that is really important to some people and I want to thank you guys for listening and being good hosts, being able to come here made it clear that it was important to them
Ian: (applause for Ani)
David: real quick I want to say two things 
Four new service committee Derrick Cox, Larry, there are 4 new service members. Oh Krish, really excited to have them join the committee
Second thank you so much, there were no senators not on services that came, which was frustrating. We had great contibutions from 20 people but I really wish you guys had joined in that because I fee llike I say every week something about owning your position. 
Ian: would you be open to having another brainstorm?
David: to be honest, I feel like we are more focused on working the ideas we have already. 
Brad: to build off what david was saying on ideas, a few of us have office hours, if you have ideas, please come to those before the retreat, please do come and take advantage of that.
	•	Victor: If you cant make it to those please send me and brad ideas. The more ideas we have going into the retreat. 
Senate 5/2
Ani: were going to go ahead and get going with roll call…
In the interest of being environmentally friendly we are moving towards a projector based agenda, SGC confirmations. 
Lauren: the SGC did spring recruitment bc everyone moved to exec, we had a lot of apllicants and I selected 6 after speaking to my committee members, were confirming everyone who was not confirmed, if you could come up here to the front
If you guys don’t know what we do, the committee who works with the B status group these guys will be the ones responcible for recommending funds to the B and T status, these guys wil talk about their experience, these guys will make the recs for funding
Andrew
Ben Eisenberg
Neil
Motoki
Kate
Lauren
Paul Chu
Nick Degancy
Ani: were going to move into a brief question session, these are the people were entrusting to talk to over 200 groups
Ian: can I just ask about the selection process?
Lauren: an obsticle cource, I did some serious publicity, I reviewd their apps and then had interviews with my committee and some members helped, and that was good. The interviews were 20 min each. 
X: what are some of the problems with SGC and how are these people qualified to fix it
Nick: how to better foster relationships btwn groups, it is something we have been working on and will continue to work on
Paul: I have no previous experience, but I want to bring more effective communication
Lauren: exec board turnover, making sure old knowledge is passed down
Kate: wild cat connection, trouble with that, some of my friends missed the activities fairs I think wildcat connection is the biggest problem, I am tring to transform that site into a more interactive site. Interviews posted online, 
Motoki: I agree with what has been said, exec transition is a huge part of how groups disapeer, being able to apply the knowledge from groups we work with and show them how to effectively transition and to have groups collaborate, we have a lot of groups coming in with similar mission statements, 
Neil: people don’t know how to allocate funds and we need to teach them how to ask for what they need
Ben: I have been to one meeting so I cant tell you how problems but I am looking to form relationships rather than just being a number
Andrew:Use your resources to really get events out and to help these groups as much as we can
Ani: Any objections to moving to the vote? (confirmed)
Were gonna move back into exec board reports
David Chi: a really good service opportunity may 9th, epic academy a charter high school with 150 students coming in we have a partnership with them for the past 2 years. Essentially the kids come in we give them a tour from 10 to 11 and then they can either sit in on a class or eat lunch with a NU mentor and get a sense of college. There will be a student panel that I need about 10 students to come sit on and talk to these kids about what it means to be a student and why it is important. What the expectations are. I need volunteers, I understand Wednesdays are hard for you guys but im gonna send ani a link with times and expectation and so please look that over and consider making it an experience. 
Ani: this is something ASG does every year so we need help. 
Steven: tere are some student groups ehre, there is an even coming up right after dillo day reNUvation, a day where we quickly clean up the mess we all help make on dillo day, if there is anyone that has any connects with service groups, we would really appreciate co sponcering, if you do have connections, talk to your exec boards, but sometimes its better if youre giving them a nudge
Brandon: were gonna start the rules training tues at 8, this is required for all new senators, if you have an excuse please be sure to send me an email and let me know
ANi: we have some senators
Andrew: a freshman repping Bob, I don’t live there, SESPE econ, LOC
Sally: repping Alison, I don’t live there, freshman bio chem.. 
Ani: its really ahrd to fill these seats at then end of the year so we are trying to give these people some experience. 
Were going to move into intro to funding which oversees all A status
Girish: Finantial VP, funding just wrapped up last night, we deliberated for about 40 hours on that so now its up to you guys to vote on what we have done. The way it works, every student at NU pays into the activities fees each student pays 150 dollars a year, we get 95% of funding, there are 40 A status groups, the way we allocate is through a rigorous app process that includes all programming for the past year as well as all requests for the upcoming year. They need to request for specific items, we are bound by their requests, after those apps, they come in and interview, we had about 15 hours of interviews but they pretty much walk us through their apps and give us a ton of info that we use to come up with a recommendation, using that info we come up with recs for you guys for what each event deserves, what we look at is quality, attendance, our relationship with the group, their contact with Natalie, finantial misconduct, group misconduct, a reflection on bad communication, those recs were finished last night and Ani will send them out to you. If you guys want paper, we are going to print a few but we wont be giving them out to everyone, once you get these recs you have a week to go over them, I encourage you to talk to people you know in these groups, it is all contingent on your votes. 
Senate amendment pool 54,000
This is your money to allocate as you wish, the add round groups will come in and tell you why they think they need more than what they have been given.

We do not fund food, that will come up next Wednesday
That was a quick rundown
We are goin got run through some scenarios, 
Ani: this is now new business, next Wednesday we will do this now we are going to do mock funding for NU Line dancing team which does not exist so here is a mock situation

Tori: we funded the publicity and venu but this is a new event and to give such a large increase to a new event is not sustainable. 
Girish: groups come up with new events all the time and we would love for Lauren to come back to us next year and we would be able to give more. Normally you guys would vote on it but we just want you to understand basic scenarios
Lauren: I motion to add funds to the line dancing competition in full. This line dancing competition which takes place in texas with only the line dancing team. This is the time where we bond and show of NU to texas. It is what we train for all year and the fact that we cant get funding from NU for what matters most is obserd

Girish: we don’t fund groups, we fund programming so performance teams don’t receive funds from this body to attend competition. 
Lauren: usually its like “we want silverware for an internal event” we want to make sure all the programming SAF funds is open to everyone, consider who it is open to.

Food wast: most groups don’t produce food waste. This is another issue we oculd address
Some groups don’t recycle on campus
Why do you choose not to buy locally: its more expensive
This is a common misconception
Is your group sustainable, how can you be sustainable
Many were open to being educated and didn’t know how to
Inconvencience price and not knowing, were reason for not being
We want to have a 2 step approach
Education 
Encouragement
Our hope is to educate groups and ultimately from our data, there are a wide veritey of events that are sustainable and not, find ways for asg to implement sustainability
Ani: Sophia and Lauuren do you want to talk about your work
Sophia: I noticed that whenever someone responded, they honestly did not have clear answers to our questions. These responcibilities were not delegated, it would benefit groups to have this delegated
Lauren: we split the work, a lot of groups are now having green chairs
Mark: we did a lot of work together splitting up the work and getting the survey out, they were awesome this is looking goof. 
Ani: this is what working groups do!
Steven: they do work!
Ani: they come back and report results and we move forward from there. Let me know if you are interested in working on one let me know, we will find something for you to do
The next order of business is Spring funding
Side note, don’t use cell phones or comps in front of you its rude
Steven: can we quickly move to new business, increasing election transparency
We decided this is important bc currently election guidelines only apply during spring quarter and it is very unclear about what is and is not allowed of what is and is not allowed leading up to elections. We want to make sure this is clear and codify it for all people in the future, next year the election committee will be made much sooner and people who are interested in running must meet with the committee and they have to explicitly say their purpose for these meeting. Just to shine light on this gray area and to make sure no potential candidates have a misunderstanding for what is or is not allowed and to ensure an equal playing field for all. 
Aaron: why don’t you justhave the election during the winter quarter
Steven: this isnt meant to extend the campaign period, but these meetings are necessary to prepare oneself and this is just to clarify and we don’t want any action to be perceived the wrong way
Aaron: if youre making the election commission winter quarter, wh not just start campaigning then?
Steven: the legislation will start that converstation, we don’t want people flyering and chalking. We just want public knowledge for student group leaders to reach out. I guess I can kind of roll this into the next one…
Ian: what would you do if a candidate over stepps the boundaries
Steven: I cant answer that, I don’t think people should be slammed so they cant run but I think there should be violations incase
Ani: the new guidelines which are going to stay till next year say that if there is a violation then it is referred to the rules committee. 
Steven: the purpose of this is to clarify what verbal campaigning means prior to the campaign. 
Steven: this bill, I have heard from a lot of people on this campus, there was an oversaturation of campaigning, so dormstorming is not allowed, candidates wont be allowed to do that any more. I don thtink this is perfect and I am open to friendly amendments, I think elections should occur as quickly as possible. 
Ian: it was university res life that said no dormstorming, it is now a university policy, that you are not allowed to do that
Brad: it has always been a policy that it wasn’t allowed and an acception was made for asg but that exception has now been revoked
Steven: this could be a little conversation but I want to get the conversation started the reason we all cosigned this is because what we heard from students is that the campaign went on for too long, that’s where I am coming from on this. I would encourage everyone to talk to students and what their feelings were about this. If we passed the previous bills, candidates identities will surface sooner, I just don’t think we should be spamming FB for too long. 
I view the two periods as being pretty distinct, you need a lot of publicity, but meeting with student group leaders is different, I see your point but that would be a pretty radical change. I am just trying to think about what would make students happy, I don’t think everyone would be happy about 3 month campaigns. 
Ani: this will be old business next week
Ian: are the two authors of the NUproject pool here? Motion to move up that legislation up now. 
Lauren: hi everyone I am treasurer of NU gives back we will give quick recap. It is a day of service in may and give back to the broader community, we are asking you for 1000 dollars for transportation to sights that are not otherwise accessible, we really want to make it a broad day of service, we are citizens of the chicagoland area. We need your help for that. We couldn’t ask for funding- we were not granted B status, we only have one day of programming and we are hopping to be exempt from the B status rules for funding bc this really is looking to give back. We would have a great sponcership, you will be on our banners shirts, and you will be recorded as our first sponcer
Patrick: we have the money available right?
Motoki: do you guys have a way to work around your budget, do you have a plan B? 
Lauren: yes, we have had other academic departments, but it will be difficult because it is in the next two weeks, 
Rebecca: this is a security thing. The bare minimum needs to happen 
Ani: factoring in the 5k initiative, and other project pool detractions, we have 1500 dollars. I urge you guys to do away with the notion that we have to save money, you are supposed to consider requests on a case by case bassis you don’t know if people will ask
Mark: I don’t want to spend it on transportation but I do want to help you. We cant fund those things, its not sustainable thing. Is there a durable thing we can sponcer?
Lauren: yes we do give everyone a T-shirt to emphasize the community. All of our sponcers are on the back of the shirts, the budget for that is 1500 dollars. 
X: right now where are you getting the money for the shirts
Lauren: we want our budget to be at 6000 to pay off everything, we are at 5000 now, that extra 1000 would be going for shirts. 
Mark: question to the parliamentary body, what is the accountability item?
Ani: we are requesting for a specific purpose so if we fund them it has to go to a specific line item. 
Patrick: it sounds like we have a specific stipulation the money should go to shirts. 
Lauren: yeah whatever you guys give us money to we will use. 
Ani: is there a second to the amendment? (seconded)
Girish: what are the three things that it goes to?
T-shirts
Food
Transportation
Girish: if you were to fund just 1000 for transportation, are you gonna spend the money no matter what? 
Rebecca: we are only going to spend 2000 on transportation only, it is the most condenced version of transport we can make. We are going to use no more than 6000 of funding. 
Patrick: it sounds like we are just covering our asses, changing the line item, 
Ani: cons? PQ? All in favor of passing the amendment for t shirts not transport
(passed)
Motoki: eventhough RHA is funding the same amount will we still be the first contribution?
Lauren: yes
ANi: before we move to PQ we call for debate, we should be going through 2 or 3 rounds of pro con for this bill
Abby: I think this is a really good opportunity for senate to get NU into the greater Chicago area, this involves so many groups and I think for ASG to have our name on that would help us. 
Ian: how many people attended last year and how many are you expecting
Rebecca: around 350 last year
Lauren: 450 is our minimum this year. 
Ani: motion to PQ? All in favor of passing?
(confirmed)
Ani:onto our next bill, improving the NU curriculum
Ian: basically, I will keep this brief, it does require some discussion, the point of this committee is to take projects and put it into another committee that will function differently. For these projects, they have been going on some time I am positive that these projects will take for a long time, maybe a year, to suggest that we can put them on the academic committee, is unrealistic. These projects already have passionate people behind them, it is good to keep them off to the side so Neil can focus on what he platformed. 
X: have these things been worked on by anyonen within the Academic committee, 
Ian: I am on the academic committee, but due to timing, these were not able to be worked on. The academic was mostly stagnant this winter
Abby: have you spoken to the administration about this? Would this committee be able to hold any weight?
Ian: there was a project last spring to get lab credit for lab sciences, that came to the admin from the academic committee. If you think the ASG doesn’t hold any weight…
Motoki: would you feel comfortable reportingn to Neil?
Ian: of course to meet with admin, it would have to be through the Academic committee?
X: why wouldn’t you just amend to refocus by the aademic committee?
Ian: these projects are outside from neils platform which we amended to uphold, the way I think neil is looking to take the committee, these people would drag down the committee, because they only have one focus. To really feel out what the body wants from other groups, their time would be too monopolized through projects. It’s a way to get more work done which needs more people. 
Ani: were going to move into a debate period, 
Really quickly we mentioned campaign promises it mandates that all the VPs are supposed to return from the exec retreat with a list of projects that will be reported to senate and then a new date will be set to report to senate again. Were gonna move into pro con about that. Next week the priorities are coming. 
Ian: all im proposing that we get more work done with people who have demonstrated an ability, 
Victor: I think this should be tabled, you don’t know what the projects are going to be for the academic committee, we can definitely incorporate a lot of these ideas, I don’t think it is appropriate to create a new committee. I think that mary grace brought up a good point, the committee has legitimacy, I don’t think we want to dilute that. 
Ed (con): I have a problem with the argument that the different committee has their hands ties by the campaign promises and I think that if we are going to set a precident in their campaign that they are not allowed to work on that
Franciis: If were just going to ignore legislation, why would we just ignore it. I agree these groups shouldn’t be stunted
Ed: if youre using that bill you’re manipulating it, 
Ian: what was said, I don’t think im manipulating the bill, but im down to table, rather than seeing this shot down because I think these projects are very important, as far as the cultural requirements, 
Mark: motion to suspend the rules, and ask neil a question. (passed)
Do you intend to include these things in your platform, ?
Neil: yeah I think a lot of them already were,
Motoki: motion to postpone for a week
Ian: if we consider that were tabling for a week to next week which is funding then funding, I respect that funding takes a long time which is unfortunate.
Tori: so would we be voting on this before funding, or after funding
Ani: after, the options you have before you. Postpone to a definite time or indefinitely. if its indefinitely, someone has to remember it and bring it back. 
Girish: I have already told everyone that funding starts at 730, 
Ani: you can choose 
Motoki: campaign promises is coming next week, if you don’t like how neil covers it than we can reconsider it. I don’t care if your tired from fonding, youre senators
Ian: (con) I would only accept postpone for a week if its actually a week, if its pushed back more than that it is unacceptable. More than a week would be too long to start work on this
Victor: I think this should be postponed till fall quarter, we should give Neil a chance to have a powerful committee, especially bc senate has the power to amend his platform to include all of these projects. 
David: point of info: with the acception of those obstaing, what was said is unanimous among exec. 
Mark: nobody is arguing against eachother, if we sense that theis is not a priority that these committees have then there may be a need for another committee but I also don’t think at this point of time we can decide this. I don’t want to rashly put it off until the fall
X: how many meetings do we have? 
Ani: There is one more that is not funding on the 23. 
Victor: I think is should be postponed indefinitely, 
Girish: funding on the 16th will not take that long. 
Ani: Any other pro speeches: were going to move to a vote, 
(division)
David: “There is so much drama! This one’s a close one!”
16 to 15 vote
David: “That’s epic!!!”
Victor: “How awesome is that?”
Rejected motion to postpone bill by a week
Motoki motions to postpone for two weeks
David: “Are you for real?”
There is a second
X: “When you postpone something indefinitely, can you bring it up any time?”
Mark: “Ooh, let’s do that.”
Ani: all in favor of postponing to two weeks?
(passed)
Ani: how did you guys feel about the forum last week?
Jane: I thought is was good but it was frustrating to have interupritons, I think there was 
X: I think it was really irresponcible for PTI to come and not speak
Tori: I think it was very unproductive, and there was a lot of emotion. If were going to do something like that again it needs structure
Ian: as far as PTI, she was insistant that she be here, she was not supposed to be in senate at all, the fact that she stayed was troubling
Brad: the process for PTI was that her and other admin were invited to come and not speek, admin were supposed to be able to observe. When we met with her earlier, she said, she was only coming if she could present her case. That decision was questionable in hindsight. 
Francis: I thought it was a good idea to have a forum because this is where students should be able to do that. But when the object of tension was here, she should have left. If it was supposed to be between studets then it should really be amongst students
I think there needs to be more structure like then Tyrrus interrupted and you asked him to stop he just kept going. 
Dana: I found it personally really frustrating, after the discussion, once we got down to business once we tried to pass legislation, the room cleared. It was disheartening
Prathusha: I wasn’t here but I heard really strong members from various groups that was here. Our goal is to brisdge the gap, they had a chance to come to senate and speak their mind. The community saw that ASG was trying to take action and hear people out, people felt it was the tright thing to do and I think we should promot that in furture senate
Mark: I want to return to PTI, if we invite students and admin, those students need to respect these rules and your rules and the degree of respect was very low. I think the exec and parliamentary student body need to figure out how to not have that structure
Neil: I think feature events should have structure, but Wednesday was good, people were able to get their anger out and from that we have had a few really good events like on Friday at deering. I think while that event was very uncomfortable at times, what has come from that has been great
Lauren: I have heard the senate thing, we shouldn’t be hard on ourselves, all the admin and profs took note of that and they bring up tis event when taking part of this issue. It was the start of like neil said things blossoming from it. 
Ani: any last comments then good of the order
I was sitting at the event and the person sitting next to me said that she appreciated it was a neutral space and that is really important to some people and I want to thank you guys for listening and being good hosts, being able to come here made it clear that it was important to them
Ian: (applause for Ani)
David: real quick I want to say two things 
Four new service committee Derrick Cox, Larry, there are 4 new service members. Oh Krish, really excited to have them join the committee
Second thank you so much, there were no senators not on services that came, which was frustrating. We had great contibutions from 20 people but I really wish you guys had joined in that because I fee llike I say every week something about owning your position. 
Ian: would you be open to having another brainstorm?
David: to be honest, I feel like we are more focused on working the ideas we have already. 
Brad: to build off what david was saying on ideas, a few of us have office hours, if you have ideas, please come to those before the retreat, please do come and take advantage of that.
	•	Victor: If you cant make it to those please send me and brad ideas. The more ideas we have going into the retreat. 
David: I have mine and then Neil has PA class so I have to share for him too
First, ASG services is winding the year down, what we did was write project breifs so we can get going in the fall I have been pretty sick but I ma proud of the work they put in
Jobcat: in the past week as a reference point, we have 10 new posts, and we have twice that many messages flowing back and forth with residents, so if you put up a post you are likely to get 2 messages in response, it is gaining traction and the momentum is building and we are really excited about that
If you are looking for a summer job there are so many available working for a restaurant
Steven: please go sign up for reNUvation I know post dillo day is a lot to ask but it is a short clean up event for the sake of improving our community relations and so evanstonians know that we don’t want to leave trash all over the fill, its no huge event or long term thing, just show up for an hour pick up some trash and then sleep for the rest of the day. 
There will be food and every little bit helps, last year it was about 30ish people and it took about an hour, this year we are over 30 already
Motoki: if you cant make it during the 30 min span..
Steven: if you can make it at all.. show up, 30 min is better than no minutes. 
Noah: does that count as community service, should I send it to the community service chair
David: announcements for neil, faculty and administrative honor roll, you all should have received an email, voting closes frieday its on tues from 5:30 to 7, let honor those that taught us best
Student faculty interaction budget: up to 300 dollars per event, intellectually stimulating, faculty that want funding must fil out a form, it’s a pretty neat program to inspire intellectual discourse 
Working on accounting classes, improving CTechs, that we came up on the exec retreat, working out to appropriate admin, if you want to get involved please let me know. He will send out another full list
Dillo day: get stoked, eat at the food trucks. Say hi if you see me in the golf cart but don’t ask for a ride
Victor: the priorities you saw that is being turned into a document
David: the newest American everyone!
Brad: off campus senator apps are due tonight at midnight, if you are a senator and you are re applying do that by midnight, 
you should have gotten an e-mail, there is a forum on alc policy and culture tomorrow from 530 to 7 at harris, if you want to come you need to RSVP, please email you should all come and if the legislation passes today about the working group, 
Ethan: HEY EVERYBODY: I have my notebook so you know ist serious
The ASG IT Student advisory committee: its me alex and victor. We talk about tech. 5 quick things
Wi-fi, there are some new installations with the student affairs renovations, Allison, some green spaces, over the summer
5k improvements, those will be put in place this summer, the police are subsidizing it because they are inserting security on the lakefill
NUTV, was actually kind of up for grabs, not sure if we wanted to continue it. A lot of people use it, and they value it, so that’s continuing into next year
There are a lot of new PCs being upgrated in the tech basement, they are being put in
New macs in the library basement
Blackboard is being upgraded, OH MY GOSH, its actually not that big of a deal, you might not be able to tell the difference,
There is a rubrick feature so profs can communicate assignments more clearly
Mobile learn: accessing blackboard via android last sente, they are working on it, mobile learn integrates with blackboard, via ios android and everything else, also wifi and cellular networks. 
Ani: as brad mentioned, off campus senators, apply, shoot me an email, it’s a very cool spot, its kind of a bad ass caucus, just putting that out there, 
Not of transparency, minutes and agendas are both online, forward those to your friends
Thanks for stopping by my office hours
I ask that you shut you laptops during our gues speakers so you can give them their full undivided attention
Donna cuartero is here to talk to us about her newly created diversity position
Dona cuartero: thank you very much for inviting me. I have a disclaimer, those of you who know me, you know this, I have a fan if I start using it it has everything to do with age
What were doing at the university to deal with diversity as we move forward
The provhost, the position I have was created in the april, before that I was the assistant prohvost for faculty development, underrepresented faculty
I was a resource for tenured line faculty
I also did a lot of connecting people to one another
The provhost asked if I could work for diversity and inclusion, not I work with students staff and alum, we thought it was important because prior to this we had a lot of diversity initiative but they were all pretty disperate isolated efforts, we thought we needed a more centralized effort, we can find out if there are any redundancies, something that would have a broader look
We have put in place a university diversity counsil, the counsil now includes reps from the student body faculty staff and alum, we have 5 working groups focusing on distinct areas
Faculty recruitment: taking the place of the faculty diversity committee, more recruitment for underrepresented, 
Academic requirement: there is a group that is working with Weinberg admin, a group of students and faculty who have been looking at this through Weinberg
Mary finn has been the coordinator, this group will look more strategically across the university
This will take a while, the provhost stated that its not easy to make academic changes across the board like that
We will have reps from the school of music, medill, etc. 
Campus life: focus on inclusion efforts across the university whats the environment like? We want to make sure that everyone feels welcome and can learn and grow
Pipe line: bringing more underrepresented undergrad to NU and preparing them for graduate study. 
Out reach, exposing kids at younger ages to college and to nu, increasing the pipeline at all different levels
Lifetime Connections: reps from all the affinity alumni groups, the black, Latina, muslim, LGBT, alum associations, there are a number of reps as well as staff and students, and every group has under grad and grad as well as faculty and staff reprisentatives
Our first meeting will be june 4th, at that meeting we will identify the specific goals and objectives so the groups can get started, 
The first meetings were to get to know eachother and expectations
The provhost asked for all of the deans to submit to him initiatives from 02-12 involving diversity
We want to
Look at whats in place
Whats no longer in existence
Effectiveness
Expansion
Build more collaboration across schools
Were using this document as a base line
What are the needs
What do we have in place
What are the gaps
That’s the infrastructure we have put in place
There was a forum we had on Saturday that I participated in with Provhost Lindsor and at that forum there was an opportunity for students to ask questions and just to get input and feedback, 
We are functioning as an advisory board to the president and provhost, we can make policy reccomendations and the cochairs are all participants on the board
I hop you all have a lot of questions for me
I should mention the best practices being used at other universities
Steven: considering that you had only handled faculty and grads previously, how do you think you will adapt to handeling potentially over 1000 students
DC: I am working closely with student affairs, this is something PTI mentioned on sat, they are in the process of restructuring, so there will be a new diversity position within that, there are services that are already existing within student affairs, my role is somewhat of a coordinator
Because there are efforts already in place, my role is to see how I can bring people together and how our university strategy is being met
DC: one other important thing, if you havnt read it, you should look at the white paper. It is being used by all the working groups to guide the work that we are doing. 
Aaron: as with all consils that get started it is a slow process, what is a very likely time frame for people to see tangible results from tis counsil
DC: I am asking for each of the working groups to answer what they think it is important to accomplish, there are long medium and short term projects. 
A lot of the work can be done independently of the counsil and we will do those things
Sarah: what do you see as ASG’s role?
DC: Haley stevens is serving on all of the working groups and is a member of the diversity counsil, we are in touch regularly, if there is something that ASG can do to support the counsil then ASG will be notified through Haley, and she can come ask for support
DC: by all means, if any of you every have a questions, feel free to give me a call or send me an e-mail
Ani: great, we will move into the SAFC elections
Girish: I will be very brief summary, we a re the group of ASG that allocated funds to the 40 or so A status groups. Qualities that I think are important:
Passion for groups
Time
Critical thinking skills
Experience with SOFO
I would like to open nominations, there are four open positions
Account execs advise three or four student groups, and help guide these groups. 
Ani: 4 non senator spots
Bidel: I have to leave for an exam: I have been on the board for a year, a few qualities, I have been heavily involved, I will be a senior industrial engineer, I have had a great time working with student groups, I am aware of the process. Next year anything that comes up, I will be a senior, I have to leave. Are there any quick questions, 
I am the captain of the NU quittich team
SCNO
ISA/NCSA
I have been involved and held significant leadership positions, 
Ani: okay were going to move into regular procedure:
Bill Craiger: econ stats, finance committee for A nad O attentaticve to detail I know what works and doesn’t work in student groups, trasurer of the frat, sofo certified. I would be a good asset to SAFC and student groups
Max Hogan: freshman, street team emmeber of A and O, productions and development committee, DR committee, we worked with the beenficiarry, SAE, pledge class president, assistant recruitment chair, passion and dedication to those activities
Amirt: sophomore transfer economic and math, NU as a whole is a pretty entrepenurial committee, the groups is something that I love. President of money think, more minor roles on campus, writer for NBR, grasp of NU campus, I applied to be a PA, class of 2016, SAFC is the next great way to work, I want to be able to coordinate and bring together A status group, give back to the entrepreurial culture
Sarah Green: Poli sci major, most of my time is spent with my sorority, member of the pre law frat on campus, a bunch of different things from a wide variety of areas, you have to be able to connect to a bunch of different interests, I always knew I wanted to be a part of ASG
Jason: I am Jason freshman bio med, I know I wanted to join ASG, I thought the Student Life was like student groups but I was wrong, I havea  strong interests in finding groups and grow them, I have experience I was treasurer of my high school student govt
Nebeu: sophomore studying sociology and econ, I was rteasurer of an A status group as my 3rd week as a freshman, I realize the importance of having a helpful AE, and funding those pit falls, since I was lucky to have an helpful AE as ASA’s treasurer
Serene Darwish: econ major, MCSA exec, NUCHR logistics and finance, grad school engineers, I help improve their English. Putting on good quality programming and dealing with the beaurocracy and be a resource for groups
Elliot Lazar: freshman industrial enginnerr, exec for frat, Mayfest, Finance, brief experience, brief internship at investment, passionate about student life and involvement, I see this at as a great opportunity to do this. That’s about it I am passionate about and exited about the opportunity to work on SAFC
Taylor: freshman, I want to apologize for being late, I am interested in this position because I would like to work in banking, I am a math major pursuing a finance in Kellog, I like working with numbers and budget, I was talking to Girish the other day, one of the main things about being on the SAFC is building a relationship with clubs. I understand new clubs and what they need to help them succeed, next year I will be a CA and I was selected for that because of my ability to establish relationships
Tom: sophomore in Weinberg studying econ and poli sci, I love the NU club community, social char of CSA, we throw a lot of big events with other clubs on campus, I am not stranger to throuwing events, I know ow the budget works, I have been involved in a bunch of other things, campus catylus for Globmed, lots of numbers and qualitative analysis, I was the treasurer for the biggest debate team in the country, I have experience with finance, I worked for a botique consulting firm, I am doing campus catylus, I think next quarter
Question and answer: please don’t ask personal questions, 
Mark: its great you have relationships with student groups, the SAFC has to make objective decisioons due to policy and you will find yourself arguing against groups that you like. 
Bill, I don’t want my money spent on people that don’t deserve it
Max: from being involved on a diverse group I have learned to love them individually and I am excited to get to know them and bring the mentality that each is unique and bring that mentality
Amrit: being able to tell a group that they don’t get the money they deserve, we have to be the people that determine where the money goes based on objective standards, even when it comes to telling a friend they cant get the money, while maintaining personal relationships
X: it’s a large responcibilities, it wont be difficult, you will be attending these events and see how they run and how they are responcible, if you do have a bias towards a group, you should think about before
Jason: it is easy to stay objective, I am not involved with the a status groups, having experience from sitting on the committee you can build relationships with the budgets you are advising, you can see where they are using the money most efficiently
Nebeo: the SAFC guildleines are clear for funding increase or decreasae, for them to secure their funding, if they are clear here is no reason not to be objective
X: my bias is towards the students and that they are getting the most for their money
Elliot: I don’t have my own interests in mind I am thinking about the NU community, I am going to listen to the SAFC handbook and do my job and do what is in the best interest for student Life
Taylor: I think the first reason to remain objective, I am honest, if they cant get more money than being objective is what we have to do. I am running for this because I want to dedicate myself to this group and that means being objective
Tom: I don’t think there is a conflct of interests, if you are doing what youre supposed to do. If they are running good events they get more increasae. 
Jane: fo all of you, would you raise you hand if you are involved with an A status groups that receives funding
Girish: for those of you, do you have plans to take on a leadership position in an A status group
Max: No, just an A and o committee
Amrit: No, im a part of ISBE which is not A status but were not ASG affiliated
Sarah: no, not as of now, I am trying to find my true passion and I think it could be here!
Jason: No
Nebeo: I was treasurer and president of an a status group, but I am don with that
Siri: committee, not president or treasurer
Elliot: committee, 
Taylor: the club I started is not recognized yet, as of next year, I will not be 
Tom: eventually I plan on becoming president of CSA and I think this will help me to do that, 
Bill: no 
OJ: the guidelines are great but when we review our guidelines, when do you think is an appropriate time to break the rules
Amrit: they should be made as a committee as a whole, it would require a group decision
Sarah: I am involved in Chicago area mentoring program, we take students that don’t have a high college opportunity, when a club s fantastic and small and has an opportunity to be better then you can break the rules
Jason: allowing other students to get involved, the role of student groups on campus is to include, if the finance is inhbiting that then they should get money
Nebeo: there are times when groups make mistakes, the last thing you want to do is leave a group crippled finantially, you have to look at the situation and break the rules
X: if bending them is to maximize the quality of the event
Elliot: when a group is in need of the support of the SAFC and the only way we can do that is by pushing the guidelines, our job is to maintain the student life at Nu and ensure thtat the student have the opportunity 
Taylor: I had prepared the same answere as serene if it is for the betterment of the group of NU and as the committee as a whole
Tom: I think the guidelines are strict but fair, the entire committee would have to come to the conclusion as a whole. Or if a club is in dire need of help
Bill: guidelines are important but if the choice is between best possible programming
X: groups don’t stay they same they get bigger smaller, fluidity
Motoki: how often are you on g-mail g chat, how available are you
Sarah: I am on it a lot
Jason: I think the worst is when people don’t email you back
Nebeo: as of last quarter: I am pretty available
Serene: I am a prompt responder
Elliot: very good at responding
Taylor: tech addict, always have my phone
Tom: check my email first thing in the morning

Andrew: Rep for Bob-Muccoloch, caller for Phone-a-thon, econ and LOC major, has been an org treasurer in the past, wants to learn more about ASG and student groups
John: Represents IFC, freshman, econ and poli sci, was treasurer of high school in 4 different orgs, 
Kevin: Sophomore, econ major, as dealt with a lot of money before, 
Ani: Moving to question period for Senator seats
Derrick Suen: If you have to choose between guidelines and supporting your group what do you do
Harsh: We all have different roles but we have to support the guidelines. 
Andrew: Stick to the guidelines because they set precedent but it is important to look at particular issues. If we want to bend rules we should talk to groups and explain. Fairness
John: I’m a fiscal conservative so theres that. What it comes down to is fairness to groups, we need to not play favorites and must manage everyone’s money. 
Kevin: Guidelines are there for a reason. You have to meet certain expectations. You can be flexible in certain circumstances.
What do you think are the most important characteristics
John: a thorough understanding of the rules: constant contact with the groups to provide steady advise
X: constant contact maintain dedication
X: genuine interest, organized, timely, responding to emails so they are aware of deadlines
X: dedicated and objective, learn about the groups, objective about the groups.

Girish: why do you want to be on SAFC
 Honsh: to share student experience
Andrew: more involved
John: play to my strengths
Kevin: skill sets and prior experiences, helping student groups to succeed. 
(Endorsements)
David: once again, in our continuing effort to increase the legitimacy of senate, are we comfortable with the fact tahat haf of us are not here during the delegation of the SAF. I ask that you might motion this to old business for the simple reason that you vote on this tonight
Mark: it get ambiguous with substitutes, if I have a sub that comes in that cannot vote, 
David: the code deals with that differently, i sponcered the legislation that if you’re a substitute you cannot vote
That is not covered in the scope of this bill
I think that would be a good amendment say that you cant have a sub without an excused absence 
Mark: no I mean that you have the sub a week ahead, then it would be acceptable to vote. 
Patrick: to clarify you would also have to be here the week before with you sub
David: I know that seems like a lot but guys, 1.4 million dollars
Motoki: so the bill requires that ANYBODY who has to vote has to be here the week before and for those who week the week before and cant vote,
David: you would not be brought to rules unless you miss the funding session itself, I am just drawing an arbitrary line but if you want to amend it, that would be fine with me, 
This is placing sanctions on yourself, if you want to make that tougher that’s fine
This is to increase legitimacy
Tori: motion to make this old business
Ian: point of inquiry: could we see this as old business next week?
David: we could but I see no reason to delay it. 
Patrick: we haven’t amended it, we have to do that once its old business, 
Brad: what david is trying to do is eliminate stress from a packed agenda, 
David: it would be silly to discuss this with professionals in the room when there is no need to discuss this with constituents
Ian: we don’t need to waste a half hour voting on amendments now when we can do it in 2 minutes next week
Patrick: we have all made up our minds on this lets vote
Alex: what would be a penalty for missing a session
David: it is up to the rules committee to decide
If you simply missed funding for reasons you cant explain, I think that’s grounds for expulsion, but if you have a reasonable case, you can just do some extra publicity or service to compensate. 
Its not my decision
Sarah: do you think it is important to set the precedence that funding is more important than other senates?
David: I think if you want to amend it to make this the case for all senates, but I think that 1.4 million dollars is more important, but 26 out of 51?! Common guys
Motoki: what constitutes as excused absence:
Brandon: I am pretty liberal, but studying doesn’t usually constitute as one. 
David: and if we find out youre lying that’s like BOOM! (shotgun action)
Mark: motion to amend: added after disciplinary review: 
(seconded)
this is the question I imposed to david, you cant have an alternate the week of, you must have the forsight to have an alternate in the week before, it is not as strict as it could be
David: let the records reflect it is a friendly amendment!
X: so if I have an alternate come the week before and then to rules, they could still deem it as unexcused
Mark: it could still be unexcused 
Mark: if you don’t have the foresight to have an alternate, 
Mark: I would like to rescend the amendment
PRO
CON: Motoki: I think over the past year and a half we have made a lot of canges in the code that would make funding way more of an important meeting in senate, because we have so many rules going into it, I think the absences are from those rules, why would I sit through the meeting I cant vote in, I think instead of adding more rules would be pointless. We need to look at the rules we already have. WE already have retention problems
PRO: david, I just disagree, if a senator wont take the 7 figure responcibility seriously, I don’t want them in the room, and I don’t want to retain them. Funding is something everyone understands, if yyou are not willing to participate I find that unacceptable and I would be comfortable if they don’t comprehend that
Steven: to go on that, I think its really important that we stress this to the max, and I think it’s a shame. It’s a significant thing, I think it is more of an incentive to make sure you show up a year before
TOri: the SAFC spends 40 hours making these decisions, the fact we ask senators to come in for 3 hours when we dedicate so much is so fair
CON: Ian: I will agree that there is a problem, but I do not think this is the way to address it, this demands a closer review and I have no problem re addressing this in the fall, we want to make sure we change our rule, 
Motion to postpone indefinitely
Jane: how many absences from the last funding were excused or unexcused, 
For A status: 6 excused 5 unexcused and 2 with half

David: I don’t think that puts a bearing on the bill. 
Ani: in line for a pro con to postpone indefinately:
Motoki: there is a lot we need to re look into, I don’t think we should be rushing to vote this in and we can, 
CON: david: if were gonna vote it down, vote it down, 
PRO: Ian: we like the principle, we want to postpone it to edit it to something that better suits what we are trying to achieve, 
We can call this bill up at any time, and at any time senate can vote at any time to bring it up as old business. 
Con: david: I think this is totally lame, the argument that we should postpone this iswe shouldn’t use voting as an introductory procedure, we should use our orientation as if I were to make fun of ASG I would 
PRO: steven, we have a lot of other stuff to do tonight, its already past nine thirty, we are going to have to extend time to get through old business. 
CON: abby: I don’t think new senators understand how important this is, I don’t see a point voting in the fall
(inline to vote on the bill as a whole)
(bill defeated)
Ani: conflict free campus: did you guys know, this is called the the Milton H Wilson Campus
Alex and Melanie: co presidents of stand, and anti genocide coalition and dedicated to overcoming genicide. The deadliest conflict currently, in the Congo. 
There have been over 5.4 million deaths in 20 years. Were talking about the highest rates of sexual violence that the world has ever seen. 
Every single one of our electronic products, they all are used minerals that are mined in the Congo, tantilum, tin and tungsten, gold, is used to cote the wiring, these end up in our phones
Armed groups are fighting to control the mines. 
Minerals are smuggled and shipped to smelters around the world
Local Congolese, and others agree that we need to reform this process to fix this problem
As college kids: we are consumers of these companies, American electronics companies sit at the top of these supply chains that start deep in the minds of the congos, we want to push for legitimate mining there. 
Motorola has already begun investing in the congo
NU as an institution has major pull with these companies, we can pass a conflict free resolution that would require the university to observe the companies they buy electronics from. 
We are in front of ASG to pledge the student body to this cause. A greater consciousness of our own impact
X: how many companies produce without conflict free minerals
Melanie: Motorola is not completely conflict free but they have gone the furthest, there is one very small company
Sarah: so is what youre saying that NU wants more research to be done to get conflict free products?
Alex: we want the admin to say something, at Stanford they passed a proxy company, at duke they have more of a statement to say that they don’t support conflict tech
we want northwestern to say if there is a company that would makes this conflict free tech, we will buy it. 
(old business)
(passes)
Brandon: code review, just to give a quick run through
A lot of minor things, 
A provision that exec must attend senate
Same standard for exec as senators. They can be impeached.
PR requirement has been extended to exec
Parliamentarian calls role at attendance
Parliamentarian maintains a calendar
Treasurer assisting the PR VP after SAF funded events
All these things should have been codified before. 
(Passes)
(motion to extend senate by ½ hour) 10 pm. 
X: there is a lack of gender neutral bathrooms and transgender individuals have serious reservations about using gender specific bathrooms, 
he feels uncomfortable in women’s bathrooms but he presents more feminine than people who are biologically male, 
we would like to see more help from the university
they are adding 3 to tech but that is not enough, they havnt said anything about what is going to happen in Norris, in kresge, gender appropriate available and convenient. It is a lack on campus, I would love to see this passed. 
X: I am curious about the logistics of adding bathrooms:
X: just looking at harris and kresge, harris was just renovated, it is almost a complete reconstruction of kresge, they are going to be replacing the plumming anyways, for something like Norris or the library, it is trickier, but at the same time we cant let logistics get in the way of principle, if we say it is logistically too difficult. We would like to see the show of support from ASG
Victor: is there anything else you would like us to do that this mandates. 
X: not persay, I don’t know how many of you are aware, we have a petition, I can ask ani to send it around with the announcements, it is an invisible issue, that transgender rights are overlooked. Don’t get complacent, keep talking don’t let the university forget about it
Brad: motion to move this to old business:
Ani: all in favor of moving this to old business
(passed)
(PQ)
(passed)
Ani: diversity committee legislation
Brad: senate passed during winter quarter, in the wake of incidents on campus, create a sustainable committee in the future, it will be overseen by Student life, if it is passed we have an application to send out for an associate vp. 
Haley: so far we are working with NU for diversity now
I have been working with donna
NU diversity counsil
Working with Bergie on respect NU
We set up our goals for the year
We want to work on student groups
X: this is the commission? And then there is a counsil too?
Brad: yes, this is entirely students, students who are in ASG sit on the other commission but that is coincidence
Motoki: what is the need for making this a committee
Haley: this isnt an issue that is going away, this is a means to institutionalize it. In the future if there are incidents, we want to be able to support them
Brad: before it was just floating around, now it is put within a position in ASG and hold them accountable
Sarah: I am curious as to where the assistant vp fits within the structure. 
Brad: they are not sitting in on exec, there are other committees that have director committees, I think this person meets with SLVP 
The reason they are associate VP not director, with think it is an important position and it sends the right message to the student body. 
Jane: how will this position report to alex if he has no say as to who is in the committee
Brad: the SLVP the EVP and the director of the coalition of colors helps to elect this person and he regulates and attends meetings. 
Motoki: are there any road blocks that you have encountered as an ad hoc committee, 
Haley: we think preemptively this will help
Jane: does she become a member of the SLVP or is she separate
Brad: they can sit in 
Motoki: how is the power balanced? Do we have any accountability to the chair of the coalition of colors?
Brad: the original bill had them in and we wanted to respect senates decision to do that
(PQ)
(passed)
Ani: increasing election transparency: 
Steven: it was tabled, I wont re hash it, you know what it is, it coedifies a practice that has occurred for years but this shines a light on the matter. Basically there has been a practice where people who consider running for these roles meet with admin to build an idea of what campus is like however, you are not allowed to have campaigning prior to the campaign period, so I would like for candidates to declare to an election committee and that that is the reason they would like to meet with them, this doesn’t do much that is new, it just clarifies and ensures that there is no misunderstanding, 
X: does the commission exist in winter quarter
Steven: what this would do is ensure that the commission exists in the beginning of the winter quarter. 
This same ruling would apply to the rules
David: do you think this adds pressure far earlier than is the norm, 
Steven: it may but I think ultimately for the sake of everyone who wants to run. You don’t have to declare, preparation should be clear
Brad: and you can withdraw
Alex matelski: is there an earliest time that you can declare?
(Debate period)
CON: Ani: I think this adds a lot of pressure and distraction, we are not supposed to worry about this, if this goes and is submitted to ASG, its public, the media would get it, the attention would be on the race and not the governing, the stakes are elevated for no reason. 
David: I understand the principle, and I know that Victor and Brad were meeting with people intending to run
Running is an arms race. 
PRO: I am making a pro, I understand where ani and david are coming from but I think it also solves a lot, victor and I had our first meeting in the beginning of November. The rules are incredibly vague and the way they are written right now, you cant say you are running but we said we are considering or we are planning. At that time it was at the speakers discretion before the commission was formed. 
Steven: the fact that we had to go to one person who had ultimate discretion over all the rules. Would have more attention on us be bad?
CON: david: its not drawing attention to the productive things were doing, its drawing attention to the unproductive things were doing. I really don’t think legitimizing an earlier start to the campaign is the right way to go, I want to reitereate that elections are an arms race
Steven, I know you hadn’t finialized your plans until later in the process and I think if people had know that you victor and brad started in November and you started later it would have harmed you and I think in practice this wont be an effective change
PRO: Ian, meeting with student leaders, I think this is a spectacular idea, anyone who is paying attention will know who is running, if anyone in this room who cares to know what is going on, will know. The same things would happen but this is more on record, especially for people who do not know how to run for office, 
Steven: I would say that I am open to other possibilities and that’s what this is for, but the majority of people who ran for positions are supporting this bill
Victor: it seems like the concern that people have is distracting from the governance of the student body? There is a PR issue?
Steven: we have a PR issue and we always have, if we can get that, whats the problem on having a lot of attention on us
CON: Ani: when you announce, you are calling attention to what will be done rather than what is being done. Right before the election, we passed an amendment to the guidelines those regulations are already happening, pres and VP are entitles to the privacy to explore options
If my friends saw that ASG elections are coming up, what have you guys done yet?
Motoki: as someone on the commission, we didn’t see pre campaigning as a problem so this doesn’t seem necessary. 
PRO: Mark: there is nowhere that says that they have to declare, it would just be sent to the commission, 
Brad: the daily couldn’t write an article if the commission cant verify. 
Steven: this is something, its not a candidacy declaration
Sarah: everything that david and ani had mentioned, I think we have to think about the difference between our intention and what will happen, if you are telling student group leaders that they are running, 
Ani: I think if something is sent to the rules committee, it is open record, I have worked for the daily and I know how they write articles, if its an official ASG document, that’s news, 
(PQ)
(bill fails)
Steven: Campaign cutback, basically, just trying to consolidate some of the time we spend on campaigns, in the past we could go door to door and were not allowed to do that anymore, that is a significant amount of time that is now spent on chalking. Some say that it went a bit to long and now I agree. I am just going to put this on the table. 
X: you said that candidates cant come into residential colleges, 
Ian: the rule is there is no door to door solicitation allowed but they can come into munchies
Steven: I am open to suggestions
PRO: Ian: if there is one thing that comes out of this campaign period, the amount of work I put into that campaign, my academics suffered, I was upset with the amount of time I had to put into this. The main things you are going to need to do, this can all be done within a week, there is no need to drag it on for so long
Tori: the campaign takes away from other programming that is occurring on campus. It clogged fb it clogged the ground, I would say as a student I hated it. 
CON: abby, I do realize it sucks for candidates, but I think we are losing sights of what it is for, the student body pays attention to those days and I think it is important that the student body is heard
Motoki: once you cut from 10 days to 7 you are limiting the amount of time we have for debates we didn’t have time to work around the schedules from these guys, you are going to have to schedule a debate the day after they declare for candidacy. 
PRO: steven: its great that we had an increase in voting but that also comes with a decrease in what we are allowed to do. A lot of facebook and chalking turn out, yielded more votes than door to door. 
CON: sarah: I want to say that during the election something I enjoyed was hearing people debating the candidates and caring about what was happening and it took time for people to understand where they stood on the issues, I don’t want to loose the people who care about what is going on
Brad: I agree with steven and ian that it is a burden on grades, however I think we have a duty to the student body to give them as much information as possible. We had to sent campaign managers to speak for us
Mark: motion to amend: I motion to extend the length of campaigning to 31 days… it was a joke. 
Motoki: (postpone indefinitely)
(PQ)
(defeated)
Amendment rescinded: 
ANi: original bill, 
Brad: new sustainability committee
X: is there a reson why we cant have this out as a working group to see how it goes?
Brad: we have had that in the past, 
Mark: like diversity, sustainability is not going anywhere
(bill passed)
Brad: working groups on alc policy and culture: we have a forum coming up, we want to do some more research, the committee will include several different leading group representatives as well as 2 senators
Patrick: how long will it take to elect those two senators. 
Brad: not pertinent
PRO: whats great is that we are trying to reach out to all living spaces, with the admin pushing for more upperclassman housing, this is wonderful RCB supports it and has people lined up to support it
(PQ)

Dave – this isn’t just a Greek issue, lived in dorm freshman year, understands how alcohol policy affects res life





Senate 5/9
Ani: We have a packed meeting tonight, here is the ASG project report, senate requested this outline of priorities. Were are putting a lot of information online by replacing google docs so we will have that opened up to you so you can view legislation online. Be on the look out for that, 
Brad: while they try to get this up, I want to preface the presentation and we had the exec board retreat last sat and we came up with over 200 things, not all of them are in this presentation, this represents our priorities and we will be publishing the entire lists but this will basically summarize basic points from the retreat and in addition to things that are not on the list we really want feedback from you. This is not a check list and its not like at the end of they year we will be able to cross all of these off I is more of a guide for this year
Victor: our big theme is connecting NU. Providing resources to student groups, creating and facilitating an environment so students can reach their full potential. 
Every project we plan on pursing falls into one of these categories
We want to better the NU experience and lay down the groundwork for long term goals, for everything we don’t finish we want to make sure we provide the tools needed to do so
We want to answer the question “what is asg” for all students
We want to raise legitimacy and prestige. We should be the best group on campus, we have a lot of power and we serve as the liaison between students and admin. We should have the best people in here
Brad: developing a stronger sense of community. We will be having several events inviting in new committee members and senators. Tomorrow or Friday everyone will be added to an all ASG listserv so we can all communicate and create a cohesive sense
Training and increasing senator competition. 
Facilitating leadership opportunities
Expanding institutional memory: using google drive which will be integrated with our new site, we will have all minutes up so you will never have to repeat work
Victor: we have broken down all projects by committee
Academics: working to improve the curriculum, diversity and inclusion requirement, we want a lot of research on this so that we provide something that is really valuable to students, Environmental classes… etc. all fitting within the strategic plan and also connecting our community to more global cultures.

Mentoring and shadowing
Faculty student interaction grants so students can get to know profs

Steven: in addition to what we have done this year like the housing fair,
Occupancy reform, a new committee through student counsel with students on, we also have other ideas in mind that will be less formal
Voter registration, in april there are municipal elections for the alderman and the mayor and we want students voting 
Protests response code reform, after UC david and UC berkely, we are glad to see the police advisory board and hopefully we can get them to clarify what the protest response is for the UPD so we never have students in danger if they are not causing harm
We want to expand our volunteer opportunities and expand that year by year, we would like to have some large fair once a year so students can know whats going on in Evanston and Chicago. 
Brad: one of our major themes is connecting NU and so were really looking to collaborate with groups that are already doing these things instead of creating our own, and if you have ideas for us please reach out
Brad: what were going to propose in the future, is the creation of two sub committees under student life, one already exists which is the Diversity committee. We would make the chair of this committee an assistant of the Student life committee. 
MSA resource funding
Gender neutral bathrooms
Bias response team and protocol for that, they are working on that with Bergie
The other committee to go under student life would be Sustainability
Brad: a large part of my role is working on internal management, were going to propose some changes to 5K which would make it a 10K initiative and we would switch the chair of the committee the VP rather than the P and we will come through with some legislation for that
Alc Culture and Policy Forum with PTI Bergie and Lisa currie, its only open to student leaders. 
All ASG meetings and social events, so everyone actually knows everyone in this room

Brad: we just ran through a bunch of those but its only half and if you want any more info well send it out
Ethan: WOO! ALRIGHT! We have a lot of cool projects in the works, the main web site answering what is ASG who are we and What are we doing oh and How to get involves. Expression NU getting feedback from NU students, im most excited about My NU, we have no student groups list and I want to solve that problem via a site that provides a customizable homepage and an events calendar, book swap 2.0, a committee member interested in developing that, the unofficial student guide, we are getting that together and well have that ready for the fall. 
Brad: wrapping up, after we camp up with all of this, we are proposing creating working group for all of these but we will propose an alc safety working group with Greek communities among others, and then a few members from senate, if your interested come talk to me. PTI has given us the research go ahead, everything else is something that has already been in existence. 
Victor: that’s it, this is preliminary and by the end of the year we want to give this out to administrators and we want you to be able to answer what ASG is doing. If you have suggestions please send them our way. 
Ani: SGC funding is new business that I will send to you, quick housekeeping things
For A status groups, were working off the updated one and Girish will motion to accept all amendments made
Lets be respectful of everyone who is talking, on your laptops, unless youre taking notes, please keep your typing to a minimum and if youre scrolling, only scroll through the funding 
We will be going through two rounds, the first will be a cut round, ill go through pretty slowly, anyone can make a motion but you need a second by a senator. If you weren’t here last week you cannot vote. You cannot vote if you’re a senator for your student group. 
The second pass is an add round, funds can only be added to line items in the funding request, you cant add line items, keep in mind, when were funding, were not transferring money from one group to another, were doing from a pool. Lets not be outrageous, the funds added will be consistent with SAFC guidelines. 
Girish: just taking a step back, lets go through the amendments we came up with last night, 18 groups came in and the changes are reflected here on the screen, there were no cuts only adds
NXE: 16000+ and vocal coaching
College dems
NCSA
MCSA SASA 500 honorarium
SASA 1600 live band
Art alliance 600 storage
KASA 
PAR 1950 honorarium

Unity 300 honorarium
Rainbow
Habitat 299 transport
College reps 300 
FMO 14960 honorarium 200 publicity 500 pulse mag publication
These are all reflected in the document, motion to amend them all 
Ian: is the reason for them insufficient tiering,
Girish: yes, small issues on apps and KASA reevaluated after the event had happened
Ani: any pros? Any cons?
Ian: motion to PQ
(passed)
54000 is the senate amendment pool and if we cut it goes right to that pool
Girish: there are 54000 dollars in the pool and you do not have to use all of it, if you don’t it goes to the sub cycle, and a lot of groups plan on using that, don’t look to spend all of that. 
Ani: in the add round when you vote to add youre taking from that pool, we can go into deficit but when we wipe that balance we have to cut from groups too
CUT ROUND:
ADD ROUND:
NPHC: (Kalvin Pocu) Motion to add 500 dollars for the DJ for greek because before we had the event, but we had it last Saturday now that the event happened we would like to ask for it. 
Girish: in the past you were funding 250, would you like for that?
Kalvin: no, 500
X: we initially didn’t fund them because the event handing happened when they applied, the increase is a 13% increase for the event, the pool isnt growing enough to sustain that but we would be comfortable if they asked for a lower amount. 
PRO Kalvin: maybe im confused, 500 is usually the amount we were given but it is fair to say we would accept 
Girish: for another event you got 500, not this one you received 250
Derrick: excuse me, we are comfortable
Mark: SAFC is consistent with this?
Girish: yes
(motion to PQ)
(passed)
Kalvin: we would like to 4000 dollars for our honorarium host, the event didn’t occur before when we had asked for funding but last year we brought don rollings from the chapelle show that is how much he costs and we would like to keep up that level of entertainment
Derrick: this is what we mentioned earlier, they were funded 3500 last year and that would be a 750 $ increase but this is not sustainable despite their success we would be more comfortable with a smaller increase. 
PRO April: they should be funding bc the host was very funny and it is important that we get this money to maintain the quality of this event. Why not?
CON Girish: we cant sustain 13% increases, this board can support that, 
Kalvin: to be in compliance, can we ask for 3700$ instead? For the greek scene honorarium. 
Ani: we withdrew 4000 for 3700 amendment
(motion to PQ)
Ani: all in favor of awarding this (passed)
Mayfest
Motion to add 1250 to the lakefill activities on the lakefill, this is important because it keeps people there during the concerts, were asking for it now because in the past the NCAF we have received this money but CSI helped us also, their funding got cut though so this is our main source of income
Greg: if you look at the packet, mayfest, we gave them a 4.1 % increase and we reward them for continued successful programming and Mayfest usually comes ask during supplemental funding. 
Ian: have you reached out to other orgs to sponsor this?
Mayfest: yes we got a NU night grant but such a huge portion came from CSI that we need to secure this money now to make sure we have funding
Jane: you said you received a grant how much and what was it for, have you approached RHA and RCB
Mayfest: We got 400 dollars and we work with RHA for art
Ani we will move into a debate period
PRO
CON Girish: the pool only grows at 4%. We support these activities but we cant allow mayfest to exceed the growth of the pool
X: what percent does this change the increase to. 
4.8%
X: if you don’t get it from here where would you go?
Mayfest: we want money to be used by groups for their own programming and so there is not a lot of money just sitting around
X: what activities do you want?
There are some activities that already have really long lines and they are expensive because they 
have to be staffed so we would cut those, 
X:Have you approached the provost?
Mayfest:Have you met provost lindsor?
Ani: all in favor of funding this event (denied)

Arts Alliance
Kylie: Motion to add 575$ to our meow preview show, the content is different from main stage show, it is different programming and we did not clearly explain that to SAFC
SAFC: the board wasn’t sure between the preview and main stage, when they came to amend it we learned the different and we are willing to fund this
Motoki: is there a specific item that this is being added to?
Kylie: yes, there are several different line items, for simplicity and time, 
Kylie: motion for 75$ in publicity
(passed)
Kylie: motion to add 500$ in lighting materials, lighting comes out to be over 1000 dollars so anything would help. 
(motion to PQ)
Ani: all in favor of adding 500 $ to lighting
(passed)
Kylie: motion to add 150$ to venue for the Great Room, it is the standard rental fee for Jones and it is essential for this programming to happen
X:I know the amount that were look at right now is only 150, we need to look at it from the big picture, they are new to the A status pool and we are already funding them 50000 and the extra 150 is adding more to an already huge amount and they can get funding from other groups
Kylie: Arts Alliance has been providing these events for a long time and we are well aware of what we need, and internally we have been going strong for 35 years
PROS:
CONS:
(Motion to PQ)
(does not pass)
A&O
Logan: Motion to make winter speaker event a winter speaker series. SO thanks for being here, were here for the third consecutive year to talk about the format. We originally petitioned for the series and it was never brought up in our SAFC interview. You may be familiar with this debate, you have allowed us in the past. The format of the series allows us to bring the best speakers we can to campus, both of our events have sold out. This allows us to be successful because we can book acts simultaneously. For us this is better so that the artists that are available that are better and cheaper we can book and secure. It also allows us to deal with venues. Pick stager is very difficult with dates, and we can only hold dates for a small amount of time. Third, the series allows us to avoid the contract mess with CSI, if we didn’t have the series we would have to petition after the contract was signed. We literally got contracts in the week before. This created a whole new mess of time constraints. 
SAFC/Girish: the fundamental reason why we as a board disagree with this is because it is against our guidelines, we don’t want groups to be able to spend money on whatever they want. The central theme of our guidelines is funding consistently successful events on campus so if a group put on 2 successful 30 thousand dollar speakers we know that are capable of this. This does not translate to the ability of a group to throw one successful 60 thousand dollar speakers. Just bc they are both speakers on concerts doesn’t mean that they are the same kind of events. This will not lead to consistently good programming on campus. 
X: what are we voting for? Are we proposing to split the original speaker funding? 
Girish: right now they are funded one winter speaker they would like to split that up to as many as they would like
X: motoki: why havnt you started to petition to two separate events
Logan: when you negotiate with artists or speakers, it is a fickle process, one day I could approach them at 35000 dollars and we want to send them an offer, the next day the agent could change that to 38K now, because that’s where artists are getting their money. So they have the ability to negotiate that way. The series allows us to negotiate freely, so we don’t loose out quicker on artists. Petitioning forces us to wait. 
X: have we lost out on speakers in the last two or three years? 
Max: briefly, with the term lost out, we do send offers to artists that don’t accept, the artists we consider range from 15 to 100 thousand dollars and sometimes we need the flexibility to make our best offers. 
X: where do ticket sales go?
Girish: 25% goes back to A&Os 00 and the rest goes to the project pool
PRO: there is a good chance that if we hadn’t had the series we would not be successful we began planning at the beginning of the year the challenges of other programming, we were working on a timeline that wasn’t practical, we wanted to move our second speaker into the spring, if we have been on a single speaker funding line item we couldn’t have done that after having had our other contracts in. the second thing, this is something that has been approved by senate in the past two years and we think it is integral in moving forward. So we have learned from our mistakes. The money coming from ticket sales and the fact that we had good turn out has allowed us to move forward
CON: Omar: primarily, both sides have decided that it would be more advantageous to not have 2 events, single speaker set is better because 2 speakers doesn’t allow offers to go up to the maximum amount. With the singer speaker format, they can extend offers all the way up and when they have an acceptance they can petition to move funds over, not until they have acceptance can they do this, this is what has happened historically, usually the second speaker happened in the spring. There have been 2 years. 2 years ago the second part of the series, the SAFC lost its oversight and that is the purpose of the SAFC, this is the students money and we need to be able to evaluate it properly, we don’t make these recs on a whim, and the reason we make good recs is because we are part of the process all the way through. This is outside of our guidelines, they can have the ability to do whatever they want with the money. We have turned other groups down who have also attempted this format
PRO Logan: once we have signed contracts back we can petition, not before. The contract process is not consistent, if you remember back in the fall Lupe was leaked before the contract was signed and attendance suffered because of it. This is not just a giant pool of money we can do whatever we want with, its for a specific series, and in all honesty we put on a lot of program anyways, it just makes it easier to put on these two speakers as we have done for years now. 
CON SAFC: I want to clarify in case there is misunderstanding, in a series youre getting one honorarium used for any number of speakers. This is not how the guidelines work, I think you guys mentioned you wouldn’t use the money for anything, that’s fine, but nobody will know how many speakers you will bring in, that lack of clarity makes it hard for the board to figure out how to evaluate the event. If you have one speakers that you bring in for 300000 dollars, and you keep changing the amount for events and the number of people that comes for event will not be able judge and A&) can be evaluated. About the simultaneous booking, all groups are subjected to this. They can petition, all groups that want series can do this and we are flexible and we work hard to get good results for you. We need to be able to figure out how to evaluate you guys for the NU community so you continue to have good programming. 
PRO Steven: I was a senator last year and we passed the same amendment last year, they proved that it worked this year and I understand contractual programs, I voted in favor for it last year. Just judge the pros and cons, but consider your interests and that of other students
CON Kelsey: to reiterate what we have been saying, this is a huge risk it sets a precedent for AO and all groups. If there is one great event and one poor event, its hard to determine what to do with that. We can ensure the best use of funds are going into place. We highly respect you guys but we need to make sure that optimum programming is provided for all groups. Were against splitting this. 
(Motion to extend)
PRO Logan: it wouldn’t make sense for us to put on many many programs, if we did like 6 more speakers, it would be a burden on all of our committees, 2 speakers makes sense for us. This fits within our organization framework. SAFC points to a lot of hypothetical’s, we need to look at what has happened, 2 great sell out shows. 
Mark: what does A&O spend their budget on?
X: when were not funded we use it to supplement what we are not funded things that were not necessarily funded for. 
CON Jeremy: I am the previous FVP, in my mind there is a happy medium between these two proposals, between a series and a single event. I think we should be splitting this into 2 events, it would allow the increase of their purchase power. Right now with the speaker series there could be any split. When groups come to petition they have to know what they want, if different circumstances come into play, they could petition before the events happen. In my mind a group should have to decide what they want before hand and if the situation arises where they want to change that they can. 
Ani: we are in line for a vote
(does not pass)
College Republicans
Dane: motion for 100 dollars for fall speaker honorarium. In the fall quarter we spent our money on Andrew Brighbard and we brought in over 100 people on that. The year prior to that our turn out was dismal so we have had an increase in attendance and since that we have had two very successful events with one 80 person and one 400 person with Herman Cain. Its hard to book speakers for anything less than 10000 dollars and an 1000 increase will allow us to draw larger audiences. 
SAFC: college reps is asking for an additional increase in funding, before it was funded 5000 this would double the % increase. We have increased their funding because they have increased attendance and they co sponsored. Were increasing them a lot, in the past more groups have increased more than 40 people, if something is wildly successful we might increase 8 % or 15% max, they are asking for 20% increase for a marginally successful event increase. 
Dane: last fall when we spent out 5000, we were amazed we got that many people to come, he was what we were able to afford but we were able to get over 100 people in a far shorter amount of time. 
Mark: could you speak to the student increase?
SAFC: if you go that far back it was 75 to a 115 percent increase. Its not just honorarium increase. We don’t know how many students. 
PRO: although the numbers make it sound like an exorbitant amount, this is an organization that has proven itself and would like to continue to do so. We are trying to throw bipartisan events to learn. I think these increases will really help that and with this money I think you will be really surprised by what we can do
CON Paul: using the argument that with an extra 1000 dollars, every group would benefit from that. I don’t think that that is a good enough argument. 
PRO Jane: its bringing the whole NU community together 
CON Anna: hi, just basically a 20% increase is a lot, this is not a huge amount of increase in audience, we want to treat all students as equally as possible. 
(motion to PQ)
(motion does not pass)
OSB
Motion 400$ for travel, we have an honorarium, as far as travel is concerned, 400 $ is an adequate amount. 
SAFC Girish: this year this event had a decrease in attendance, you could petition to move your funds to travel. 
PRO: 
CON:
X: is there a reason why you’re doing it now instead of petitioning, 
OSB: I am not sure that splitting honorarium is feasible, rescinding the motion. 
ASB
Jenny: outgoing program director, displayed lack of demonstrated need. Our events are huge financial liability. The insurance on our vans is not very good, the buffer is necessary incase we need to pay for damage. The buffer in our account is necessary and you never no. the second reason is sometimes we have unforeseen housing fees that we try not to, sometimes orgs have fees for participating. Paying to volunteer isn’t a sustainable fee. The money we have in our account is an extra buffer. Increasing popularity in out trips, because of the distance of these trips we have to fly and these trips are very expensive. We want to be able to put on more of a variety of trips. We are asking for 225
Tori: ASB has a large 00 to cover some of their costs, we want them to spend it down and when asked they kept it as a comfort thing. We don’t see the need for these funds because they already have so much. 
Jenny: the buffer is for when participants pay extra for this buffer, the more SAFC funds us the less we can ask for from participants. 
Tori: their 00 is approximately 30,000 dollars. 
Mary Grace: why do you have such a large 00?
Jenny: we sent 2 class trips to Arizona and Mexico, the tickets cost a lot, and last year we sent two trips internationally, we paid contracts we had to front, van deductibles are so high. This year we had to pay a huge amount in liabilities, in order for us to not have to worry about every detail. 
Jane: how many students did you fly for 15000?
Jenny: 26 in all
Michele: how did you get the 225 amount? How would this be a security?
Jenny: it is a tiring for the winter trips in particular. We did it at the advise of our AE
Amalia: how many students would this benefit?
Jenny: if you give us 2240 dollars, it comes out to about 50$ a person, so we can change everyone more or put on fewer trips
PRO Jenny: SAFC addressed the fact that the buffer in our account is a buffer, but this year we have spent more than we have in the past, this year we paid for t shirts and water bottles and for more sight fees. We can use those things to et our sight leaders to a retreat off campus but this is something that will happen from our 00 next year. I don’t think 30000 is crazy to have for a group like ASB’s caliber. 
CON Tori: we are not targeting ASB, the requirement is that only 3% of what we fund them and 30000 is well over that
(PQ)
(motion does not pass)
ASB: Jenny: Motion to pass, help offset the costs for motor pool now and help offset any costs that we incur now. 
Tori: the same argument as before, the housing thing and motor pool, we don’t fund these things. 
PRO Mat: participant fees, whenever money we can subsidize, whatever money we get through funding goes into that subsidy. By getting this extra 1200 we would allow more people to go. Were not spending the extra money from the motor pool, but the cost of renting vans from motor pool, it would ultimately got to paying for more vans. 
CON:
(PQ)
(motion does not pass)
ASA
Michele: Motion to 300 dollars for honorarium, every year we have Africa awareness month surrounding a theme, this year we did African youth. We have an honorarium. We had Malik Coumaura come as well as Loyola’s dance team. The event brought in 60 people, events like this makes ASAs programming memorable
SAFC: initially we were uncomfortable because of insufficient teiring, but now were comfortable at this amount
(PQ)
(approved)
AATE
Jessica: Motion to add 50 for sets props and costumes we were funded at decrease because of decrease in attendance. we did one less event but were still compared to the same number. 
SAFC: we are comfortable with the 50$ that they ask for
(PQ)
(passes)
Jessica: motion to add 100 to lights, we were funded at a decrease for the same reasons, there were students admitted for free and were not counted in our rev
SAFC: attendance decreased 7%, the 100$ is too much compared to the cut they experienced in attendance. 
Ian: with the 50 increase what does total increase come to?
X:did you say you admitted students could come for free from classes?
Jessica: we did one less show, and yes there were about 15 students per night who came for free
Motoki: why one less show?
Jessica: I want on the board
Mark: why were they allowed to come for free?
Jessica: those tickets were not sold, it would add up to about 60 students who came and it would put our attendance at the same as last year. 
PRO Eric: I think we need to remember that the attendance calculations are not correct so to penalized them wouldn’t be correct
SAFC: I went to one of the shows, given this, based on the attendance I saw, there was still a decrease overall just not as much as we believed before which why we agree to the 50 but not the 100
PRO Jessica: once again, there was not a decrease, 
Motoki: were those 60 students required to come?
Jessica: No
Mark: where does the money for those ticket sales go?
Jessica: the show fund
SAFC: if they are funded at the 50, it would be only a 4% decrease and if they receive the 100 it would be a little over a 1% increase. 
(motion to PQ)
(passes)
FMO
FMO: Motion to add 250$ 2 years ago there was a complication with our publication and this past year we didn’t get any funding but we still put out an online publication and the quality is there, we re built the org and we don’t have to deal with the same issues. We are asking for 250 from the old 700 to build up the publication. 
SAFC: we are comfortable with this
(pq)
(passes)
NCDC
Amalia: Motion for 360 for our storage. NCDC uses storage in a uhaul for decorations, in the past we funded this through general funds and this has drained our 00. We put a lot of decorations in here and so its saving money by not having to buy new decorations. 
SAFC: if you look at the events we have funded in full in the past, if you look at the 2011 number they were funded at a 5% increase and if they are funded this it would be a 7.! % increase which is higher than the amount we fund groups as a whole. 
Eric: do you know how much you would save on storage in the future? 
Amalia: we would be asking for 800 every year
Mark: whats the size of the storage facility
Amalia: 8x8, the smallest size
PRO Amalia: I would like to point out with storage, although were not a theatre group, they are funded in full. Were using it ever year. We wouldn’t be asking for an increase next year, it would be standardized. 
CON Anna: we already increased their storage funding by 200 dollars, although we understand the necessity, from the boards perspective, we have to take into consideration the percentage increase. Its not the best choice for all student groups
PRO eric: like any group on campus that provides entertainment, I think we should fully fund. I would like to see this group expand rather than grapple with expenses
Amalia: if our 00 gets depleted, we will have to start asking for thousands for decorations. we have 4000 in our 00. 
CON Ana: same thing, once again, we gave you an increase in storage and as a board we would ask you to come back and get an increase, we want to be fair to everyone and this is not how we fund. 
PRO Amalia: theater groups are funded in full for storage
PRO: during all the programming, our 00 has been considerably depleted. 
PRO Amalia: with that fixed cost and without the increase, this is something that has been happening in recent events because out events have gotten so huge we would like to continue to put on events of this caliber. 
CON Greg: theater groups prioritize storage over programming, we have already given the group a large increase
(pq)

Amalia: motion to add 1500$ to project pumpkin
Some if not all of you might be wondering why I am dressed like I am from game of thrones, I do not know. Winter is coming, NCDC has always struggled with funding, and their hatred of candy. Ill take you to the candy shop, ill let you lick the lollipop go ahead SAFC don’t you stop. NCDC demonstrates the happiness candy brings. Project pumpkin needs this, do this so that the children of the world wont be denied a delight. As a parting sentiment I want to quote my favorite owl because I know many, how many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop, depending on how you vote, nobody may ever know. 
SAFC: we know facts, you may think this is a light matter. Funding candy risks children. No candy for da children. Though NCDC may put up a front of being happy caring people they are trying to manipulate us into giving them an illegal good that we may not fund. They are jeopardizing the children. SAF funds to purchase candy is an illegal use of our money, SAFC shall not fund food. There is not contractual need. When students pay the 150$ fee, it would STILL be illegal if it was used for students, but these students are not affiliated with the university and don’t pay the student activities fee. How does candy enrich the minds and benefit the minds of these kids. Why are these kids even eating candy in the first place? We should be helping these kids do good things with their minds and floss. In attempts to deepen the corruption of senate even further than it already is, they would rather see an extra 200 dollars in kids eating candy rather than bringing more kids here. In conclusion, the notorious BIG once postulated more money more problems. If any more money is going to NCDC we have a hell of a lot more problem. 
PRO Mark: I would like to contest the argument of the SAFC that candy is food. According to our govt june 1 2010, any sweet that has flour, cannot be taxed. Candy is not food and thus able to be funded by the SAFC
Girish: according to Wiki answers, it is edible to I think yes
CON Alex: I think its important that the people of the realm remember that the people of the realm are threatened
PRO Amalia: senate has always funded us candy money we have never asked for an increase and if there was ever extra we would give it to the rest of the people at the event. 
(PQ)
(passed)
Amalia: motion to add 750$ to busses, a bunch of kids come to NU to celebrate Halloween, these children come because they don’t have a place to trick or treat safely, it benefits NU as well, this past year we went 1000 over budget that we took from 00 because we don’t want to deny these kids. It’s the same number of kids we have brought every year it is an event that we put on for NU. 
Tori: since we funded candy, this would be a 15% increase, and we have already given a 500$ increase by transport alone. 
PRO Mark: as the in house environmentalists I hate buses and children. I think this is a great program
Amalia: we have been bringing the same number of children the past few years, how does this effect you guys? If we got the funded we were allocated now we would have to choose which children to say no to and then some NU volunteers wouldn’t be allowed to participate, we don’t want to turn people down its not in NCDCs mission. 
CON Tori: this event is directed towards kids and not an increase in NU students so it is not in our guidelines. 
PRO Steven: from a community relations standpoint, it makes NU students look really good and we can really use all the help we can get making us look good given that Dillo day is coming up. 
Amalia: we have seen an increase in student involvement in terms of booths. We have reached out more and more to student groups and there are large numbers of people who want to be chaperones, we asked the students what they want to see we have a huge haunted house and we would love to see a ton of students to come to help increase this event. 
CON Ana: steve brought up a great point with Com relations, SAF is not meant for community relations, it must be used primarily and directly benefit students. We all understand the NCDC is primarily philanthropic but the board cant treat groups differently based on their intent. Based on the scenario, even if youre bringing in the same amount of kids, there is no noticeable change. This is just a very high amount and we would fund any other group with this amount
Ian: amalia, would you seek to bring the same amount of kids depending on whether or not you were funding, you would see a drop
Amalia: yes, we would have to cut a sight. 
(PQ)
(does not pass)
Amalis: I would like to motion for 600, we would have to cut at least one if not more, that decision to cut all those little kids, to come and not allowing the NU volunteers to come and see the little kids go through project pumpkin. It is an event that all NU students can come with these kids and dress up
SAFC Tori: with this 600 dollars it would be a 13% increase, mayfest would have been a less than 1% increase, this group should not be viewed any differently, we are cause blind and you guys should as well. This event does not reach that many NU students. 
Sarah: how many Student Group Booths would have to be cut
Amalia: last year we had around 70 and we would have to cut at least 5 of them, 
Eric: how many kids wouldn’t be able to trick or treat?
Amalia: that would be 400 children
Motoki: how low would you go? Like the money you ask, 
Amalia: we are asking for the lower end, a bus is 250$
ERIC: how much money would you need to keep the buses and drop the student group. 
Amalia: we can sustain student groups with the number of students that are coming. 
Girish: if there are fewer kids coming, why would you have to cut student groups
Amalia: that number of kids, it wouldn’t make sense to have the booths there, the kids wouldn’t be able to hit them
Michele: is there any way for sights who can pay for their own busses, 
Amalia: most of them are non profit but we have one that does
X: where did you prioritize transport
Girish: you said, fewer kids means less groups?
X: it doesn’t mean that fewer kids would need less kids, cutting students cuts down on NU involvement, were not stating explicitly enough how many students participate in this. 
PRO eric: I understand that were not supposed to take a groups mind into account but these kids would be denied an opportunity to participate in Halloween. 
CON Ana: we don’t fund the Evanston children, that the plain black and white of it. We do fund NCDC, and I have been to project pumpkin and I understand but lets go over the facts that if you have less students come in, you have a choice that you would have to decrease the number of booths, that’s NCDCs choice, but as a board we don’t see that logic, they can still rent the rooms from Norris, its better for circulation, and from a different point, basically financial related, if they really want this funding, we would ask that they fundraise, we allocate funds based on need. We haven’t seen an increase in student volunteers, there are policy that we are trying to adhere to and if there is no change in the event than we cannot change funding and we have already increased transport a bit
PRO: the increase we have seen we are grateful for but we would like to clarify the difference btwn students and children, more children means more students, fundraising, we already put on 4 events a quarter and it was wasting time and resources of our organization. The value of it wasn’t raising enough money. We don’t have the institutional capacity to do so
PRO Amalia: were selling T-shirts which will cover that other costs, which would allow all the kids that came last year. 
PRO Brad: I think its absurd that bettering our image to the community doesn’t impact students .
Tori: point of info we DO fund them
CON Jeremy: I love NCDC I have been to project pumpkin, this is a big increase and the point of this is to benefit directly NU students, this has a SECONDARY benefit to NU students, this is NOT what we should be talking about for this long. 
PRO Mark: if we were supposed to abide EXATLY by the rules, we wouldn’t bring these proposals in front of senate. I think this is a clear case that were disagree with SAFC
CON Girish: you have to think about student in general not your personal opinion, not all students benefit or support this, saying that we should fund a philanthropic thing is not something the SAF is for, this is STILL a 13% increase and if it was any other group we would be having this
Its not a philanthropic event it’s a civil engagement
Community outreach benefits everyone
Girish: you might think that, I think its great that students have access to this but not everyone thinks so. 
(Vote)
(doesn’t pass)
Amalia: find it in your hearts to pass this, it is the same amount every year. 
Girish: we have made all the points we want to make it is a 10% increase which is too much. 
X:What is the role of student groups in this event
Amalia: groups can go set up booths, or be a chaperone, you can also just come attend
Ian: has NCDC ever been awarded anything for the ongoing community service event at the student recognition banquet
Brad: is there any level you would support
Girish: what we have recommended
(PQ)
(passes)
Ani lays down the law on guidelines, “we’re not going to go to another add round. The second pass shall continue until the amendment pool is drained of funds.”
“What am I supposed to do, Girish?” Tensions mount in the room.
Ani goes through groups in the second add round
Motion to revisit A&O
(second)
A&O wants to split their honorarium into two events, one event would be 55,000, and the other would be 22,683.14
Motoki: don’t we have to create a new line for this event?
Ani: precedence says you can just split, were just going to vote to split the honorarium. 
Logan: there is a strong precedent for us to have 2 speakers, this is the split of the honorarium we do spend a little more money on the first one, 
SAFC:
(motion to PQ): split the honorarium
(passes )
Logan: motion to add all production costs and duplicate that into the second event: 4655$ everything you see in line items would be the cost for the first show
Ian: in the past where did that money come from? In the past we tried to shave it off of other production costs,
Girish: if they don’t spend the money it would go back to the SAF
Motoki: what kind of increase was this?
Girish: a lot 
(PQ)
(passes)
(motion to end funding)
passes
Ani: increasing election transparency, I know were all tired
Steven: I wont rehash its in the agenda, basically it will require anyone who is looking to run to declare interest in running to shine a light on pre campaign on the election, its not a punitive thing it is just a re clarification 
to save all of you some hassle, we want to table this for a week
(passed)
Brad: motion to table old business

4/11/14 7:42 PM

Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
Executive Board Reports
• Katie: None
• Abby: None.
• Ani: Read my exec board report. We are working on some really
cool projects. We are selecting the next One Book. It will deal with
stereotypes and identity
• Alex: Read report. Code review. We are going through 10K stuff.
• David: I will be graduating at the end of the year if anyone wants to
take over a twitter account
• Anna: we are putting together a professor/administrator shadowing
day. We are going to test it with ASG, so let me know if you are
interested.
• Kevin: Don’t have anything too exciting, check out our projects. WE
have an housing fair coming up.
• Noah: Over break, I got some new committee members, so I
included some details. We are looking at real time shuttle app
tracking. Also, a web based app contest with students. Sign up to
interview for study abroad app
• Julia: We are bringing back round tables because you all said you
don’t have too much time with administration. Thank you for taking
the survey and passing it along.
• Wes: Read my exec board report.
Special Order: Dr. Julie Payne-Kirchmeier, Assistant Vice President for
Student Auxiliary Services, and Bernie Foster, SafeRide Coordinator
• David: What is the logic behind not picking up from a bar or a place
serving alcohol? The logic seems a little counterintuitive.
• Bernie: SafeRide was created for safe transport. So if you choose to
go out and drink, we suspect you have already found a safe right
home. We also don’t have the right to stop in the street in Evanston
to pick someone up, we are not a cab service. We don’t want to
hurt relations with Evanston.
• Julie: If we also pick up this students and act as a cab company, we
don’t have procedures to follow like they would in cab. If someone
chooses to act like a fool, we aren’t prepared to handle the
situations?

Alex: Is this student run?
Julie: No it is professionally run.
Alex: How will this affect us financially?
Julie: It will be a sink. We will break even. We can also adjust
accordingly if we happens that we are losing money.
Bernie: Also, our biggest issue has been wait time. We have such a
surplus of students waiting, especially in the cold weather like this,
and this could help alleviate the issues we are most currently
facing.
Grace: Yesterday, I wanted to take SafeRide and they said it was
an hour and 10 minutes so I ended up walking. So with this
system, is there a way to tell them that you do not want the ride?
Bernie: You will be able to get in contact with your driver and you
can look up wait times via twitter and Facebook. Our dispatchers
will also be arranged for group pickup and coordination.
Serene: Why is the max 3 passengers?
Bernie: Because statistics say that walking with 3 or more people is
safe walking.
Serene: A lot of times in that situation is that the group calls 2
SafeRides.
Bernie: Then we would look like a cab company and Evanston will
start asking questions.
Serene: And the drivers will still be students?
Bernie: Saferide is all students except for me. And we will continue
to probably have 2 dispatchers.
Julie: You can contact me or Bernie with any further questions. The
main takeaway is that we want to make sure we are doing what the
students want, coming from our initial meeting with ASG 2 years
ago. We may contact you to help out with testing with the new app.

Dinner at Norris- limited options
Long lines at Subway**

David: I would literally rather run again.
Chris: I would like to remove my nomination.
David: I was kidding. Seriously consider running. It is a great way
to quickly immerse yourself in the structure of ASG and what is
going on.
Chris: I would like to re-nominate myself.
Katie: Go down the line and introduce yourself.
Harrison: I am the Kemper senator. I am interested in being on the
election commission. I was apart of the elections last year, and I
think it would be cool to sit on it. And having ran, I think I would
bring a good perspective.
Grace: I am a freshman studying econ and bio. I am apart of the
RHA/RCB caucus. I am on Rules so I think I would be good on this
committee. I would also have fresh eyes on something like this
Kevin: I am the CRVP. I am the only non-Senator up here, so that
is cool. I helped out on the campaign a lot last year. I am a poly sci
major so I am very interested in the election process and how it
works.
Alec: I am the Sargent senator, but I live in Elder. I would like to
get more involved. I don’t’ like taking sides so being impartial
would be cool
Petros: I am the student groups caucus whip. I was on the
committee last year and I am currently on Rules
Nikki: I am the Bobb senator. I am a freshman so I would also have
fresh eyes, and I would like to get more involved.
Dana: I am junior and I am a student groups senator. I served on
the election commission last year, and I really enjoyed it. I like
serving as a resource for the candidates. I enjoyed being able to
explain the guidelines and help out the candidates to avoid
violations.
Chris: I am an RHA/RCB senator. I was on a campaign last year,
and I would like to hear that side. Last year, I saw a lot of things
handled inappropriately

Kevin: I would never want to over apply myself.
Alec: ASG is my biggest commitment. I am also in Wildcats for
Israel
Petros: My only commitment is ASG. Also all my classes are on
Tues and Thurs this quarter.
Nikki: ASG is my biggest commitment. I am on Sustainability
committee.
Dana: I am a Senator, on Rules, I am in a services fraternity, I am
on the exec board of my sorority. I was all of these last year as well
and it wasn’t an issue.
Chris: I am busy as well. I am on PLI, Lend, DM. DM and the new
member class will be over anyway.
Harrison: My biggest time commitment is ASG and I am pledging. I
am also the treasurer for NUSPAN. But I have a time
Alex: Do any of you live off campus?
[Only Dana]
Adam: What would you want to do on this committee, what are you
motivations?
Kevin: I would pick the brain of prior member. I am also very
interested in the democratic process.
Alec: I would also seek the advice of the previous election
commissions.
Petros: I had a great time on the committee last year and I really
like organizing the future of ASG last year. I liked being involved an
moderating the debates.
Nikki: It is one of the most crucial parts of this organization and I
would love to be apart of that.
Dana: I would want to help and foster great and fair campaigns. It
is a great balance of acting as a resource and disciplinary body.
Chris: On a similar not, a great deal was changed in the guidelines
last year. Some problems were also ironed out after last year. I
would also like to make sure those are actually enforced.
Harrison: I was the only person up here that ran last year. There
were some unspoken things that went on last year, and I would
want to bring that to the attention of the EC this year.

Grace: I would want to bring my new perspective this year. And I
would not be biased.
• David: So, last year there was a perceived problem of interest.
Disciplining people you would be working with. I was wondering if
you would state your interest in running for Speaker and
Parliamentarian.
• Alec: I would hope that the candidates would understand our
decisions.
• Petros: as of now, no. And if I did, I would immediately resign.
• Nikki: I have no immediate plans to run. I also agree it would be a
conflict of interest.
• Dana: As of this moment, I am not planning. I, however, don’t
think it is too much of an issue.
• Chris: I have no intentions as of now, but if that changes I would
excuse myself.
• Harrison: No I don’t have the intention of running. Restate rule
• Grace: No
[Election winners: Dana, Kevin, Grace, Harrison, Alec, Nikki, Petros]
General Order: Rules Committee Election
• Katie: Any nominations for the rules committee?
• Lauren: I nominate Adam Roth.
• Adam: I respectfully decline.
• Ani: I nominate Korri.
• Second
• Korri: I accept.
• Korri: Hi I’m majoring in biomedical engineering and I’m interested
in rules because I want to get to know ASG better. I’d be really
excited to take it on as a new learning experience.
• Motion to white ballot
• Second
• Katie: All those in favor. Great!
Old Business: SL1314-07: Hoop for Haiyan
• Ani: Motion to table indefinitely?
• Senator: Second
•

Katie: The event is no longer happening at Northwestern. He is
hosting a similar event in his home town, but it will not be
happening here. All those in favor of tabling indefinitely? Great.
Old Business: SL1314-09: Body Acceptance Week Speaker (B.A.W.S.)
• Ani: It’s a really cool event and they are doing better and better
things every year. This year there will be yoga and nutrition
sessions and a keynote speaker. This bill is asking for $200 for the
keynote speaker and it’s a cool way for ASG to continue it’s Free
Your Mind initiative and support our partners in the administration.
• Katie: 10 min for questions.
• Lauren: Are you asking for money because it’s needed or because
we’re supporting it?
• Ani: Funding is coming from a lot of places and they have not yet
signed the contract. Could they get it elsewhere? Yes, but that
money couldn’t go to something else.
• Katie: Seeing no further questions, we’ll move onto debate.
• Motion to previous question.
• Katie: Seeing no objections, all those in favor please say aye.
Great, that passes. $200 for body acceptance week.
Old Business: SL1314-10: Reducing Bureaucracy, One Position at a Time
• Alex: This legislation is to escalate the AVPs to VP level and
eliminate the bureaucracy that we had before. We believe that
there is a significant amount of overlap with what they do in other
areas of ASG besides student life. With them being part of the
cabinet it makes the selection process streamline. It also gives
them more legitimacy because they don’t have to explain
themselves.
• Senator: ???
• Alex: We have been treating them like VPs. So in practice this
wouldn’t change anything but there titles.
• Katie: Any other questions?
• Alex: This may be outside of scope of the bill. But we have a lot of
VPs don’t we?
• Alex: I think it adequately covers the aspects of campus.
• Petros: what about in comparison to other COPHE schools?
•

Alex: We have more, but I think we are more effective. It is not
really a fair comparison.
• Katie: Okay, we are moving to debate.
• Ani: motion to amend.
• Alex: I sent you the amendment. [to Katie] It changes the wording
of SustainNU to Office of Sustainability, but mostly regarding the
Code. WE are also more explicit then in what they cover in terms of
sustainability. [Katie reads amendment changes.] We pretty much
just made it more explicit. We also matched it for AVP for D&I.
• Katie: Any questions? Okay, then we would vote as a whole on the
amendment. All in favor? All opposed? All abstaining?
[amendment passes]
• Senator: Motion to PQ
• Katie: any objections. Okay we will move to a vote.
[vote passes]
New Business: SL1314-11: Code Changes? What Code Changes?
• Alex: Over the summer, we looked at the Code and various things
we want to change. It is mostly broken down into 3 parts. We
added information for the alternate process, added good faith for
senators applying to committees, saying VPs and AVPs can’t be
senators or caucus whips, some inconsistencies with the
Constitutions.
• Mark: I was curious about the in good faith. What does that mean?
• Ani: Not all senators have to apply to be on a committee, so in past
years many senators have not taken the application seriously. So
adding in good faith means that they need to take the application
process seriously.
• Alex: We also clarified the interactions between CR committee and
off-campus. We set a timeline for the student groups apportionment
committee and some details about how it works. Also, we clarified
the student athletic senator seat. We added that Speaker can
recommend exec members for censure during Senate. We clarified
with senior members on serving on selection committee and what
“the most senior” actually means. Appointments to university
committees were more centralized. We clarified the cabinet
•

selection process when the Chief of Staff is running. Also “closed
committee” for the cabinet selection process was defined.
• Ani: However, the Senate has the tool that they can choose to
make the process completely open.
• Alex: We also created a process if someone is not confirmed for the
Cabinet. Sorry this is a lot. This also needs to be confirmed by 2/3
of Senate.
• Ani: We have never had an RHA or RCB liaison. So we made the
caucus whip of RHA/RCB the liaison. We also adjusted some
inconsistencies. We also reexamined the ad-hoc committees, how
they were formed, what they are accountable for. Our advisors
would also be on the judicial board with the Chief of Justice, which
is another part of the Parliamentarian’s role.
• Alex: This is the structural stuff. We want to append some of the
documents we have lying around to the end of the Code. We would
also moved the committee outlines to after the VPs are defined. WE
also created a new title for all the committees and commissions. We
now have so many standing, working, university and other
committees to make them more defined. We also switched “dorm”
to “residential.” We also restructured the VP names to match the
universities.
• Alex: Of these decisions, what was the most controversial when
going through them?
• Alex: I think the one that took the most thought was the Cabinet
selection committee.
• Ani: There was a lot of “what-if” situations that we has to deal with.
The closed committee aspect was for the privacy of the candidates
and took some thought.
• Katie: Any further questions? Okay this will be Old Business next
week.
New Business: SL1314-12: Mega-Shabbat
• Adam: I am not on Mega-Shabbat, but I am here to introduce it for
my friend who is co-chair. I will be reading a blurb that he
provided. GET BLURB FROM ADAM.
• Katie: Any questions? The author isn’t here.
• Senator: When is the

Sarah: The bill said a $200 donation, but the speech said $200 and
$75 for publicity?
• Katie: That would have to be an amendment next week.
• Jamie: It is funded through Hillel, but it normally gets publicity
funding through ASG in its standard tiered amount.
Good of the Order & Announcements
• Abby: Please
• Jamie: PA applications go live tomorrow. Yay! Apply!

Executive Board Reports
• Ani: We were at the University of Minnesota for Big 10 conference.
Talked a lot about issues that impact students. Also check out the
Playbook. It is 100s of projects across all the committees. Let us
know if anything is missing or needs elaborating.
o Kevin: To follow up on that, we are going to continue doing
lobbying work like that. We are in the Spring going to Capitol
Hill.
• Alex: Just look at my report.
Student Group Spotlight: Wildcat Welcome
Special Order: Todd Adams, Associate Vice President and Dean of Students
• Jane: How do you see it affecting student life day-to-day at
Northwestern?
• Todd: I think it begins right now. It means we need to get out the
word of what the changes are in the policy and talk about what
“consent” actually means. Much like any other policy at
Northwestern, it does not seem applicable to any student until an
situation arises. I am asking you all to not let it get that far. I am
asking you all to start having the discussion now. And not write it
legalistically, but I wanted this policy to be written in a way for all
of us to talk about this topic. This policy was made to implore you
all to go out and talk about this topic. The Topic 9 group is here to
talk about the policy as well. Sexual misconduct is the most underrepresented misconduct on college campus.
• Alex: Are there new avenues for students to report misconduct?
• Todd: At the beginning of the year, ASG actually helped us launch
NU Help that many students have reported misconducts online.
Also, the Northwestern police is here to report issues. The Topic 9
website is also available. So we have many avenues available to
report these problems. So we want people to know we don’t just
have this policy, but we want people to report these issues. Please
facilitate the conversations.

Katie: Kevin, Harrison, and Petros have stepped down from the
Election Commission. Dana is our Commissioner
Senator: Shuyao
Harrison: Jonathan Campbell
Senator: Lauren Thomas
Mark: Mark Silberg
[all seconded and accepted]
Shuyao: I am a junior. I think this job would fit me really well. I am
a CA right now and I currently plan a lot of programs and I work for
the school so I understand the students. I also like elections and
would love to help supervise and help people.
Jonathan: I am a sophomore in Weinberg. Last year when I
attended the debate, I noticed everyone involved was in ASG. And I
think a new and outside perspective and input is really important to
obtain a wider outreach.
Lauren: I am a freshman in Weinberg. I would love to get involved
in the election process but not with a campaign. And because I am
a freshman, I don’t have too many relations formed within ASG so I
will not have a conflict of interest and I have a fresh take.
Mark: I am a senior in Weinberg. I have seen 3 elections in all their
glory and I think I have the perspective to make sure that
Jonathon: I was not involved in any campaign last year. I supported
a member in my fraternity-Aaron
Lauren: No involvement.
Mark: I have never been apart of campaign but I have given
endorsements.
Shuyao: No.
Dana: What are your time commitments for the rest of this quarter
and the beginning of next?
Lauren: Within ASG, I am involved in PLI, Academics committee,
and Senate and I am involved in some other things in campus.
Mark: I am graduating at the end of this quarter, so many of my
responsibilities are ending. I will be starting a job in the spring, but
I will dedicate my heart and soul to this campaign.
Shuyao: I have my CA duties but it is not too much of an issue. I
also join the Karate club every once in a while.

Jonathon: I am involved on campus, but I will have time for this. It
is just 2 weeks of the quarter.
[Election Winners: Mark, Shuyao, Lauren]
Old Business: SL1314-11: Code Changes? What Code Changes?
• Alex: I guess there’s not much else to say that wasn’t said last
week. These are just changes that should have been made already
and have not been updated.
• Ani: We learn every year why it’s important to have a flexible code.
• Harrison: Motion to previous question.
• Katie: Seeing no objections, all those in favor. Fabulous, that
passes unanimously.
[vote passes unanimously]
Old Business: SL1314-12: Mega-Shabbat
• Motion to move to the end of the agenda.
• Katie: We need 2/3.
• Katie: Great, we’ll move that down.
• Mia: Mega-Shabbat is a campus wide Shabbat dinner that takes
place in Alison dining hall. We have held it for the past 3 years. We
are looking to expand it further by adding family style food and
deeper table discussions. The event will happen either way, but we
would like to see student group support. We have received money
current FROM?????
• Isaac: did you receive money from the Project Pool in the past?
• Mia: yes the same amount
• Senator: who else have you gotten money from that is not Jewish
affiliated?
• Mia: The office of the president, the office of the provost, LOOK UP
• Eliza: Have you considered a larger venue.
• Mia: yes we have sold out in the past and sold out this year, but
that would be something that would be explored in later year..
There are 400 students signed up current.
• Isaac: What is your budget for the event?
• Mia: We have a private donor who is wiling to match our efforts. So
about $10,000.
• Isaac: so is someone matching the $200 or is someone else giving
it if we don’t.
•

Mia: Someone will match the $200. We are not in dire need for the
money, but we would love to see student group support.
• Katie: So we will move into debate period.
• Isaac: They have a huge budget and this is a drop in the bucket
and $200 could go much further in other groups.
• Jane: Motion to amend to change $200 to $150.
• Alex: Object. What is the difference, there is no budgetary
difference?
• Harrison: I agree that it is not a huge difference, but I think that it
is fine that it is lowered because we are showing support but saving
some money in the pool.
• Petros: I am going to echo Alex and say that it is not that much of
a difference.
• Noah: I think there are 50 reasons not to give the extra money.
• Alex: I think if you think 50 makes a difference, you should not be
voting in favor at all.
• Ani: I am sorry if I came across as sarcastic. But I think this is
more of a gesture of support, and Mega-Shabbat impacts and
touches such a large group of students on this campus. The money
amount is more just about what we feel comfortable giving.
• Katie: So we are in line to vote.
• [Division-22, 10, 1 amendment passes]
• Alex: Previous question
• Senator: 2nd
[vote passes]
New Business: SL1314-13: Discover Islam Week: The Many Faces of
Feminism
• Discover Islam Week is an annual Northwestern tradition. We
usually have a week of exciting events and previous topics we’ve
had have been civic engagement in the US, Guantanamo Bay, etc.
This year it will be Feb 24th – 28th. We have come to request
additional funding for two main reasons. The first is that we want to
better the quality of our events. We usually have two SAF funded
and two non-funded. Second, we want to be able to collaborate
with non-cultural groups and bridge that gap. Specifically, we are
requesting funds for a fireside to shed light on religion and the role
•

of women and how they are sometimes at odds. Our speaker’s bio
is in the legislation and we are trying to get her to make our event
of a high caliber. We have raised $1500 already and are currently
applying to cosponsor with the chaplain’s office. We are asking for
$1500 from the Senate Project Pool.
• Katie: Questions?
• Alex: You said this event has happened before? Why do you need
ASG funding?
• PARS: We want improve the caliber of this event we could use the
extra funding.
• Isaac: How many people think will attend?
• PARS: 60 or 70
• ????
• PARS: PHA, MGSC, and some other non cultural groups.
• Dillon: Why didn’t you come try to seek funds during our fall
amendment pool?
• PARS: I don’t really understand. This is newer addition to the event
so we came to Senate to get the money to fund it.
New Business: SL1314-14: Polish Cultural Night
• Alex: PASA is looking to expand their reach on campus and use
ASG funds to create a larger event. I am helping him out, so once
the actual author comes he can speak more to the details.
• Jane: Motion to move this bill to after the Shuttle Resolution.
• Senator: 2nd
[Vote passes]
• Peter: Hi, sorry I am a little late. Polish cultural night is an event
that PASA puts on campus each year in the winter. IN following
with PASA’s growth over the past year, we want to expand Polish
cultural night. We have had food and dancing and discussion that
probably was not as authentic as it could have been. This year we
want to tie it to Polasky day and make it bigger. We want to bring
in a dance group, a speaker and food. We really would like to see
these plans happen, but we need the funds.
• Alex: Has this event been going on for a while?
• Peter: I have only been able to track this event for the past 4
years.

Alex: and have you used ASG funding?
Peter: I believe just the SAFC funding.
Jane: How do you plan on attracting a larger community to come.
Peter: We are confident with our expansion and stronger visibility
that we will be able draw a larger audience.
• Jacob: What food are you looking to bring in?
• Peter: We are getting a deli to provide sandwiches, pastries and
dumplings.
• Senator: How much are you asking for again?
• Peter: Due to the two groups coming and out, so in total $650.
• Senator: How much is left in the Pool?
• Alex: $10,000, but that shouldn’t matter. You should approach each
event on its merit.
• Ronak: How many people have attended in the past?
• Peter: My freshman year about 30 people showed up.
New Business: SR1314-02: Increased Undergraduate Shuttle Services
• Hailey: this resolution is pretty self-explanatory. The transportation
office came to us wanted ASG support to show a student need to
expand the shuttle services. They do not have money to support
the need, and ASG support would help.
• Isaac: There are 2 current shuttles that run during the day, Ryan
Field and the intercampus. Both don’t cater to moving the
undergraduate students. The concept is to get more shuttles to
coordinate the 50 and hour when students are actually trying to run
in between classes.
• Petros: Would this help? Or would it overcrowd the shuttles
already?
• Hailey: Hopefully by adding more shuttles, it wouldn’t matter????
LOOK THIS UP.
• Petros: Would this cause traffic congestion to Evanston?
• Hailey: We are not far enough along to discuss that yet, but it
would be only 1 or 2 more additional day shuttles.
• Jane: would it be less redundant to just run the Evanston loop?
• Hailey: That has definitely been a discussed possibility. But the
transportation office said list whatever would be the best and most
supported plan by students.
•
•
•
•

Alex: when would we see this actually take place if it happens?
Isaac: This is in the budget for the fiscal year of 2015. Continue
push by students would help get it done and passed as soon as
possible.
• Alex: Would it help to move this to old business tonight?
• Ani: It wouldn’t hurt.
[motion passes]
• Senator: PQ

Call to Order and Roll Call
Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
Executive Board Reports
• Katie: Go to caucus.
• Abby: Keep Katie and me in the loop as well on attendance in
caucus.
• Ani: WE are working with the Greek councils to incorporate QPR
into new member training. Ask me questions on mental help.
• Alex: We narrowed down 10K ideas to 60 ideas and we our
crunching numbers. We are also looking at data from the survey.
WE are hoping to have the numbers good to go on Sunday or near
there and then start meeting with admin. I am also working with
Josh McKenzie on Year 1 ideas for freshman.
• David: None
• Anna: We have 3 spots for admin/faculty to follow you around for a
day. Also, we have some spots to test Tap Ride if you want to work
with that.
• Sofia: CTEC pilot in testing. Study Abroad board is launching a new
app. We are working on committee data analysis and other
projects. If you want to know more let me know.
• Kevin: Next week will have more information on project and maybe
guests. Housing Fair is this week. Share the event and tell your
friends-Friday 12-3pm 30 landlords coming. Aldermen coming to
visit.
• Julia: Check out the awesome PR Guide. We are getting great
feedback also from administration. Nominations for wildcat for the
week is starting today. A lot of projects are going on. All
administrators, 35 of them, agreed to do roundtables.
• Sub for Wes: Is working on a lot of projects.
• Thaddeus: No updates for right now.
Special Order: Dr. John Dunkle, Executive Director of CAPS
• [PRESENTATION]
• Jane: is the sports psychologist for just varsity athletes or all
athletes?

o JD: No all athletes. We do have others dedicated to athletes
as well.
• Thaddeus: What is the current demographic makeup of CAPS
faculty? Also, what are resources for low income students after their
allotted sessions run out.
o JD: We have gay lesbian, African America, American Asian,
those who speak Mandarin, Japanese, German, Spanish. We
also have a whole host of diversity in our resource center.
That is something I am always tuned into. Our session limits
are 3. We would like to expand that with more faculty,
however, we will never be able to offer continuous sessions.
We and our case manager, Tiffany Manley, works with
insurance and she works to make sure rates are affordable for
students. We also find access to funds if they are available for
students. We do refer to therapist off campus to those who
have a sliding scale for students. It also depends on the
issues and what expertise we have in-house as well. We also
work with parents a lot.
• Senator: What is the Emotional Intelligence course about?
o JD: There are a lot of studies that correlate emotional
intelligence to relationships, success, leadership. So we have
seen that a lot of students come in intelligent, but not
emotionally so. So it delves into those areas.
General Order: Student Group Assessment Working Group Presentation
• Lauren: Why would groups apply for ASG recognition.
• Tori: you can book for rooms in Norris. There isn’t a whole lot
associated with it. There is an added level of “prestige,” but it
doesn’t mean too much.
• Alex: Can you just add money to B-status groups.
• Tori: They would apply for the first time and because the pool is so
small, you might see that groups apply and don’t use the money.
• Serene: Can you get Northwestern to help cover security costs?
• Tori: A lot of times that is billed into labor and is based on the
number of attendants. It is harder to track though than things like
venues.
General Order: Election Guidelines Presentation

Alex: On non verbal campaigning, if someone hands out something
that is not associated with the campaign, like a personal business
card, is that a violation.
o Dana: I don’t think so, but we would address something like
that as a group.
Isaac: Why do you have two debates on the same day.
o Dana: We shortened the campaign period so those seem like
the days that made most sense.
Ani: Do you see having the debates so early to the start of non
verbal campaigning being an issue of not knowing the candidates?
o Dana: Not
o Mark: It is also on us for people to attend the debates.
Sarah: At what point can you start doing PR about the debates.
o Dana: any time. Just we can’t announce names of candidates
until the petitions are due.
David: Election day is current a Friday. Would you be willing to line
it up with a Wednesday to align it with Senate? I think it would
have better voter turnout and it would align more with campus
news cycles.
o Dana: The timeline is shortened and kept with the same start
date so that we are able to start as soon as we get back. We
could push it back. We can shorten the amount of time to get
signatures.
David: Would you add in that the names on the ballot be
randomized?
o Dana: I think that is already in the guidelines.
o David: Would you make sure that this happens?
o Dana: Yes we will work with Wildcat Connection to best make
sure this happens.
Senator: Why was the length of the campaign shortened.
o Dana: Campaign fatigue and
David: Would you consider previewing the ballot to Senate before
the election?
o Mark: Why?

o David: I think all the candidates would agree that the ballot
was terrible last year, and I think providing feedback would
help with that.
• Harrison: Last week, was verbal campaigning a thing last year too?
And was it a week too? And was petitions apart of that?
o Dana: Yes it was.
• Sarah: I have a question about non-verbal campaigning. It starts
on the 13th?
o Dana: Yes
• David: Would you consider making election violations public?
o Dana: We had a long discussion about this. I personally think
that is a bad idea. It is our job as a commission to figure out
and discuss violations as they come in. And it could be turned
into its own form of bad campaigning.
• Senator: What about exec endorsements?
o Dana: We are bringing it in as legislation formally next week.
• Ani: Can you shorten or combine petition signing?
o Mark: We would take up that time to introduce the candidates
as ASG.
o Dana: I would be open to amendments.
• Katie: If you have a change to propose you can just do it.
• Harrison: Can we make the non-verbal campaigning from the 6th18th?
• David: Can we make this a more formal process through
legislation?
• Alex: Motion to table changes to the guidelines until next week until
legislation is written.
• Isaac: So what is the timeline?
• Katie: This will be presented again next week as legislation and we
will vote on it then.
• Alex: Would you consider having office hours this week?
• Dana: Email me and we can meet.
Old Business: SL1314-13: Discover Islam Week: The Many Faces of

outlets on campus to create strong discussion. We are having a
female professor come in and we have gotten her to lower her
price from $4000 to $2200 but we would still like to ask for $1500.
Our current budget is for the whole week and we are getting $1000
from various fundraising efforts and grants.
Grace: Will you have to take away from events if we didn’t fund the
money?
Speaker: We are looking to make this year’s event better than ever
so it would be difficult.
Jane: Is any funding dependent on ours? Like would us funding help
others fund you?
Author: It would go in our proposals for more money that you are a
sponsor so that might help.
Ani: Are you sure the president’s office will help?
Author: They have donated in the past.
Katie: Okay we are in line for debate. Con speech.
Isaac: I think there is an issue that we are having separating
expanding an event and making sure an event happen. Motion to
amend to change amount to $500.
Petros: Objection
Isaac: This is 1/10th of our project pool, and we shouldn’t give the
money for a new scope of an event that is already happening.
Petros: [pro speech] This is a high profile event on campus that
does reach a lot of people on campus. And this could be a great
event on campus.
Alex: PQ
[amendment fails]
Eliza: [pro speech] We have so many groups come in and ask for
money for new events. And we ask questions that she has
answered and reaching out to so many groups on campus that
could increase turnout. And they negotiated down group.
Lauren: Motion to amend amount to $1000. $500 is too little but
$1000 is too much.
Speaker: We should fund what they are asking for.
Lauren: I would say in light of last week, there are 500 reasons we
should not fund this.

Isaac: The amount was also lowered from $4000 to $2200.
Jamie: I think they are asking for the bare minimum that they can
afford and we should fund this.
Ani: You haven’t even spent half of the pool yet and we shouldn’t
think of how much is left in the pool or how much they are asking
but based on the merit of the event.
Isaac: I don’t think that applies here, we have a budget
Ani: Point of parliamentary procedure, Mega-Shabbat expressed
that they did not have need for the money, it was supplementary?
Abby: Yes, that is true.
Isaac: We have a budget and we should try to weary of that
regardless.
Sarah: We are not a budgeting body and we need to fund based on
merit.
Alex: PQ
o Steven: Objection
o Alex: I think all that needs to be said has been said.
o Steven: withdrawn
Alex: PQ
[amendment fails]
Jane: Motion, “If an excess of $2200 is raised, than that money
would be returned to the project pool.”
Isaac: What if the money is raised for the event as a whole?
Jane: It is money that would be earmarked for the speaker.
Senator: Objection
Jane: So if we are worried about the money in the pool, they can
raise the money it can be returned.
Petros: I don’t think it is up to a student group to return money to
the pool.
Alex: If you don’t want to give them the money just don’t vote on
it.
Senator: I think it is fair to say that if they can raise the money and
don’t need it that the money can go somewhere else.
Mike: I think this will help make the pool more sustainable. I think
we are only going to get more requests from here on out, so I
would like to make sure that the pool is sustainable.

Julia: McSA is raising money for many events for the week, so it
doesn’t make sense for them to give the money back.
• Eliza: I think groups giving back money is wrong. DM was a special
case. If we are choosing to fund an event, that is that.
• Mike: We want to promote a sustainable project pool. And this
event is great, but we are encouraging a complete deflation of the
pool. If you are not sure how much money you have because you
have money pending, we should get the money back.
• Senator: [to author] When money is raised, is it for a certain event
or for the week as a whole?
o Author: It is usually for all the events for the week.
• Serene: [con on amendment] They have reached out to
departments that they do every year. So they are not increasing
the amount, just the amount that they normally get. They are
trying to expand the event.
• Parag: It is not feasible for us to also have them track where
donations are going to.
• Alex: PQ
• Jane: Amendment withdrawn.
• Sarah: It is in the code with the way funding works.
• Katie: Okay we are line for a con speech.
• Isaac: For the future, we are at the number not because we are
great budgeters, but because we have doubled the amount. We
need to be more conservative with our spending.
• Lauren: There is a limited amount of money in the pool and a lot of
need for students for money for events, so we need to be careful on
how we spend the money.
• Katie: Okay we are out of time. We are moving to a vote.
[vote passes]
Old Business: SL1314-14: Polish Cultural Night
• Peter: I am PASA president and it has grown quite a bit on campus.
We have done a lot of events and collaborations not only with
students, but also in Chicago. We have a lot of excited work going
on internally. In the past, this event is held during the week at
Norris with one performance. I would like to expand this event to
show how we have grown as a group. I want to hold it on Polasky

weekend to honor him. Many different performers are lined up to
come for the event and food will be provided during intermission.
The venue cost has been covered and other costs, but we are
asking for $650 for both performances
Parag: Have you approached any other department for support?
Peter: Career services but it is not in their budget.
Senator: Why the two performances?
Peter: the first is to show how young people born in America are
still proud of their culture and the other to express for a certain
ethnic group.
Senator: Attendance?
Peter: About 70
Senator: Can you have just one group not both?
Peter: They highlighted different needs.
Mike: Attendance in the past?
Peter: About 30 but we expect more because of the space and its
not on a week night.
Sarah: So if we fund $400 it would cover the dancing but we just
wouldn’t have a second performance?
Peter: Yes, I would just try to negotiate with them.
Mike: When is the event? And what PR efforts are you taking?
Peter: March 1st and we are using past PR material and efforts to
reach out to various Polish groups around Chicago as well as on
campus.
Mike: Why did you reach out to ASG?
Peter: Because the project pool exists for this purpose.
Serene: How are budgeting for PR?
Peter: Flyers aren’t that much money.
Katie: We are in line for debate.
Parag: Motion to amend to $400 to pay just for the dance group.
Senator: Objection
Parag: I think this is a great event, and I think you haven’t
exhausted your options to get money elsewhere.
Serene: I don’t think we are in line to mess with the line up of the
event. We don’t really know the Polish culture and what is okay to
cut.

Peter: WE have already agreed to certain amounts with the groups,
and I don’t want to have to go back and renegotiate due to the
professionalism of the group.
• Steven: We have the discretion to fund what we want on these
sorts of issues.
• Sofia: As a B-status group, this goes along with what Tori
expressed earlier. This shows our inefficiencies as a group of how
our funding works and we should fund something like this. The
nature of this example shows that the SAF was not able to fund the
whole event.
• Alex: PQ
[Division: 11, 22, 1 amendment fails]
• Senator: PQ
[vote passes]
New Business: SL1314-15: Ubu Roi Request
• Amy: I’m Amy and a junior. I am working on Ubu Roi which is the
debut performance of a new group Beg to Differ. The group is
comprised of only non-theater majors. The week is going up in a
week and a half. We are requesting $500 for the production.
• Adam: How long has your group been meeting?
• Amy: It began in the spring.
• Alex: Do you have a SOFO account?
• Amy: No we don’t because we are not University recognized.
• Alex: So how do you work with money?
• Amy: Right now it is a personal account. We would like to be a
university recognized group and ASG recognized but that hasn’t
happened yet.
• Chris: Can we allocate money to a group if they don’t have a SOFO
account.
• Ani: Yes we technically can.
• Ani: Can you even book the great room?
• Natalie: No unless you have insurance.
• Serene: Have you started the process to become T-status?
• Amy: not to my knowledge.
• Mike: What if I was a theater major and wanted to be in the
production?
•

Amy: We are working on that right now with the board. We don’t
want to exclude anyone.
• Senator: why haven’t you become university recognized?
• Amy: the whole theater vs. non-theater became a question, but we
are still working on it. We booked Jones as an individual.
Good of the Order & Announcements
• Ani: Thank you for funding the events today. We doubled the
money to help go around the flaws that Sofia mentioned earlier. By
funding things and using the money, we can go to the
administration and our own funding process.
• Parag: SASA show this Friday.
• Jenny: Pi Phi and SAE is having a food philanthropy at SAE. $5
wristbands and $7 at door.
• Sarah: DG lounge.
• Jamie: AEPi and Alpha Chi is hosting a food philanthropy. Proceeds
go to DM. $5 wristbands
• Kevin: Housing fair
• Anna: Let me know if you want to pilot Tap Ride or have faculty
follow you around.

ASG Senate Meeting
05 January 2011
Northwestern Room
7:00pm
	•	Call to Order and Roll Call
	•	Approval of the Journal
	•	Approved
	•	Executive Board Reports
	•	Gabby: ASG is hosting interNU tomorrow.  Basically it’s an event with UCS.  They’re bringing out their whole crew to Norris tomorrow.  It’s a way to get advice about internships, resumes, cover letters.
	•	Liz: The Winter Activities Fair will be Thursday the 20th.  If you’re a student group senator and your group hasn’t signed up yet, shoot me an email.
	•	Claire: Two things.  First we created the Senate representation committee.  If you’re interested in being a part of this, email Claire.  Next.  Every year, all schools from the Big Ten get together and have a student government retreat.  It’s next weekend—we leave Friday afternoon, and we’ll get back Sunday morning.  Email Claire before Friday if you’re interested
	•	Matt: At the start of every quarter we take a look at what we’ve done last quarter.  So this is just an overview of what we accomplished.  [power point].  Trustee engagement, SOFO evaluation, cell phone reception, Book Swap, new NU-Link, external budget guide, President’s video address, Tailgate, etc.  The point of this is to let you and students know what we’re capable of.   We can provide solutions to problems faced by students.
	•	Tyris: Just wanted to formally thank Wilson and Francis for stepping in last quarter.  And thanks to everyone for helping with that transition.  Has a few ideas for next quarter.  First, wants to create senator profile.  Also wants to work on archiving so that you can all look back on past legislation for reference.
	•	Claire: So we’re going to be mixing up Senate a little bit today.  We want to get feedback from you all—first we’ll be talking about UBPC proposals.  Next, we’ll be looking at ideas for the Strategic Plan.  This will be looking forward in the long run.  This is your chance to speak up.
	•	Anil: Is the chair of the UBPC.  Thanks for letting us come here to let us talk to you.  Every year we go to the president, the provost, and the administration, to let them know what students want.  We just want to get some feedback from you today about the things that you and your constituents feel are important.  Also, just letting you know that anything you say will be held in confidence—you won’t be identified in any way for ideas that you express in these focus groups.
	•	Special Order: Associate Director for Student Involvement
	•	Special Order: UBPC Breakout Session
	•	Break into groups
	•	Group I
	•	The thing that we decided that we would most like to fund is a 3rd space for students.  Things that it would be a good way to move the social scene more to campus.
	•	Group 2
	•	We wanted to fund the most was digitizing SOFO.  Basically it would just help student groups streamline their process.  SOFO is really behind technology-wise.  It would be extremely beneficial for board transitions to be able to look back on past ledgers and see the history of transactions.
	•	Another thing we wanted to focus on is increasing the Environmental Science program.  The program here is really lacking.  There are actually a number of people who have transferred because of our lack of an Environmental Science program.  Northwestern is first and foremost an academic institution.
	•	Group 3
	•	We decided to mostly focus on cell phone reception and mail room issues.
	•	Anil: thanks so much!  And please take our online survey
	•	Special Order: Strategic Plan Breakout Session
	•	Claire: This is just a great opportunity to look further ahead in the future
	•	Differentiate, innovate, empower, engage.
	•	Group 1: Differentiate
	•	Talked about moving student life to the center of campus.  Really increasing connectivity.
	•	Group 2: Innovate
	•	Academics.  Especially environmental studies.
	•	More of a hands-on learning experience.  SESP has more discussion-based and intimate classes.
	•	Advising: in WCAS there really is no follow-up with this.
	•	Video lectures
	•	Greater focus on undergrads.
	•	Traditional learning.  Just getting more classes, a broader array of classes.
	•	Transfer credits are rigid, maybe we could improve this.
	•	Group 3: Empower
	•	Lack of traditions.
	•	Updating the RC and RHA system.  We’re behind in our integration of faculty with students.
	•	Increasing community in residence halls.
	•	Increase collaboration of student groups.
	•	Centralized place where student groups can publish events.
	•	Increasing publicity and availability of pre-wildcat week activities.
	•	“shared experiences” 
	•	Group 4: Engage
	•	Always came back to diversity.
	•	Breaking down the North/South campus divide.  Making ourselves a more cohesive community.
	•	General Order: ASB Financial Misconduct
	•	Emma: SAFC voted to give ASB a financial misconduct for failure to hold an event they were funded for last winter.  This just means that they must have more oversight from the SAFC.  We ask that ASB take minutes during their audit trail meetings.  Also they will be helped with their transition process.
	•	Q: Where does that unused money go?
	•	A: It rolls back into the SAF
	•	Good of the Order and Announcements
	•	Aaron: Pick up some of these A&O posters!
	•	Amalia: Next Tuesday is the MLK job fair.  12-4 here.  Peace Corp is coming, CIA is coming.  Just drop by.
	•	Rick: There is an ice-rink.  We think it’ll be ready to go by the end of the week.  Join us at 5pm on Friday for ribbon-cutting.

o Abby: None
o David: Important announce, especially for Student group
senators. The apportionment committee for allocating student
groups are live tonight. The process will work the same, minus
one caveat. If you are currently a student group senator, you
much reapply. If you are reapplying, you will have a separate
application. Based upon those applications and if you have been
an exemplary senator, you might not have to come in for an
interview. Lots of internal reform bills today! Yay, everyone’s
favorite.
o Anna: Student Admin shadow happening, called a day in the life.
IT will be happening in 2 weeks. We are sill gathering some
admin. There will be a pre and post meeting about the

cramming the programming into just one week this week. Norris
will also be open until 3am this quarter, because there is a drop
off after this usual.

should. We are helping promoting student athlete talent show,
we are doing PR.
o Chan: Working on some bike projects regarding creating more
bike lanes, as well as bike sharing and repair.
Special Order: Community Engagement Grant Presentation
o Isaac: This is the community engagement grant that will be live
tonight. It was put together last year. It goes to a group of
students or student groups for a project to help improve off
campus efforts. It is an image thing to improve our relations
with Evanston. The project is $500 to be used off campus. We
are hoping to have a strong push for just students to apply, not
just student groups. Please talk with your friends, with you
students, and with your student groups about applying. There
will be a committee to select the North.
Old Business: SL1314-15: Ubu Roi Request
o Motion to move request after election.
o Alex: Since you don't have a SOFO account, where would the
money go?
o Beg to Differ (BTD): We are already in works to
o Alex: Who is your treasurer?
o BTD: Mary Peoples. She is also a producer on the show.
o Chris: Ani and Alex, is there precedence that we have given
money to not a SOFO account.
o Alex: Yes, like with therapy dogs, it is just university
recommended.
o Petros: if you don't get this money, will it still happen?
o Amy: Yes
o BTD: there is a stipulation that if we get more money than the
production will cost, it will go to future BTD productions. We are
also not charging for tickets
o Petros: So this money could go to future BTD productions?

o BTD: Yes technically if we over raise.
o Lauren: Too specific of focus to gain university recognition?
o BTD: We are working with CSI to expand our focus to make sure
that is not an issue.
o Isaac: So if you don't get this money will you have to charge for
tickets.
o Amy: No, but we might have a suggested donation box.
o Grace: What sort of fundraising have you done.
o Amy: Asking money from friends and family mostly.
o Eliza: The production will go on regardless, so if you get this
$500 it will cover costs you have overcompensated for?
o Amy: We have been conservative in our spending, but it could
cover some extras.
o BTD: This would also help with reimbursing students have
o Jenny: What about the grant you applied for through Comm?
o Amy: I haven't heard from them yet
o Jenny: Where has the budget come from?
o Amy: A lot out of pocket and family and friend donation.
o Jenny: Was that out of pocket money, donations or loans?
o Amy: People would be reimbursed for their own spending.
o Alex: We cannot just give you money, so can we give you
receipts that we can reimburse for up to $500. Or we can cut
them a check on your behalf.
o BTD: we have done a great job and keeping track and we have
receipts.
o Isaac: What sort of sustainable funding are you looking for.
o BTD: We do want to become recognized. We also hope that once
we have our inaugural show that funding would be more
regulatory.
o Isaac: How much are you and your members in debt out of
pocket?
o Amy: About $500
o Katie: Con speech
o Petros: This seems like a great cause, but giving a money to a
group without a SOFO account seems if-y. And the show will go
on regardless.

•

o Alex: As I said last week, you don't need to be University
recognized to get a SOFO account. And that makes me
o BTD: we are in the process of getting a SOFO account. But
because of our recent rebranding to become a less "exclusive
group" (CSI's wording) has delayed our process.
o Natalie: You need to recognized by someone on campus and you
need to be on Wildcat Connection to get a SOFO account.
o Alex: don't let logistics of reimbursement judge your vote.
Please don't consider it. I will deal with it. So please look at the
merit of the event.
o Eliza: This seems like a great event, but this seems like back
tracking. It seems like we are reimbursing what is already there.
I would love to see what comes of this show, and then consider
funding.
o Katie: Pro speech
o Chris: Yes, they have not gone along the normal trajectory, but
we should not discredit or not think their event is not
meritorious. They have such a passion and I am confident that
they will succeed and have further productions.
o Alex: Chris changed my mind.
o Chris: Motion to amend, can we add something about them
coming back to Senate to see how the production went. "Have
Beg to Differ come in for a Student Spotlight within 3 weeks
following the production of Ubu Roi."
o Senator: PQ

Old Business: SL1314-16: Making Elections Less Awful
o David: The biggest change is to shorten the campaign period
overall. There are 3 campaign period. The first we are in right
now in which that potential candidates can talk with student
group leaders or potential campaign personnel to either join the
team or receive feedback. Next is also another campaign period,

the petition and signature gathering process. The next campaign
period is the verbal campaigning period where you can tell
people you are running but there are no written documents
saying you are running. Finally, is the non campaign period that
we all know and love. Shorten petition. Also, we should make
violations public. People have the right to know.
Petros: didn’t the vote end on a weekday last year?
David: I don’t count Friday as a weekend. I think we will have
better voter turnout. And starting the election at 9pm people will
be able to have a kickoff event and candidates need sleep tool
Harrison: Do you really think that having it end on a Wednesday
will help?
David: This is just based off of intuition but based upon what I
have noticed with Facebook posts and participation on surveys,
events, etc.
Lauren: What about if there is not a consequence given?
David: Only if the commission deems a violation as a true
violation, then it will be posted online. Also, the. I think it is
more responsible just let people know the violation.
Chris: what about the prep time allowed previously in the verbal
campaigning period?
David: A good candidate should be ready by then.
Petros: DO you think that publishing violations will hurt
impartiality?
David: The Election Commission’s job should be impartial.
Publicizing violations will not make the commission to take sides,
but actually hold them to a greater power and hold them and the
candidates more accountable.
Chris: Would you want the names involved given?
David: Ideally it would go under just the candidate team’s name.
It should fall on the candidate. If X freshman makes a mistake,
the candidate should ideally take responsibility.
Dana: Do you think publicizing the violations would be a
detriment to the candidate that wins?

o David: If someone breaks that rules, then people should no. It
seems like it is in bad faith not to acknowledge the violations
made by the winners.
o Alex: What is going to happen when people are in the same area
fighting for signatures in 2 days?
o David: There is not limit to the number of petitions you can sign
and a signature is a promise to vote.
o Alex: So do you just see candidates lining up in a row to get
people to sign petitions?
o David: If people want to do that, more power to them. There are
greater
o Alex: What about extenuating circumstances?
o David: The Election Commission will have to examine that to sort
it out.
[End of question period]
Alex: Motion to amend to extend the petition period one more
day, so on the fourth day. And additionally, make the petitions
available at 12:01am on Monday.
David: So you would have 3.5 instead of 2.5 days.
Alex: I think that it will help people get there team together and
prepare.
Dana: So would that shorten the campaign period?
Alex: I didn’t’ think about that, we would have to extend it.
David: I would rather have the non-verbal campaign period
shorten. Can someone object?
Senator: Object.
David: I really don’t have sympathy for candidates that
Harrison: Also, there are so many debates and pieces of the
election that must be crammed into a week, and we really can’t
shorten the election period.
Katie: WE are in line for a con.
Petros: I think we can shorten the campaign period. I think campus
will like a shorten election. Also, a petition period should be longer
to not bar people from running.
Senator: PQ
[Division:23, 9, 2 amendment fails]

Chris: Motion to amend, under article v. change it to read “the
commission should make public all CONFIRMED violations.” Also the
candidate shall not make public any names anyone’s name except
the candidates regarding a violation.”
• David: That’s a friendly amendment
• Katie: Would you like to elaborate.
• Chris: I will succeed my time.
• Mark: What do you mean by confirmed violation.
• Chris: I just want to clarify between the alleged violation and
confirmed violations.
• Senator: Objection
• Steven: POI: If it is a friendly amendment by the author, should it
go in?
• Katie: No we don’t follow that rule here. Con speech?
• Alec: I think there is a difference between a candidate knowingly
committing a violation and someone on their campaign doing it by
accident and it should appear differently.
• Senator: Motion to divide question.
• Katie: Okay we will know go into debate about the word
“confirmed.”
• Senator: PQ
[amendment passes]
• Katie: We will now go to the next sentence. Pro speech?
• Chris: I just think it will help clarify
[division 16, 18, 0 amendment fails]

• Alex: PQ
• Katie: any objections. Okay we will move to a vote.

Old Business: SL1314-17: Election Guidelines Revision Suggestions
o Dana: More election revisions that will not overlap with the last
legislation. In section III, in the pre-campaigning period that the
commission will tell all student group leaders the candidates
intent to run. That is impossible so we just put in that the
commission must be told the candidates. Also we put in only
undergraduate students for the current academic year can

endorse. Faculty, staff, alumni, and graduate students can’t
endorse. Also current exec members can’t endorse and the
election commission can’t endorse
o Ani: Can we change putting together to recruiting and he and
she to they.
o Korri: what would be the consequence if a candidate was
endorsed by a grad student and didn’t know or ask to be?
o Dana: That would be at the discretion of the commission
o Mark: It is only if the candidate publicizes it that
o Isaac: are you concerned by banning exec endorsements would
be pushed underground even further with how they push their
opinion.
o Kevin: So mark, would that apply to exec member endorsements
as well?
o Mark: Yes, what they do on their own time is their own
prerogative.
o Chris: What about students who graduate not in spring quarter.
o Dana: That encompasses that.
o Katie: We would move to a vote.
o Dana: Motion to divide everything. I think we should go down a
line and talk about each thing.
o Katie: Okay, so we are going to look just at section III, precampaigning period, only.
o Ani: PQ
o Senator: 2nd
o Grace: Motion to amend.
o Ani: Withdrawn.
Grace: There is a grammatical error with using candidate and they.
Petros: It is okay in modern American literature.
Grace: Withdrawn.
Isaac: I would like to ad something to campaign resources to
section V.
Katie: We are not in line for that right now.
Isaac: If we are dividing it up, we will never vote on this part.
Katie: Good point.
Dana: We can do it first.

Isaac: Okay I will share you on it now. Essentially, it lists how you
allocate a certain amount of money to each candidate and I would
like to add that all ASG resources, monetary or otherwise, may not
be used.
David: Can we put in that the all the candidates don’t need to
approve it?
Isaac: Yeah that’s friendly.
Senator: 2nd

Chris: Can we also include digital as a resource, for like individual
email addresses?
Senator: PQ
Senator: 2nd
[vote passes]
Katie: Okay we are back to section III.
Chris: Can I do my amendment now, it is a new clause.
Katie: Yeah that’s fine.
Chris: So something I thought was cool that other schools do at the
Big Ten Conference. Candidates could run under a candidate name.
So I would like to amend for the candidates be able to submit a
name to run under with approval of the commission. I think it
would provide an added level of knowing what they are about.
There are also a couple caveats. They can’t relate to the previous 4
years of election. It also must be approved by the commission.
Dana: would they be required to do it?
Chris: No it is just an option.
Katie: Con speech?
Petros: I don’t see a point for this. Some people may do this and
others may not who are less creative or something. I also just don’t
see a need for this. The platform should speak more than a catchy
name.
Harrison: We also just don’t know the implications of this and how
it might play out. We would need time to think about this.
Katie: Pro speech
Alex: I think students would like this and that is what an
amendment is for. To be voted on that night.

system. That is something I worry about and it also just seems
stupid to me.
Katie: Pro speech
Isaac: As a freshman I don’t have any memory of previous
candidates, and I really don’t think that this will be an issue. And I
am not worried about parties being formed.
Chris: This is something a lot of schools
Katie: Con speech.
Korri: I am worried that uninformed students may just vote based
on a name and might skew the voting as a whole.
Petros: There is constitutional memory and Daily articles about
previous names and it may benefit the candidate undeservingly.
Katie: Pro speech
Alex: Well that is then up to the Election Commission to approve.
Dana: I have a question. What about affiliating the candidacy of
your ticket with another school’s candidate?
Chris: I hadn’t really thought about that, but I am not worried.
Katie: Con
Jane: What about candidates who want to use the same name? I
think it adds unneeded complication to the campaign.

Dana: No.
David: I think that it is unfair to say because someone has
graduated that they can’t endorse. As a candidate, you should put
forth your support and value by anyone just because they are one
year out. Also if someone doesn’t know the alumni, it doesn’t cause
any detriment.
Katie: Pro speech
Mark: I am agnostic, but I think we should have this conversation.
But these guidelines
Lauren: Also, because we passed section V, I guess this applies
more to D, but we cannot use the ASG list serve to promote
candidates.
Parag: I think students only on this campus should vote. They are
the ones on campus and will vote. They can of course write the
Daily or something if they feel strongly.
Katie: Con Speech
Luke: I will have to disagree. We are apart of the Northwestern
community, and others besides current students should have the
right to have their voices heard.
Alex: Motion to strike B, and strike graduate students and alumni.
Katie: Okay would you like to explain?
Alex: Faculty and staff should be impartial but everyone else should
be okay.
Senator: 2nd
Senator: objection
Petros: I our oath we support the undergraduate students. And
having outside influence would be silly.
Isaac: I think grad students is fine. They have their own student
government and don’t really need to be concerned with us.
Alex: I would like to withdraw my amendment and reintroduce
keeping alumni.
Katie: Con speech

hold little importance to younger students.

Dillon: What if a candidate knows Stephen Colbert. They should be
able to get an endorsement.
Noah: Also, who cares if the student doesn’t know the alumni, it
really doesn’t make that much of a difference.
Katie: Con
Senator: It is the title that will carry weight not the fact they
graduated from here.
Katie: Okay we will be moving to a vote.
Noah: Can we clarify what we are voting on.
Katie: We are voting to cut line B and alumni from line C.
[division: 19, 8, 1 amendment passes]
David: I would like to amend to strike graduate students to say “all
current teaching assistants, excepting graduate students”.
Katie: Would you like to explain?

conflict of interest.

is to make sure that all perspectives are heard.

them there, and that
Katie: Pro speech
Harrison: There might be a conflict of interest if for say in theory a
junior exec member may be coerced into supporting a candidate for
fear that they may not get their position again.
Noah: If a candidate is that corrupt it will come up in other ways,
and the election should not be affected because of a hypothetical
case. It can be dealt on a case by case basis.
Petros: You have one year as ASG president, and you can waste
your entire year trying to get that year out of office. Such an event
happening will ruin all the progress we have made over the past
couple years. We need to regulate this to create a viable student
government.
Isaac: We are not barring exec from having an opinion. Everyone
can be aware of who someone supports.
Senator: So can an exec member serve on a campaign team?
Dana: yeah
Alex: That is a loophole. Motion to amend to add serve on a
campaign team.
[division: 15, 11, 1 amendment passes]
Katie: we are in line for a pro speech
Nikki: I think ASG is pushing to promote students on campus. And
the impact the exec board has is great and not endorsing will allow
for more conversations.
Ani: I would totally endorse someone from outside ASG if they are
the right candidate. Brad and Victor were from outside of ASG and I
would have endorsed them if I wasn’t Speaker. Also, if I support a
candidate I can make it known. And if I have a professional
evaluation of someone as a previous president, that is just more
information and another voice on campus. If the campus thinks that
I have done a terrible
Katie: You are out of time and Victor was a Senator and Brad was
on a committee.
Grace: It is just what Ani said. It is natural that your opinion will
lean towards what they people who are most experience say.

Senator: The undergraduates should decide who they are voting
for. I am trusting Northwestern students to take endorsements for
what they will. I think it is disrespectful to not have the exec board
endorse.
• Noah: By the logic that we should not allow exec members to
endorse because they have worked with them, we should bar all
student leaders that have worked with them from endorsing. That
just doesn’t make sense. If someone knows a position well and
someone who is running, they should be able to endorse.
New Business: SR1314-04: ASG Supports Trans* Students
o Petros: Trans* is a inclusive term, more inclusive than just
transgender.
o Alex: Why does this go without saying?
o Isaac: This was just presented at the conference and you all
should have your choice to vote.
o Petros: This would be a great gesture to a community
o Senator: Is there a certain group you are looking us to reach out
to.
o Isaac: No it just means to be more aware within your own
constituency.
o Katie: old business next week.
New Business: SR1314-05: Resolution Supporting the Affordable
College Textbook Act
o Lauren: This is in support of a bill that is currently working is
way through Congress. Our other resolutions coming next week
are academic based. We would like open-source textbooks to be
available to students.
o Isaac: Basically it is a free textbook online that would just
update.
o Lauren: And you would be able to print it out for a low cost. Also
I think this increases the competition of textbook providers. This
is also in the works at other Big 10 schools.
o Katie: Old Business next week.

Call to Order and Roll Call
Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
Executive Board Reports
• Ani: We are piloting joint office hours this quarter. FMO in the black
house tomorrow. That meeting is open to everyone. Please come
by, if you have any questions, please just text me or call. If you are
a member of student group that is interested in doing this, just let
me know.
• Alex: Hey guys. From what Rob talked about, we are helping plan
the Fall NU Day in Chicago. We have room for one more. We would
love for that person to be a Senator. Preferably a sophomore or
junior. Email me if you are interested. Also, I put a question in my
exec board report a question that I would like you to answer. We
are still working on Ignite and the freshmen first year experience.
We are meeting next week, and I would really like your input to
bring to the table. 10K presenting next week.
• Anna: Shadowing is happening this week, so you will hear about
that last week. We met about Double map this week. The ASG
basketball game is March 6. A sign up will be coming out tonight. IT
is great chance to talk to administrators in the athletics office.
Check out rest of projects in report.
o Lauren: Do you know when SPAC parking garage will open.
o Anna: Parking structural will be functional in next couple of
weeks.
• Sofia: Kresge is going under full reconstruction and I meeting with
administration about logistics. CTEC pilot, if you have any general
feedback, please send me your general feedback. We want to
rebuild platform for students and geared towards students. We are
have discussion about peer academic advising for premed students.
Lots of projects happening.
• Kevin: Community Engagement Grant application is live. Please let
students know about it to apply. Fulfill your PR requirement and
flyer. ‘Cats Come to Dinner-100 people signed up and we are
looking for hosts. Alderman meeting on the 27th on campus. IT will

Noah: We got our data from the ASG survey and we analyzed it.
We are drafting legislation for getting money to start an app. Let
me know if you are interested getting involved.
• Julia: Please encourage you and your friends to sign up for special
topic round tables. We have 5 for the rest of the quarter.
• Wes: We are working on green consulting and green accreditation
for students. Sending out survey about interest in an off-campus
composting service.
Special Order: Rob Donahue, Associate Director of the Center for Civic
Engagement
[No Questions]
Special Order: Dr. Lesley-Ann Brown, Director of Campus Inclusion and
Community
• Senator: What date is this happening?
• Posse: April 4-6
o Social movements in the 21st Century. What social
movements have happened and what do they look like now.
How can we make changes through the channels students
currently use, like social media. This our first year at
Northwestern, but the Posse Plus Retreat is annual and there
is always a topic. Every university with a Posse has a retreat
• Sofia: Who will be there.
• Posse: There will be students and faculty, we are all one
community.
• Senator: Will other students will be invited outside ASG?
• Posse: Yes, we are trying to engage as many students as possible.
100 students can go and there is a waiting list after this.
• Leslie: This is basically like sustained dialogue for 2 days. I know
some of you are involved in that, and that is out of my office. I
would love to see some of you all there. There will be 200 people
there and it really should be a great event. It is a very comfortable
space. Please share it with the groups you represent.
General Order: FVP/SGVP Application Release Date
• Ani: The Code is actually pretty lax about FVP and SGVP
applications and process. The application must be released by 5th
week and then be nominated and presented to Senate by the last
•

week. This is good because we have some flexibility. We ask to
move this back 2 weeks, because we have a constitutional forum
coming and position might be changing. We don’t want to release
an application if things are subject to change regarding the
positions. These positions are filled before the rest of the board,
because of funding cycles and they are supposed to be separate
from the rest of the selection process.
• Alex: Do we need to motion?
• Ani: It is an up/down vote.
• Lauren: If we wait 2 weeks, when would you release the app and
hold interviews?
• Ani: Applications released Feb 26, due march 5, and confirmed
march 12. All of this is still by the end of the quarter as in the Code.
[Vote passes]
Old Business: SR1314-04: ASG Supports Trans* Students
• Isaac: This is product of the Associate of the Big 10 Student
conference. It was a conference for all BIG 10 student
governments. A lot was discussed and these resolutions were
drafting. This is a resolution for trans* students. It is for student
support for students who don’t fit into the binary.
• Petros: The trans* is an underrepresented community, so this is
coming as a great time.
• Alex: Previous question
• Senator: 2nd
• Katie: We can just skip debate. Any object?
[Vote passes]
Old Business: SR1314-05: Resolution Supporting the Affordable College
Textbook Act
• Lauren: This is also a product of the conference. This is a resolution
in support of the affordable college textbook act that is being
debated in Congress. The idea is to make student textbooks more
affordable. NU students spends about $600 more than the average
college student on books per year. This is about a push towards
open source textbooks. This helps with the reprinting of editions
and students have to purchase additions. With open source, you

would just update the online version which students can view or
request to print. This program would be developed through grants.
• Adam: Is this promoting textbook companies to go open source, or
is this a push for NU not use company that is not open source?
• Isaac: This is more just a grant to encourage the start to open
source printing. Then we create a new competition of textbooks to
go open source.
• Sarah: these grants would for those who write textbooks?
• Lauren: It is for the universities. Ohio States has a program like
this. It is for higher institutions that would use the grant money to
launch programs with professors.
• Isaac: The Ohio State project looks like they
• Kevin: Senator Dick Durban also proposed this.
• Ani: Yes I was talking some administrators that would love to see
something like this pass.
• Kevin: this is something that we would talk about at other
conferences and it would affect the issues we discuss.
• Harrison: What impact does us passing this actually have?
• Isaac: Very little to be honest. But all the schools in the Big 10
collectively will have impact. And if Senator Durban is also behind
something like this too, we are increasing relations with him as
well.
• Ronak: Where is the grant program coming from.
• Isaac: it is coming from the act, so tax money essentially. The pilot
program is the act.
• Alex: PQ
• Senator: 2nd
[Vote passes]
New Business: SL1314-20: Helping Student Groups, One Position at a Time
• Ani: This is an idea that started last year and was dormant for a
while. After the past few days with Siddiq and Neel and their
committees. And now it is coming to you. The additional member to
the board will help us help you and give the resources for student
groups that they need on campus. We are proposing is creating a
3rd position to create a student group resources team. We like to
stay that we are helping student groups with our work and

allocation of $1.3 million each year. The VP for student activities
would be focused specifically on resources. They are going to look
at what we are offering student groups and how can we answer
them. They will answer questions like are presidents and vice
presidents properly trained, are there enough practice spaces? Neel
and Siddiq want to work on these projects but are very busy
working with their 150 student groups. So this
• Alex: What does an ideal candidate look like?
• Ani: Someone with some experience with SAFC or SGC or president
or treasurer of a student group on campus. We want someone who
has navigated the current system. This position will be our liaison
for lobbying for student groups on campus.
• Alex: Someone who is able to zoom out and see it not only from
their student groups experiences but all student group.
• Jane: Can you explain your rationale regarding the selection
process?
• Ani: This is a peer position, and that is how most of our positions
are selected. Also it will help with consistency regarding the
selection of the FVP and SGVP as well.
• Lauren: Would it follow the same timeline as the FVP and SGVP?
• Ani: That is the idea. You can also apply to multiple. The
constitutional forum will be Monday.
New Business: SL1314-21: Codifying University Student Advisory Board:
Everybody was Kung Fu Fighting (Those ‘Cats Were Fast as Lightning)
• Sofia: This bill is for adding another role for the AVP. For the past
year, I have been meeting with the 6 SAB. All school has one. I
have been sitting with them since last spring, and earlier in January
I brought together all of the boards. For them to cohesively
represent all students, it will need to be a cross-school conversation
to match the cross-school students. I had this conversation with all
SAB about codifying this meetings. This actually was an idea that I
found in the archives. SO I would like to add it to the Code for AVP,
who should act as the lobbyer across all the schools. They would
meet at least monthly.
• Alex: Can you give us an idea of the type of things you discussed at
your last meeting?

Sofia: We talked about creating consistency across the boards, such
as aligning their election processes. We also talk about the
effectiveness of meeting the needs of students across all the
schools.
New Business: SR1314-06: Support for Bankruptcy Protection for Students
• Lauren: In most consumer loans, actually all, if you fall into
circumstances where you can pay back a loan, and you find yourself
in a situation where you can’t pay back the loan, you can file for
bankruptcy. There are however many caveats. You though aren’t
able to do that for student loans. This resolution supports the idea
that students loans have the same protection as other student
loans. This also supports statute of limitations on student loan debt.
• Alex: An argument that I have heard in opposition, they can’t
repossess your diploma, like you could a car or house. It also might
make banks less willing to hand out loans. Do you have anything to
say in response?
• Isaac: Not everything can be repossessed, like a vacation. And this
is the most important thing you should spend money on, education.
• Lauren: It also is not that difficult to get a credit card, I think I
don’t have one, and it is not that hard to rack up debt.
• Isaac: Student loans are also federal loans and this used to be this
way.
Alex: Yeah and they were really hard to get. Once they stopped
applying bankruptcy, it became much easier to get loans. Sorry this
isn’t debate period though.
• Senator: What other schools have passed this?
• Isaac: The Big 10 conference passed it. I don’t know about
individual governments.
• Parag: What is the practical policy implication of us passing this
• Isaac: It is mostly just to pass pressure for lobbying.
New Business: SR1314-07: Support for Exemption of State Student Loan
Programs
• Isaac: Currently, the federal government only recognizes student
and private loans that they give. Certain states also have similar
programs. The idea behind this will just say that the state program
loans will hold the same recognition of federal loans.
•

Lauren: It will help provide lower interest rates. Ohio has a program
like this as well.
New Business: SR1314-08: Support for Ending Sequester Cuts on Higher
Education
• Lauren: IT was the beginning of last year that we fell of the fiscal
cliff. These sequester cuts were in result. One of the areas that was
most affected was education. $3 billion was cut. And for a unveristy
like NU, our research is dependent on this federal money. So a lot
of research has been cut across the board.
• Isaac: NU receives $500 million from the federal government each
year.
• Senator: How much did they cut from NU?
• Isaac: I don’t know
• Will: It was 15% of the $3 billion.
• Jane: Why should I care as an undergrad? Most of the money goes
to graduate students?
• Isaac: these do affect undergraduates and especially seniors who
want to stay and do research.
• Lauren: This also applies for undergrads who work with professors
for work study or not.
• Will: Why should we get special treatment with the Sequestion Act?
• Isaac: We have a lot of stake in it personally. And having a lot of
the Big 10 support this, it will apply pressure to stop the education
sequestion act.
• Senator: Do you have numbers for how this has affected NU
specifically?
• Isaac: I don’t have stats on that.
• Steven: I have heard about this and we haven’t been affected yet.
But schools outside the top 15 schools have been hit noticeably.
• Will: But why would this be not cut in the sequestion act?
• Isaac: This is what we can most applicably argue for.
• Noah: So if we pass this, are our lobbyists going to use this or is
this just in case if they do support this? Is this on the agenda?
• Isaac: As you know, Ani meets with lobbyists and it will be on the
agenda.
Good of the Order & Announcements

Adam: American Studies and Political Unions are holding a panel
about block on Israel studies.
• Parag: Like NU Cuisine on Facebook. Harrison and I are on the

information.
• Will: I am with MARS and we are making an awareness and support
video so go and participate really quickly.
• David: I should have said this earlier, but reapply for your seat!
Apps are due a week from today. I have only received a few. It is
easiest to access from the website. Also spread the word. DM Triva

Call to Order and Roll Call
Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
Executive Board Reports
• Katie: I will be reaching out to you about participating in DM kids
fair.
• Abby: None
• Ani: Nothing but what is in my exec board report.
• Alex: nu.n.chicago.org. Sign up for NU in Chicago. I will be leading
a group and maybe you could be in my group.
• David: 3 people, tell me what value is in being a senator?
o Alex: You get to represent kids on campus
o Steven: You get an insight into the bureaucracy and workings
of NU.
o Senator: You get to make impactful change.
Great. Please reach out to your student groups and tell them that.
We are extending student group senator
• Dillon: Are we allowed to have a club sports senators?
• David: I don’t know…yes. I would take it more seriously, or it would
be more compelling, if it was in an allegiance. You just have to be
NU recognized. The easiest way is to go onto the website and look
in the announcements stuff in the link.
• Anna: I had meetings this week about the Android double map app.
Should be fine. Had NUIT meeting this week. Basically Hulu + is
being piloting and we will see student feedback. They have been
using campus as a alternative to canvas. 60% of students said that
they wanted to change. Assessing data as well from coursera. Wi-Fi
updates during spring break.
• Sofia: I on a committee regarding the change to canvas. It will be a
phasing out process. Please send me a feedback if you have been in
a class that has used it or have something to say. They are meeting
tomorrow and soliciting ideas and other projects to look at, such as
video learning in classes. There is also a quality sub-committee
meeting tomorrow about picking furniture in the library. Let me
know if you have any suggestions. Last week we had a classroom
committee meeting last year. Kresge is going under a $90 million
overhaul starting next year.

Steven: Is it true it won’t be done until 2017.
Sophia: that could be true. And because of room allocation issues,
classes will start on 8:00am next year. I have been pushing for
8:30 or 9am-6pm. They are looking to enforce that only a certain
number of classes can be held at one time for space issues. We are
encouraging the registrar to move away from Caesar. Doing focus
groups for 3+E. Also apply for student faculty interaction grants!
• Kevin: Nothing new since last few weeks. Spread word about
community engagement grant if you know a group of people that
will engage the community in a positive way. Cats Come to Dinner
is this week. We met with some administrators about going to
Springfield soon. Check out exec board report for full projects.
• Noah: BY end of this week, we should have edits on unofficial
student guide this week. I want to give it to you guys first, so you
guys can give feedback.
• Julia: Committee working on expanding PR guide. We helped out
athletic office for talent show. Also shout out to Noah and Jacob
about faculty roundtables. Invite your friends and spread the word.
• Wes: Reminder if you live off campus, if you are interesting in
composting, we will send out a little survey.
Student Group Spotlight: Ubu Roi Recap
[Went well; 135 people in attendance collectively over 4 shows;
having trouble being recognized due to large number of recognized
theater groups]
• Alex: What show would you do if you were recognized?
• Scott: We have been talking about director petitions. We have
talked about putting up a series of 10-15 one acts with series. But,
if we don’t get recognized, we can’t put up another show. So we
have to solve that first.
Old Business: SL1314-18: In Order to Form a More Perfect Cabinet
• Alex: This is the move to make AVP and SGVP from a campus-wide
election process to the cabinet selections. These positions are peer
positions to the other cabinet positions and should be elected the
same way. These were elected this way because they were the only
cabinet members when the constitution was written. This will bring
us up to date. Also, it is contradictory of the

Alec: The Daily article was not in favor of this, comparing us to the
CCP. How would you respond?
Alex: Something to consider, anyone can write something for the
Daily.
o Ani: It was a column. What the columnist said had value,
minus the comparison. What he was trying to say that we
should take role of a student union fighting for student rights.
We are more of a facilitator role. What our structure is meant
to do is not march for every issue, but to pick which issues
are affecting the most of campus and fight for that through
letters, ASG Surveys, meeting with administration. We are
looking as an exec board of passionate people that fight with
technocratic means.
I think he was more trying to grab the heartstrings of
Northwestern. And I think this change will help get people we need.
Alex: How many non-ASG students came to Constitutional forum.
Alex: one, my girlfriend.
David: I am going to propose and amendment in the next
legislation, that ! of Senate can vote to not hold a forum. WE
amend the constitution multiple times a year, and the only time I
have seen someone outside ASG come to the forums in regard to
Senate reform.
Noah: Is there any concern that making this position app based,
that it will limit that candidate pool?
Alex: I can’t provide that many details, but having sat on the
cabinet selection committee two years now, but we have people
apply who aren’t on the committee for those positions.
Ani: Also, there is a much more rigorous app this year that will
force those on the committee to spell out what they did on and off
the committee.
Senator: What positions are directly voted on?
David: Pres, EVP, AVP, SGVP, and RHA.
Senator: How do you balance what student groups or the university
wants with what you think that will be good for the board.
Ani; I don’t think it is a question of how many positions are elected,
versus what positions. As a senator, you want to be close to your

•

constituents. And I don’t know if this would be the best positions for
direct election.
Serene: Don’t you think there is something to having a diverse
opinion on the exec board?
David: I think that is a great point. I agree that there should be
disagreement. I don’t the way that is happens right now is very
sensical. It is hard on a pragmatic level to promote someone to do
something they don’t want to do. But the agendas that people are
paying attention to are the President and EVP agendas. So this will
not squash discontent, but have the selection committee ask what
do you think of the agenda that was elected.
Sofia: I also think viewpoints are apart of it, but also the skill set
for the position. You will have some alignment of opinion, but there
will certainly be disagreement, as there currently is on committees.
But it is the leadership qualities that really need to be set apart.
Jane: Why do you think that the selection committee would be
better at selecting the VPs than the campus?
David: Well for one voter turnout. Also, a lot of people vote based
upon friend circles, a small sound bite, or the Daily. I think we can
have a more detailed and thorough discussion about who would be
best. I think when you are trying to convince 8,000 people to elect
you, you need a more concise pitch than to those who know more
about who need to be elected into the role.
Ani: Also, look at who is left for them to function. The President and
EVP more set the vision. The VPs carry out more day to day
operations and do bulk of work. So should the whole cabinet would
be elected? They are doing the work of carrying out the vision set
up by the President and Vice President.
Sofia: For me personally, it about outcomes. It is less about seeing
a platform and more about seeing the change that the Vice
president has done.
Jane: Motion to extend question period by 5 minutes.
Alex: Objection. It has already turned into debate.
[Voted to end of question]
Parag: I would like to motion to make this a open committee
process for AVP and SGVP.

David: Can I ask a clarifying question? Like are you asking to see
minutes, or know applicants?
Parag: Just know names of the applicants?
Ani: For all the cabinet positions?
Parag: Is that germane?
David: Can you make it optional for the candidates?
Ani: This isn’t even in the language of this legislation. That is all in
the Code.
Katie: Okay so that would be a Code change and we are not in line.
David: That would be something great to bring up in a week.
Ani: There are some Code changes in the bill, so if you can come up
with the language now we can add it?
Parag: Motion to recess for 5 minutes.
[Division-failed]
Katie: Con speech on entire bill.
Alex: As the off-campus whip, I am appointed by the caucus. I feel
that my role in ASG because it is a delegate position and thus I
would need to reach out to. Alex, based upon what I have heard on
campus, the students think this a bad idea. And if that is what the
students want, we should vote that way.
Lauren: Everyone I talked to were for this bill. The only concern
was who would be selecting the VPs. And after I explained the
process, they all were in favor.
Isaac: I think we should have more elected positions in general, but
I think the inherent issue is what the point of an election. The voted
positions are for vision, and the selected positions should be to
carry out that vision. And I see that fitting for these VP roles.
Katie: Con
Sarah: Last year, there were 4 positions elected by Senators and 4
elected by the campus. 2 of the Senate elections were moved to a
selection committee, and I raised this issue last year. And now that
we are in the same position, we have to look at why they were
originally set up like this in the first place.
Katie: Pro
Petros: this is a good move. To have 2 cabinet members elected at
large and not the rest is not good. A lot of positions on cabinet

should be voted on at large, like D&I. But this makes more sense. It
is not necessarily democratic, but it works.
Noah: Also, the two most directly elected positions are on selection
committee. Also the real cabinet are tapped by president and EVP.
Ani: POI- the President and EVP are not the majority vote on the
selection committee.
Parag: So selecting these positions, does not solve problem of voter
turnout, so we should solve that problem. I am not saying this
wouldn’t work, but it wouldn’t solve the problem.
Ronak: Petros said that we have to balance the democracy in ASG,
and where is that line. If we pass this, the only directly elected
positions would be President and Vice President and RHA Senators.
So to be more democratic, shouldn’t we make all the positions
campus wide.
Katie: Pro
David: I just wanted to clarify that the low voter turnout was just to
clarify much of the campus is not engaged.
Sofia: If you look at the Code, the job of these VPs are to lobby.
The Senators are there to represent, but my job is lobby. I am
there to work on items that students want me to work on. When
you lose the ability to meet student concerns, the VP position is
useless, which did happen 2 years ago.
Isaac: Motion to amend, I would like to add “2 students elected by
Senate.” I want to leave it open, if there is interest outside of
Senate.
Senator: 2nd
Senate: objection
Isaac: The big problem is taking away the power from the students
and this could be potentially help.
Petros: Senate still has to confirm candidate anyway. Majority of us
have to agree, so I find the additions redundant.
o Ani: Actually it is 2/3.
Katie: Pro speech on amendments.
Parag: I think that is would make the process more democratic.

to confirm, so lets add new people.

Katie: Con speech
Alex: The concern still stands we are taking away democracy from
the students, and 2 (most likely Senators)
Sarah: I think this comes down to priority. Whether that is making
the process more efficient, or implementing student opinion. We
have to make sure that this is in line with the purpose of ASG.
Katie: Pro
Alec: I think by taking away these elections, people will be able to
pay more attention to President and EVP.
Eliza: I think in an ideal situation, we hope that students are
looking at the issues, but that is not true. People vote based on
stickers and how the campaign looks.
[Debate extended by 5 minutes]

Ronak: If the issue that the students are engaging in the elections,
then we are arguing that the students are not engaged enough to
vote on any members? Any speakers can talk about that.
• Dana: I can speak to this. The EVP and President have received
almost double the amount of votes in prior years. Last year, they
had to vote for all positions, but people could have been just voting
because they wanted to vote for President and EVP.
• Adam: We need to address voter apathy, but I think this is a halfassed was to do this. So let’s just vote on the bill.
• Katie: Con speech. Okay final pro.
• Noah: I think many of the cons are about not this in general, but
ASG as a whole. I think there are plenty of ways for student voice
to be implemented, like senate confirmations. I think it is more
democratic to vote this in to align with the peer positions.

Old Business: SL1314-19: Cleaning the Constitution: Constitution Review
Winter 2014
• Ani: It comes to Preamble, replacing Alex (it’s Katie), and mention
Code in constitution, changed some to active voice. We also defined
some newer cabinet members.
• Sarah: Motion to end question period.
• Katie: Moving to debate.
• David: Motion to amend. This will pragmatically or allow to move to
eliminate a constitutional forum by ! vote. It takes 2/3 of Senate
to approve the changes. So to eliminate the forum, it should be a
higher vote. A lot of changes in the Constitutional is procedural.
And if we hold a forum, no one will attend and it doesn’t make
sense to hold it. You would still need 2 weeks before it is voted on.
It is not worth the humiliation, the resources or the room in Norris
that no one will attend.
• Isaac: So would you be open to the idea to make this unanimous?
•

David: Yes that’s fine. I think it should be !, but if that’s a huge
thing.
• Isaac: I object. Motion to make it a unanimous vote. “waived with a
unanimous vote of Senators.” If it is more procedural, it will be
democratic and it will be unanimous, but if it is a bigger issue, a
forum should be held.
• Senator: If someone though just votes against it out of principle,
like you often do about moving things to old business out of
principle, that is defeating the point of the amendment.
• Dillon: Motion to change it to 9/10.
• Senator: Objection.
• Senator: PQ
• Lauren: So we are voting on 9/10, then it will revert back to
unanimous, and then vote on ! versus unanimous.
• Katie: yes. Okay so if you vote yes on this, then we vote on !
versus 9/10.
[Passes]
Okay, so now vote in favor of 9/10 over 3/4.
[Division-16, 17, 2 FAILS]

Old Business: SL1314-21: Codifying University Student Advisory Board:
Everybody was Kung Fu Fighting (Those ‘Cats Were Fast as Lightning)
• Sofia: This bill is very straight forward. All 6 schools have SAB. We
all met last Thursday and it went very well. I just want to codify
this. This is actually an old bill that was not transitioned. This would
help with lobbying across the schools. And it gives the group more
communication.

Old Business: SR1314-06: Support for Bankruptcy Protection for Students
• Lauren: This is what we brought up last week. This is to increase
bankruptcy projection for students for student loans. For right now,
it is possible to have your student loans included in you bankruptcy
statement, it is very hard. This would just make it easier. Originally,
student loans were held to the same standard as other loans. It was
gotten rid of over time due to lobbying from the bank industry. We
are just asking for the same projections for these types of loans.
• Alex: Would you by any chance how much students have on
average in loans from NU?
• Lauren :I think $30,000
• Isaac: that is just an average for students who have loans?
• Parag: Do you think this would limit the number of loans given out?
• Isaac: That is a definite concern with the way supply and demand
work. The fear might be interest rates might go up. Federal loan
interest cannot go up, but private loans can. But federal loans have
a built-in need detector.
• Lauren: This resolution also states that the student loans go under
the Truth and Lending Act, which states to explain the process for
loan selection and how the interest rates are picked. We are not
trying to take away students’ education, just give them more
projection.
• Alex: PQ
• Senator: 2nd
• Senator: Object.
• Katie: We are now going to vote on moving to PQ
[Passes]
Okay, we will vote on the entire bill.

Old Business: SR1314-07: Support for Exemption of State Student Loan
Programs
•
•
•

Isaac: This is just saying, that if a state provides a state loan
program it should be regulated like a federal loan program.
• Alex: What are objections about this issue?
• Isaac: I am not aware of any right now, other than just against it.
• Dana: How is it differently regulated?
• Lauren: One way is how colleges can promote these loans. These
loans also have much lower interest rates, but it seems kind of
fishy. And this would just help regulate it.
• Alex: PQ
• Senator: 2nd
[Passes]
Old Business: SR1314-08: Support for Ending Sequester Cuts on Higher
Education
• Lauren: Sequestering came to be so that congress could come
together and create a budget. And higher education took a large
hit. All 8 programs, besides the Pell Grant, were hit. Federal Work
Study for example were hit, as well as many others. I have exact
numbers if you guys were interested. Research aid were also
affected. This may seem removed. But may of those who work in
labs were also cut. So if you work as an undergraduate in a lab, if
you are paid from work study or a grant, funding was cut.
• Alex: How were Iraq and Afghanistan veterans affected?
• Lauren: It is grant for those whose parents were killed or injured in
the army do get aid and don’t get as much funding now.
• Alex: That’s bullshit.
• Ani: Come on guys.
• Lauren: We agree too.
• Senator: PQ

Executive Board Reports
• Katie: The last Senate of this quarter will be March 12th. So if you
have something to bring up before then, bring it up soon.
• Alex: We are presenting 10K ideas today. The CCE Day in Chicago,
the link is in my exec board report, is happening this weekend.
Katie and I are leading groups, it’s a great chance to see Chicago.
• Ani: Please take a good look at the Sexual Assault Policy Reform
Resolution. I also regret to inform you that Neel had to resign for
personal reasons. A new appointment process will take place as
normal and I will sit as his replacement until then.
• David: I am emailing groups right now that will not have to
interview for SGAC. 8 groups have automatic approval. The rest of
interviews will take place Saturday 11-2pm. 19 apps were received
for 15 seats.
o Alex: Who sits on the selection committee?
o David: You, with the other caucus whips, Parliamentarian,
Speaker, FVP, SGVP
• Alex: Oh something from Kevin and Isaac, they wanted me to
prompt you guys with judging applicants for the grants. It would be
a great chance to get involved in the process and see how
connections are made between Evanston and NU.
• Ani: Also, B-Status funding is new business this week. One group
will be having a late submission and we will review
• Noah: Our ad contest is seeking funds. We are still working on
Study Abroad Guide…more cities completed. Please, please help me
edit the unofficial student guide. This is very important as
representatives of NU Students to help influence and edit this
guide.
• Ani: The FVP and SGVP apps will be live for a week following the
end of Senate. If you have questions about FVP, contact Siddiq, and
if you have questions about SGVP, let me know and I can try to
answer it or point you in the right direction. Just some background,
the FVP helps allocate most of the 1.4 million SAF to A-status
groups. The VP works with a group of Senator and non-Senator.

The SGVP does similar work with B and T-Status groups with a
smaller sum of money. They work on student group programming,
SOFO training, recognizing and derecognizing groups.
o Lauren: If we pass the constitutional amendment, will the
SAVP application also go out tonight?
o Ani: Yes. We are also releasing the Chief of Staff application
tonight. We selected it last year during the regular transition
cycle, but it doesn’t make sense that the chair of the selection
committee be transitioning itself.
o Harrison: Did we vote to change it?
o David: It is not specified in the Code, so we just changed it.
General Order: Release of Applications for Financial Vice President, Vice
President for Student Groups, and Chief of Staff
General Order: 10K Committee Presentation
• Ideas:
o A More Comfortable Library
o Much Money in Evanston
o Wildcat Statue
o Northern Lights
o Lakefill Swingset
• Senator
• Korri: Is the library supplementing that funding? I feel like I saw
signage about new chairs to “try out!”
• Anna: I don’t think so, but the university also uses these
suggestions as a means to find out what students are wanting on
campus
• Alex: The library was actually super pumped that students cared
about this.
• Senator: For the swingset, would there be budget for a trampoline?
• Alex: No, sorry.
• Senator: When you mean “Northern Lights,” do you mean string
lights or more lights?
• Julia: Just string lights were included in the financial analysis.
• Senator: For munch money in Evanston, have you talked to
business that they will subsidize or are you just assuming.

Evan: NO we haven’t but JPK assured us that businesses she has
talked to are very interested.
• Katie: Okay we can move to vote on all of the ideas or can vote to
strike.
• Lauren: I thought we only took 3?
• Katie: At least 3.
• Harrison: Motion to move to vote on all of the ideas.
Old Business: SL1314-20: Helping Student Groups, One Position at a Time
• Ani: SO this came to Senate 2 weeks ago. We chatted of course
with FVP and SGVP and GEs and AEs. WE looked at the charge of
these positions and we are actually fulfilling the needs of the
student groups we are serving. We want to make sure that we are
advocating for them, acting as a resource, anything to improve
their abilities to function as a student group. Some we can do,
some faculty, and some as a collaboration. Based upon what we
saw, a Student Activities VP was seen as necessary to take care of
these more blanket problems that affect all student groups. This
position does not overlap with the student group funding and
programming work that the GEs and AEs do, but
• Alex: Can you give some examples of some projects this committee
would work on?
• Ani: Where will student groups practice when Kresge is full. What
about storage for student groups? How are is booking and
reservations as a whole for students, do they need to pay?
• Steven: Was this due to the working groups findings?
• Ani: It was in conjunction, but this project to help improve student
groups is huge. We need a committee dedicated to working towards
this.
• Steven: If the working group finds we need a third tier of funding,
would this group take that over?
• Ani: No, I don’t think so. This group is not charged with dealing
with funding. But, it is our job as a whole to make sure we are
serving groups to the best of our abilities as an organization.
• Alex: You mentioned you had been working on the app for this
position, what are some examples of questions you are going to
ask?
•

Ani: [Application posted] This application is very different than the
FVP and SGVP. It is more in line with that of the Services VP or
other cabinet positions, as that is in line with the position.
• Senator: Motion to end question period.
• Ani: Motion to amend all amendments in green. Siddiq pointed this
out. The FVP is the official auditor of ASG, they are our AE. If there
is a vacancy, the most senior AE would take this responsibility. For
the SAVP, the 25-hour a week work load would be significantly
increased if they have to attend all SAFC and SGC committees, so
this allows the SGVP and FVP tell them they are not need at a
committee. The next one is to adjust the members of the selection
committee, . Same thing for FVP. The last is to reiterate that the
FVP is the receiver of the SAF funds.
• Senator: Motion to end debate period.
• Senator: PQ
• Katie: Okay, we will move to a vote
[passes unanimously]
New Business: B and T-Status Funding
• Ani: There are a lot of groups applying, like 50, and some groups
that still need to get apps in due to our error. So they will be
reviewed later this week. The committee has a full work load, but
we are moving forward. Questions?
• Lauren: so how many B-Status groups are there? More than 50
right?
• Ani: About 100 but they don’t always apply for funding.
• Alex: What did Abunav get no funding?
• Alex: ASG funding is supposed to be for the entire community. And
they asked for money for costumes or internal needs.
• Ani: And if there is any discretion between if funding would be for
internal or external needs, such as it would be okay for funding for
costumes used in a new show or something, we would look at that.
New Business: SR1314-09: Sexual Assault Policy Reform Resolution
• Noah: this is a resolution that echoes the petition put on
change.org, particularly how we deal as a university with sexual
violence. The first part is why as northwestern we should care, and

the be it resolved highlights and explains what is in the petition
online. I can further elaborate on that later.
Parag: we also added a clause about Professor Ludlow and his
dismissal.
Noah: No we don’t have it in there.
Senator: No, it was in there this morning.
Noah: It was an error on my part. I sent in the wrong draft.
Senator: Can we add in back in?
Noah: We can discuss that in question period.
Adam: Has he been found guilty yet?
Parag: He was charged with sexual misconduct. The board of
trustees found him guilty, but they found in a new way to
Laruen: Have you heard of any mishandlings on Northwestern’s
campus specifically?
Noah: No I haven’t. But the point of this is to make sure in all
future cases that the correct measures and protections are taken.
Parag: There are a lot of cases at other universities?
Senator: What would happen if this happens again during the
investigation process?
Parag: They would be suspended.
Noah: Look and sections 4 and on, on the petition. It elaborates
more about the processes.
Adam: What might be helpful for next week would be to send out
the findings of the Ludlow case.
Lauren: So [READ OUT CHANGE] was that there this morning?
Noah: That was due to conversations I had with exec members.
Professor Ludlow has been suing for deformation, and I didn’t want
to put us in danger.
Lauren: So that would also make students liable as well?
Noah: Based upon the language of the petition, I don’t think so. It
is really specific.
Jane: Motion to move this to old business.
Senator: Objection
Katie: We are going to move to debate. Jane.
Jane: I think this is a very important topic and in a very present
light right now.

Alex: I couldn’t agree with you more. By not passing it tonight, it
will be in the news cycle for 2 weeks and it will gather a larger
storm on support that this speech deserves.
Senator: PQ
[passes to old business]
Senator: Motion to amend. I want to change the word “crime.” We
don’t really use that word on campus. Actually, just strike “crimes
of”
Jamie: We also need to define what it means to commit sexual
assault.
Lauren: Now with the proposed amendment, if the university finds
someone committed sexual assault, what steps will they take. I am
just a little confused.
Jane: I can answer this. You have to specify court of law. This is for
jus the university.
Parag: This is just this for the university.
Katie: How about we amend to say “as defined by the University?”
Would you like to move to a vote?
[Vote passes]
Alex: Motion to amend. In the be it resolved section, I think we
should put Peter Ludlow’s name back in the bill. It is not making
any accusations, just saying that we aren’t comfortable on campus.
Strike “ any member…” and put Peter Ludlow.
Senator: 2nd
Robert: Objection.
Robert: I am not opposed to putting his name back in, but I want to
keep the original clause.
Alex: I change my
Lauren: Would that clause include anyone who has ever been found
guilty of this or only in the future.
Noah: The reason we chose community member is because these
procedures and policies protect not just students.
Jane: This might go against what UHAAS is passing, which might
later cause problems.
Jamie: Motion to divide question.

Katie: okay we will vote on Ludlow’s name and then community
members.
• Jane: I am worried that adding his name would put ASG at risk of
• Petros: Also, in terms of this perpetuating in the future, it might be
too specific keeping his name. This would make it more general.
• Alex: This guy doesn’t scare me. If you guys are worried about a
law suit, vote that way. But I am not.
• Steven: I think keeping the resolution as universal as possible
would be best. Keeping in a name might just make it seem
reactionary.
• Franco: I think it is unprofessional to take shots at a single guy.

each round of elections. If you want to rule against that, I will bring
it up.
• Katie: How was it worded?
• Abby: It was vague, left up for interpretation.

Alex: What would disqualify you for running?
Katie: If you are planning on running for that position. Nominations
Alex: I nominate Arjun.
Arjun: I decline
Harrison: I nominate Petros.
Petros: I accept.
Dana: I nominate myself.
Senator: I second.
Alex: Motion to skip all of this.
Katie: we can’t motion to white ballot until they are introduced.
Petros: I am the senator for Rainbow Alliance
Dana: I am a APO senator. This is my 3rd year in ASG and I was
here for the creation of this position and I know ASG constitutional
memory very well.

General Order: Financial Vice President Selection Committee Election
• Katie: we need one student for this selection committee.
• Alex: I nominate Adam Roth.
• Adam: I accept
• Harrison: I nominate Gui.
• Gui: I accept.
• Katie: Will you introduce yourselves.
• Adam: I am Adam and I am already on SAFC and I know the
members well. I love working with student groups about how to
help them better as ASG. And I think knowing that is important in
selecting a new leader.
• Gui: I am a sophomore in Weinberg and I know Harrison, which is
how I know about this. I am involved in AISEC and I am treasury
for a group on campus.
• Adam: is their another position that you would want more than this
on the selections committee.
• Adam: Definitely FVP or SAVP. I have spoken a lot with student
groups and I think I would be good at both.
• Gui: Same.

Adam: FVP is for A-status groups, SGVP is for band T-status
groups. And SAVP is something completely different.

Election

because we have vacancies we have 2 open spots.
• Jamie: I am a junior and this is my 5th member as a Greek Senator.
I think the position is interesting because as ASG we are always
trying to help student groups. I would
• Noah: I am a sophomore and NCDC senator. I want to be on the
committee because I have a democratic demeanor of sorts, and I
think that also plays into the types of student groups I am on. I am
involved in a wide range of groups, and I think I would have a good
perspective.
• Harrison: I am sophomore and the RHA/RCB caucus whip. We often
don’t have new exec positions and the person selected will set a
precedent.
• Grace: I am an RCB senator. I am on Rules and EC, and I do
believe that the first person sets the precedent. And I would like to
help be apart of that important decision.
• Adam: Sort of like what I said before, I am very passionate about
student groups. I think this position is a great idea. I think there
•
•

are a lot of ways ASG can help student groups and this position is a
great step in the right directions to fill the gaps.
• Adam: Why do you not want to be SAVP?
• Noah: I don’t want to be SAVP because there are people who have
an institutional knowledge that is much greater than mine, but I
have proper insight as to who would hold that knowledge.
• Harrison: I am involved in a lot of student groups, and I know what
type of person should fill it, but I don’t think that is me.
• Grace: As a freshman, I have not been involved in the financial
committees. So I want to be involved in the selection, but I would
not be a good candidate.
• Adam: I did want to run for this position, because I recently got
selected to be an RA. And, I don’t want to overload myself. But
• Jamie: Two groups I am involved (Wildcat Welcome and ASG) in is
looking at a larger picture and helping it. I have gotten a lot of
experience look at grander pictures, and I think I would be good to
select someone who looks at a larger picture in a role like this.
[Winners: Jamie and Noah]
General Order: Vice President for Student Groups Selection Committee
Election
• Katie: While those ballots are counted, we will move on to the next
election, which is for the two positions on the Student Groups Vice
President Selection Committee. Nominations.
• Harrison: I would like to nominate Guilehmo.
• Adam: I’d like to nominate Harrison.
• Amol: I nominate Parag.
• Harrison: I drop out.
• Katie: Nomination floor is closed.
• Gui: I just want to bring a new perspective and learn how things
work.
• Parag: This is my first year in ASG and I want to understand how
the committee works and get more involved. I’m involved in SASA
and we are an umbrella organization.
• Motion to white ballot.
• Katie: All those in favor, please say aye. Any opposed or
abstaining? Wonderful.

Old Business: B and T-Status Funding
• Katie: Now we are going to go into funding. I will read off the
names of the groups in a randomized order. We will be doing an
add round first, then a cut round.
• Alex: How much money do we have to give out?
• Ani: This quarter is a bit unusual. We have an unexpected
leadership change, but that didn’t affect much. Our committee did
not send out the application to a capella groups on time, so we had
to add them to the pool. We had made decisions without the a
capella groups and were a bit more generous than normal. We are
able to sustain the pool, which is $2000 more than normal. There
are 3 groups here that are not on the list. They had some expected
issues falling under “shit happens.” We will put up
recommendations for them. The amendment pool will increase from
$724. The 3 new applications will come from our general fund,
because they really aren’t considered as amendments. There costs
will raise our allocations for $16,000 which would amend the
amendment pool so it is still 5% of the total allocations.
• Lauren: Are we doing A-status funding next week?
• Ani: No, there funding happens in Fall and spring.
• Lauren: Will B and T-Status also have funding in the spring?
• Ani: No the fall.
• Katie: You cannot vote for the groups that you represent in
Senate. I think only one of you falls in that category.
• Isaac: How does half absence count?
• Katie: You cannot vote.
• Alex: Why aren’t we doing the missing groups first.
• Ani: That is up to you.
• Alex: Motion to do that
• Katie: will you state who the 3 groups are.
• Ani: Blast, Extreme-Measures, and Jewish Theatre Ensemble.
• Senator: 2nd
• Katie: Blast come up and introduce yourself.
• Blast: Our funding got lost in our GEs spam folder. In the spring
though we have our biggest show and classes that are open to the
public, so we really need the funding to do this programming.

Katie: Any questions?
Ani: We are pulling some information up, so can JTE come in early.
JTE: There was some issues with our funding. We got funded in
excess for the past year, because ASG had originally though Hillel
funded us which is not true. But we would like to apply for funding.
Alex: So it was ASG's fault.
JTE: It was a series of miscommunications.
GE: I talked to their GE and they had a lack of receipts which
resulted in a misconduct that they thought applied to Spring
funding, which it doesn’t.
Katie: Can someone come speak for Xtreme measures.
Chris: I am doing it. They received their application late, because of
receiving application late and a computer crash.
GE: So we had some problems with the applications. By the time I
got the application, SGC had already met so I told them to go
through funding like this.
Sarah: Can we vote to add the pages and then go through like
normal.
Senator: 2nd
Katie: does everyone understand? So they would just get added,
but you can then appropriately add or cut as the rounds go.
Dana: Can we get the SGC’s opinion? Because to my knowledge
they haven’t been reviewed.
Ani: We are
GE: We all have had the opportunity to at least view the
application, so as we can see there is nothing glaringly wrong.
Jane: Will we know the new amendment pool amount?
Katie: Yes we would be told. [To SGC] How much would that be?
Ani: About $800
Katie: We are now voting to include the Blast and Xtreme Measures
in the packet
[vote passes]
Katie: We are now in line for an add line. You may look at your
computers, if you are using it for funding.

was a care package for $75 that I think was intended as
internal use. It is not for internal use.

we do not fund new events either way.

than $20 for publicity.

rules of the SGC for funding?

their recommendations.

where the amounts come from.

Ani: Motion to add JTE.

Ani: The page of SGC recommendations. They have an addition
they want to make.
Katie: So you are adding the SGC’s recommendations?
Ani: Yes.
Senator: 2nd

Katie: So we are going to do an add round for JTE. JTE.
JTE: Motion to add, but we haven’t seen our recommendations yet.
I would like to add money for costumes, $100.
Katie: Is there a second?
Second
Katie: Objections?
Jacob: The reason for the late application is because we thought we
could not apply because of a misconduct. We did not transfer from
our O2 line to our OO line in time, because we did not have receipts
from last spring.
SGC: In your SOFO account there are subaccounts. SGC money
goes to the O2 line and they spend out of their OO line. They are
forced to transfer, which means they need to get a signature from
their GE. Then after the signature they can transfer the money.
JTE: However, because we didn’t have those receipts, we couldn’t
do that.
Ani: Because they could have gotten SOFO for copies, this still
technically counts as a misconduct. We are trying to make an
exception, so we are giving $100 due to standardization of the SGC.
Katie: So we are going to add $100 to costumes.
Senator: 2nd
[vote passes]
JTE: Motion to add $50 to lighting. It costs $700, so even $50
would help, totaling $100.

GE: We think we are being more than fair by allocating to them half
of what they are asking for. They have had many
miscommunications issues, so we feel like we really did make that
effort.
JTE: Yes, our GE did reach out to us. But we also reached out to her
for this round of funding. And for that meeting, we had to cancel it
last minute. I tried to personally meet with the GE, but she said
that she would rather meet with our treasurer. Basically, timing just
never worked out.
Katie: Any objections? Okay we will move to a vote.
[vote passes]
JTE: motion to add $17.50 to program copies.
Senator: 2nd
JTE: We have to make 300 copies of our programs, and we could
use the $17.50
Ani: I don’t mean to be an asshole, but we are trying to be as fair
as possible to all groups. Their GE reached out 4 or 5 times, and it
is unfortunate that the meeting got canceled.
GE: We also do quarterly audits, and when their GE asked for their
audit, she received no word. We are just trying to be as fair as
possible.
Jane: Object
Katie: Okay we will move to a debate.
Jane: Yes, I understand the misunderstandings. But, groups have
played by the rules and deserve the money.
Katie: Pro speech
JTE: I understand but we are not complacent. There was a
transition that we were not even aware of during the
miscommunication last year when there was the Hillel
misunderstanding. I may not have been copied on those emails, but
Shih Yung has not reached out to us 5 times, and I tried to reach
out to her twice. I also was never let known we could get copies,
but I will for now definitely do that. I also did not know we could
bring in an audit trail.

hour now. Apparently, there is a special sound mixing
process for Bhangra to keep the traditional sound

mixing. But, as I understand it is for competition. And
the SGC funds items that benefit the whole school.
! Katie: Do we have a 2nd?

! Jane: Objection. I feel like this is something you could
fundraise for.

dues, but this is to even out the amount.

performances are off campus.

! Sarah: I don’t think this is an appropriate place to ask
for funding. I think it would be better as a project pool
request.
! Grace: I think I remember your group from the SASA
show that definitely had a unique sound. We do fund a
lot of single events. And because they do perform 3
times on campus, I think we should fund it.
! Ronak: Also, we shouldn’t punish them for using a track
off campus, because they will use it on campus too.
! Sarah: How many mixes are there for the year?

Parag: The $200 is for the whole year and it is what is
used at SASA show.
! GE: We understand the cause, but we have a standard
sound amount. We had another group apply for $1600
for an off campus event, and we turned down that
funding as well.
! Jane: We are funding it partially. And because this mix
will be only used partially on campus, we should
partially fund it. Also, there dues could cover it if they
wanted.

• April: I’m April the coordinator of FMO, and Karley our treasurer
could not be here. We had a lot of venues in mind for our spring
show. We wanted the Shandley Shack or 27 Live, but both of those
won’t work out. So we are taking this as a opportunity to try
something new. SO we booked Norris East Lawn. We have gotten a
quote for a stage for $3100. I think we should get this event funded
because we have been working really hard. We can’t announce our
speaker yet, but we have a band lined up as

• April: We are meeting with our advisor to get exact numbers?
• Lauren: will the $700 you have been given already be subtracted
from the account.
• April: Yes we will
• Serene: Do you have a back up if it is bad weather.
• April: We are looking for one.
• Serene: What would be your top choice if the stage doesn’t work
out.
• April: we would go to our rain option when we figure that out.
• Isaac: When is this
• April: April 19th
• Eliza: have you gone to any departments?
• April: We are looking to go to the office of the president.
• Harrison: Are there any ways to make the event cheaper to cover
costs of the stage?
• April: We can cut corners, but if we don’t get this funding we will
seek other sources.
• Serene: How much does the stage cost, with lights and everything?
• April: $700
• Serene: Don’t you get money for the venue too?
• April: Yes $525 that paid for the lawn. We need slightly more for
vendors and things like that to have at the show.
• Isaac: can you have a line item list next week?
• April: Yes, definitely.
• Eliza: How are you planning on advertising?
• April: We are looking to advertise via Facebook, instagram and

New Business: SL1314-23: Global Village

Haley: Yes we are looking to join with AIESEC to help with Global
Village. We are hosting 40 student groups and food and are
reaching out to a lot of students.
Alex: it was really loud last year. Will it be this year?
Haley: IT will be on Deering, so hopefully that will help.
Isaac: If your budget only increased $500, why are you asking for
$1500.
Haley: We are looking to make ASG a major sponsor.
Dana: How confident are you that you will get 700-1000 students.
Haley: AIESEC and Deering Days combined have a lot of PR reach
and we have an aggressvie plan.
AIESEC: Also, it will be a huge event on Deering instead of in
Parkes so students walking by will see it.
Lauren: So if you want us to be a sponsor, will you come back last
year and ask for this money again?
Chris: that is a hard question because right now Deering Days is an
umbrella group of ASG.
Serene: If Deering Days and ASG are so intertwined, why do we
need to sponsor this/
Chris: ASG funds $5000 to Deering Days at the beginning of the
year. And like A&O who was an umbrella group, we eventually will
work separately.
Isaac: What funding have you secured?
Haley: we have reached out to over 20 departments.
AIESEC: We are also talking to One Book One Northwestern and the
Office of the President. But we are finalizing numbers
Isaac: How much money from Deering Days is going to this event?
Chris: None
Ani: So you have no money.
Chris: No it was used on the welcoming BBQ.
Ani: the fall BBQ is another animal. The biggest cost is the $3500
surround sound system we have that we figure we don’t need
anymore. The rest of the money goes to tents. Global Village will be
using the same vendor. We also have to lay down floorboards on
the table.
Serene: So what sort of sound system are you using?

Chris: $160 Norris sound system. [gesturing to screen] This is kind
of our event walk through and what we envision.
New Business: SL1314-24: ASG Campaign Guidelines for Residential
Emailing
• Chris: I am bringing forth an addition to the election guidelines. I
know we already reviewed them, but I wanted to make sure all
relevant parties were aware. So I am here with EriK Zorn the RHA
President. There was a lot of tension last year with campaign emails
over the list servs in the 29 undergraduate housing options. So, if
you choose to send out emails, you have to follow these guidelines.
• Erik: These guidelines are beneficial because all governments have
different guidelines for list servs, and these guidelines are
amendable to that. And because these would be apart of the EC,
complaints could go to the Election Commission instead of the hall
governments.
• Chris: So if a candidate wants to send out campaign list servs, the
hall can choose to send out 4. We got to 4 due to talking with
previous candidates. A single person will be designated to send it
out. With endorsements, this places the burden on the campaign.
So for example, if Eric was president of Chapin, he has to reach out
to the campaign for them to advertise the endorsement.
• Harrison: So what is the structure on who gets punished?
• Chris: It depends. For example, if someone sends over 4 emails,
that is up to the EC to give a punishment to the candidate. If it is a
RHA/RCB’s fault, the government can deal with it. And, residential
services has been notified.
• Dana: Have these been put in the RHA/RCB codes?
• Chris: No
• Nikki: Can the EC elect someone to send out the emails?
• Chris: Yes the EC could allocate it like that, but it is up to them.
• Parag: What if the President for example forgets to send out the
email. That would be up to RHA/RCB to deal with.
• Serene: How will you make sure the RHA/RCB will stick with this in
the future?
•

Chris: That is always a challenge. They didn’t have my role of
Director of Residential Services before last year, so it is important
to keep up communications through this role.
• Erik: Also we have designated ASG people in RHA/RCB.
Good of the Order & Announcements
• Jenny: I am selling friendship bracelets for DM for $3.
• Isaac: Community Grant, if you want to help with selection, let me
know

ballot, so we will be taking a look at it right now.
• Sarah: Do we not need a no confidence option?
• Alex: If there are only two, we really don’t need to.
• Mark: Are we going to have faculty honor roll nominations on here?
• Sheng: We can.
• Chris: Do you still need to confirm and submit like last year?

General Order: Speaker of the Senate Election
• Evan: I would like to nominate Harrison.
• Harrison: I accept.
• Senator: I nominate Noah Star.
• Noah: I accept.
• Alex: I would like to nominate you again Katie.
• Katie: I respectively decline. Jobs. Anymore? Please line up so we
can start introductions.
• Harrison: Hi, I am a sophomore and the RHA/RCB Caucus Whip. I
have been a senator since fall of my sophomore year. ASG, outside
of school, has been one of my favorite Northwestern experiences.
When I was elected caucus whip, I wanted to make the RHA/RCB
Caucus as robust as possible. I met with all of the senators and
followed up with them about their interests and what they wanted
to get out of ASG as senators. I have been able to help get projects
started. We have no vacancies, our attendance is great. We have
great discussion. I would love to engage Senate at large next year.
I want to make Senate more than just a meeting next year.
• Noah: Hi, I am Noah Star. I am a sophomore. I have served as
NCDC Senator for the past year. I would like to outline my
trajectory in Senate and why I want to be Speaker. I missed
regular orientation last year, and coming in I was a little

overwhelmed by the great students in this room. I was a little
hesitant to speak, but I think my work on the PR committee helped
give me confidence to speak up about my vocal and graphical
interests in ASG. I have now spoken up more about the issues I feel
passionate about in Senate. I am passionate about Senate and
based on my journey, I would like to make you all as passionate as
I am. I have a met with a lot of you. I think there is a lot of areas
for improvement as well things that we are doing well. I have
developed a platform. I think Senate needs to be more democratic,
political, and legislative. I think we need to improve recruitment
and keep our great recruits. I consider myself to democratic. I am
approachable and relatable as a leader. I hope for those I met with
that was apparent. I also will make sure I meet with all of you all if
I were to be elected.
Alex: As Speaker, you would be giving up your ability to debate in
Senate. What is in your opinion more important about you being
Speaker versus having your voice in debate?
Noah: I met with NCDC and asked if they thought my voice was
better served as a Senator or Speaker, and they fully supported me
in running. I think as Speaker you serve all student constituencies.
I speak up when it is necessary and having that type of awareness I
think if I would be elected.
Harrison: I get so much out of Senate by just listening. Also, so
much of what gets done in Senate takes place on committees. I am
confident that Kemper will be able to find a senator that is engaged
and want to help out.
Julia: Can you talk about your experience on a committee will help?
Harrison: I worked on the dining hall working committee. I learned
a lot about Sodexo and the inner workings. I think I would be able
to bring to the Speaker role the skills I learned about working and
talking with administrators.
Noah: I have had 2 main projects with PR. In fall, I helped rewrite
what is going on the rejuvenation ASG website. I had to gather
information about all committees, so I feel like I better understand
them now. In the winter, I worked on the faculty roundtables.
These are pretty intimate settings, and I helped facilitate and

moderated discussion with students and administrators. So, on a
micro scale, I have already moderated student discussion.
Adam: What is your experience with reaching out to the
Northwestern student body?
Noah: I work with a group that helps bring to the surface on the
political issue of the Palestinian and Israeli war. I have taken the
lead on student outreach with that. I have done PR and student
outreach for Mayfest. I worked with sponsorships that students
were looking for and what special events students were looking for.
I love to talk and would love to reach out to students.
Harrison: Last year, I was involved was in Student Life committee. I
also ran for SLVP. During the process, I got the great privilege of
being able to meet with student groups. I got a lot of feedback and
Anna has done a great job working on those issues. I am in a
fraternity, College Republicans, and NUSPAN.
Alex: How good are you guys with names?
Harrison: I am pretty good with names.
Noah: I am pretty good with names. As people are transitioning, I
will make sure that I know people’s names.
Alex: Motion to extend question period by 5 minutes.
Senator: 2nd
[vote passes]
Jacob: In one sentence, what is the most important aspect of being
Speaker?
Noah: To ensure that democracy is met by the Senate body and
that we reach to students.
Harrison: To engage the Senators and the entire northwestern
student body to make sure that they know they are apart of
something bigger than (LISTEN)
Wendy: What will you do to engage senators?
Harrison: I think Senate is an addendum to ASG and the juice we
do besides that. I think working with Senators with what they are
passionate about and be a resource to do what they want.
Noah: I agree with Harrison. I would meet with all new and old
senators. Also, once a month I would like to carve out caucus time
for senators to meet with their committee VP to work on legislative

work they can do for their committee in Senate. I would also be
interested in trying to bring an aspect of Caucus projects back.
• Parag: Speaker serves as a moderator and voice of Senate? What
do you bring as a voice of Senate?
• Noah: I was on the debate team, I also served as a secretary in
high school, I also am the brotherhood chair of Delta Tau Delta. I
have the ability to figure out what the voice of Senate is and bring
that to the exec board and greater Northwestern.
• Harrison: I think being a voice of you all is one of the most
important roles. I think through engagement and meetings and
being a proactive resource is the best way to represent your voice.
I think my caucus has come a huge way this year, and seeing we
had so many freshman, I am so happy with the engagement level
we were able to develop. I am confident so many of you continuing
on next year.
• Katie: I am very pleased to announce that the new Speaker of the
Senate is Noah Star.
General Order: Parliamentarian Election
• Katie: Next up is Parliamentarian. I am opening up the floor for
nominations.
• Grace: I nominate Dana.
• Dana: I accept. I nominate Petros.
• Petros: I accept.
• Katie: Anyone else? I close the nomination floor. You can give an
introductory speech.
• Petros: I am Senator for Rainbow Alliance and Student Groups
Caucus. I became a senator beginning of last year. I was Plex
Senator and now I am Rainbow Alliance Senator. I am Student
Group Caucus Whip for the past year. I was originally a written in
candidate last year, so I was not able to join a committee. I joined
a bunch of ad hoc and working committees, such as dining hall and
gun control. I was then able to join Rules in Spring. I love Rules so
much I brought it back to my exec board on Rainbow Alliance
reforming the constitution twice. Being in the Parliamentary body, I
have interacted a lot with Abby and Katie. I would be able to bring
to the table experience and passion.

Dana: I am a junior and currently the most senior member of
Rules. I have been elected for 3 years now. I have served as a fillin Parliamentarian a few times now as well. Whatever I am involved
in, I really try to dedicate myself to. I wasn’t planning on running,
as I nominated Petros, because I am Election Commissioner. I am
very interested in being Parliamentarian, and I don’t think it is an
issue of doing both jobs, but that is for you all to decide.
• Alex: What is your favorite rule?
• Dana: I have been asked this a lot. I am a big fan of personal
privileges.
• Petros: My favorite is motion to amend for everyone to add in their
idea to improve legislation. My least favorite is point of clarification.
• Dana: Also, asked and answered is not a thing.
• Lauren: Point of personal privilege. What is that?
• Katie: Anything that is not pertinent to senate business.
• Alex: What does Parliamentarian do that you don’t see in Senate
and why would you be good at it?
• Petros: Parliamentarian collects all legislation, and in Rules the
Parliamentarian can call in authors to work with them to improve
legislation and clarify.
• Dana: I would say that a really important part of being
Parliamentarian is being an institution of memory for the Code and
ASG as a whole. One thing I have noticed that Abby has done is
working with authors to help prepare them for questions and
Senate before they get here. I would like to continue that.
• Abby: I am excited to announce my successor is Petros.
General Order: Code Review
• Abby: A lot of the changes are formatting changes and grammatical
errors. These were the more major changes that we made to the
code as a committee. I’ll walk you through them now. The word
undergraduate was missing when referring to substitutes. We
explained what would be an excused absence in committee
meetings, so we clarified for Senate as well. We changed the
makeup of the Student Group Apportionment Committee, by
removing the EVP and the Caucus Whips. We removed Rules going
over the election guidelines.
•

Alex: Why did you remove caucus whips?
Abby: We had low turnout of the committee. We were able to
record meetings, but ten people is hard to coordinate. Because the
Speaker is the voice of Senate on all committees, the Senate is
reflected.
• Lauren: Who else sits on it?
• Abby: Chief of Staff, Speaker of the Senate, FVP, VP of SG, VP of
SA, and Parliamentarian.
• Katie: We are now in line for a vote. All those in favor? Any
opposed? Any abstaining? They passed.
New Business: SR1314-10: Oops!...They Did It Again
• Anna: This resolution was brought in light of the SafeRide changes
to no long offer off campus to off campus rides. About an hour ago,
the petition had over 450 signatures.
• Haley: We are asking the administration to look back on
transportation as whole and how to fill in the current gaps.
• Katie: Questions?
• Dana: Have you talked with SafeRide?
• Haley: I have a meeting set up as of today.
• Anna: I have talked to JPK and PTI and they said that the biggest
issue with SafeRide currently was wait time. And they saw this as a
solution.
• Jane: Would you be opposed to moving this to old business?
• Anna: No.
• Jane: Motion to make this old business.
• Senator: 2nd
[vote passes]
• Katie: Okay this is now old business. Questions?
• Alex: So theoretically, as an off campus resident, can I call a
SafeRide for a ride to on campus and then call another one to go off
campus?
• Haley: Yes, I guess so.
• Alex: So we would actually be increasing the amount of SafeRides
being requested.
•
•

Lauren: In caucus, we talked about this being a concerned of
students going for bar to bar. But this is really an issue of wait
time?
• Anna: That is a concern as well. But SafeRide is not allowed to drop
you off or pick you up at a bar. Wait time was the biggest point for
this change, but I am sure it is then solving that problem as well.
• Petros: Is this an issue of working with Evanston and SafeRides
disrupting them or replacing their taxi services?
• Haley: I know SafeRide has worked in ordinance with Evanston.
• Katie: Any more questions? Okay we will move to debate.
• Alex: Motion to amend.
• Katie: Okay what is it?
• Alex: Whereas, this new policy change may create a perverse
incentive to double the number of SafeRide requests;
• Senator: 2nd
[amendment passes]
• Senator: PQ
• Senator: 2nd
[passes]
Good of the Order & Announcements
• Dana: The campaign period starts in 15 minutes so get excited. The
EVP and President debates will be on Monday at 7 and 8pm in Swift
107.
• Katie: If you guys go to my Facebook profile, my cover photo is an
advertisement for the summer program engage Chicago.

Rafael: I just finished up apps for exec applications for all the cabinet positions.
Apply from the website starting tomorrow.

o

Alex: Apps for my SGC is going out tomorrow. Apply if you are interested. We help
recognize the B- and T-status groups on campus to make sure they are the best
they can be. If this sounds like you are interested, please reach out to me. We will
be filling at least 14-16 spots. And at least half have to be current or prior Senators.
We are also doing annual review right now.

o

Noah: We starting righting transition reports. Both unofficial guides will be

committee will probably be soft recruiting in the Spring.

IV.

General Order: Announcement of Election Results
o

Dana: As you may have seen on social media, our new President and EVP are Julia
Watson and Erik Zorn. I also would like to congratulate everyone who worked on a
campaign. It was a violation free campaign, which has never happened before.

[Abby Administers Oath]

o

[Abby’s Speech]

Special Order: Big Ten on the Hill
o

Noah: So now, Big Ten on the Hill.

o

Chris: Laptops?

o

N: No.

o

Kevin: Sent delegation to DC. These are the people who went. There for
Association of Big Ten students. First time we have been there in a number of
years. Great opportunity. Meetings we had, here we go!

o

Rebecca: Senior in ASG and on CRC. First day, we went to the white house
outreach office, and met with someone in charge of youth outreach and told us
what is on the president's agenda. Went to the CFPB, created after financial crisis
to ensure consumer protections, including students. Cool to know that government
is looking out for us. We received personal emails later.

o

Kevin: Want to continue working.

o

R: Went to Education Department and Civil rights dept. New ratings system to be
instituted for all colleges. Talked about sexual assault through Civ Rights Dept. We
asked questions, got a lot of feedback. Focused a lot on sexual assault. Also went to
a Title IX speech and learned a lot from fellow students about T9 issues.

o

K: Went to various meetings and broke up into groups. Rep Schneider (Highland
Park). Then met with Sen. Dick Durbin's office. Then Sen. Kirk's office, and met him
in person. Then went to Danny Davis' office. And finally with Rep. Schakowsky.

o

Liz: Talked about a lot of issues like mental health, higher education act, sexual
assault with many members of Congress and the federal government.

o

K: Glad we got to talk with a lot of people about these issues. Encourage y'all to
stay up to date on issues relevant to college students, and bring them up.

o

Ani: We did talk about many of the college issues, as well as initiatives individual
campuses like our own have enacted. Used to encourage federal government to act
federally on these issues. No university has violated T9 egregiously enough to get
government punishment. Many T9 cases have been settled. We want transparency.

o

K: We backed many bills like Rep J's mental health bill and Sen Durbin's textbook
affordability law.

o

C: We could talk more. But we want to hear questions.

o

Lauren: Any talk on streamlining FAFSA?

o

Ani: Yes, met with CFPB to streamline FAFSA and make it more used.

o

C: Higher Ed Act is very large bill. FAFSA reform will take place, likely next year.

o

A: Will extend FAFSA for another year.

o

Evan: College ranking system?

o

Liz: Very interesting. They were honest and were unsure on how it was going to be
used. Uncertainty on graduation rates, sexual assault, tuition, and they will take
suggestions on how to create the rankings and decide its use.

o

C: Right now, it’s a grand vision. Long term hope to roll out to wider audience and
find out how to holistically rank colleges and allow people to see if they are getting
value out of their education. Talked to Gallup, and they said data needed doesn't
exist yet and will need to be collected. Financial aid will be tied to these rankings
eventually, probably by 2018. Two years before they would even sanction a
university after receiving their initial rank.

VIII.

Special Order: ASG Hackathon
o

Noah: Hackathon?

o

Sofia: Yeah we're going to do a quick presentation.

o

Christine: Hackathon will be on the 25th and 26th.

o

Steven: API is way to program apps and websites in order for people to receive
data. CAESAR and Wildcat Connection API will be released for this hackathon in
order to allow students to develop these services. Goal is to ensure that our tech
services are not continuously … crappy.

o

Sofia: So, here's the website. Lists the prizes, etc.

o

C: We will have judges to select winners, 2000 for first, 1000 for second. Students
will also select their best, and 2000/1000 will also be up for grabs. Emerging
underclassmen award of 500 dollars.

o

S: This is for programmers, graphic designers, and all kinds of students. Sponsored
by the project pool, and has a ton of sponsors with lots of support from campus.
Lots of support from alums, which is super cute. This is the first time we have had a

hackathon. We hope whatever is developed out of it will benefit the campus at
large. You will be getting an email, and I encourage you all to participate and show
up and support your peers. Event will take place in Norris.

IX.

o

Wendy: Will people have teams already, or will they be placed in teams?

o

C: Both

o

Lauren: How many people per team?

o

C: Up to 6

o

ASA: [no idea]

o

S: Only class information will be available. No personally identifying information.

o

D: [unsure]

o

C: No coding experience needed. All levels encouraged.

o

Chris: Target for people.

o

C: 100 people.

o

C&S: Take flyers.

General Order: SAFC Confirmations
o

Noah: OK SAFC confirmations.

o

Mackenzie: We are just filling vacancies now. Is not normal recruitment.

o

Candidate: Served as PR VP for McSA. Involved with NU World Cup. I think that I
have an area of expertise that people can benefit from.

o

Justin: I've been a B- status and A status treasurer before. Know SOFO and have
been through many funding processes. I know how groups acquire SAFC money.
Dealt with Amrit, and he's wonderful, and want to give my knowledge back.

o

C: Majoring in EECS. Been part of numerous communities across campus the past
two years. Been part of Wildcat Welcome, NESBE, etc. SAFC affects community at
large. I enjoy the community here, and hope to bring that as an AE.

o

John: Time conflicts?

o

C: This would be my main commitment for the upcoming year. Not on McSA
anymore. This would take center stage.

o

J: Serve on my theatre board. B-status and not a large class load. Can manage it.

o

C: Will not be on other exec boards next year. Work at Norris should not interfere.

o

Eliza: Are these just for vacancies?

o

M: Yes.

o

Chris: So this would only be for 1-2 months?

o

M: Yup.

o

Noah: Questions?

o

Noah: OK, exit the room for debate period.

o

Noah: You know the drill.

o

Chris: Why are these the best?

o

M: We are losing a lot of great members. They each represent a unique section of
the campus, and some of these areas are underrepresented. They represent a large
spectrum that will bring a lot of light to complaints from these groups and their
needs.

Noah: Other stuff.

o

Senator: PQ. 2nd.

o

Chris: White ballot [passes]

o

Noah: All in favor? [Passes by voice vote].

General Order: Community Engagement Grant
o

Noah: Isaac?

o

Isaac: CEG is in its 2nd year and is a 500-dollar grant for NU students to do
programming or things to improve our relationship with Evanston.

o

Steven: Very specific...

o

Isaac: Thank you. [Laughs]. We had 17 apps, up from 12 last year. Went through
multiple rounds to select the finalists. We did this via a committee with me, Chris,
Charlise Agnew, Tony Kirchmeier, Kevin, etc. We are recommending the three:
Zuze, NU Mini Chefs, and Supplies for Dreams. I will outline the line items.

o

Isaac: 300 for NU Mini Chefs. They work with students in Albany Park to learn how
to cook healthy and good food. This money will allow them to expand into
Evanston.

o

Kevin: Charlise was passionate about this, and will take advantage of civic centers.

o

I: Confident they will do good work. 100 dollars for Zuze. Make sandwiches for
Evanston homeless people. Will do good for us, Evanston, and many other people.

o

K: Program run from Hillel. Will help with some of their operating costs.

o

I: Yeah, it’s for PB, J and bread. SfD is recommended 100 dollars to make backpacks
with supplies for underprivileged students in the area. They want to reach out to
Evanston more this year.

o

K: Other Evanston organizations want to tie in with the city via SfD. This year, CEG
focused more on Evanston rather than Chicago. We had to narrow it to Evanston,
because there were so many good groups to fund. We will follow up with the
groups we did not fund, in order to see if there's any way we can help them or find
outside funds.

o

I: Groups were given Charlise Agnew's information to follow up.

o

K: Questions?

o

N: Alex?

o

Alex: PBJ not most nutritious.

o

I: Sandwiches are supplement to food already given out at shelters.

o

A: Have they considered other options?

o

Chris: Our job is not to critique their operations. We just want to engage students.

o

John: Zuze does a small thing, but plays a critical role.

o

John 2: Backpacks stuffed with what?

o

Committee: School supplies.

o

Noah: Cool. Seeing no other questions…

o

Chris: So we actually need you guys to approve this, even though it is allocated for
in the budget.

o
XI.

Noah: We will now move to a vote. [passes by voice vote]

New Business: SL1314-26: Promoting Student Activism on Sexual Assault Policies
o

Noah: Authors you can come up.

o

Kevin: Something we put together earlier this week out of our briefing with the
Know Your Title IX group in D.C. This has been a pertinent issue on our campus,
and some groups have already been engaging. This is a national issue. This goes
beyond the Ludlow issue, and Obama already made a task force on the issue of
sexual violence in order to draft recommendations. White House asked us for ideas
and our feedback. 1 in 5 college females has been affected.

o

Ani: Background on efforts thus far. We have had some members of Exec working
with other students on T9 case. We want to bring those efforts to the forefront and

gain momentum on them. Multiple student groups and offices working on it. We
want to create this forum, and want to ensure this issue doesn't fall of the radar
during the summer. We want to engage with this issue in a long-term format. We
don't want to be the experts on the matter, so this bill authorizes the exec board to
take action and bring back some recommendations in 3 weeks to Senate. We want
to have an outline of a plan for what we and NU can do. Could take 6, 12, 18
months, totally up to you and our partners.
o

Liz: We discovered over the weekend that many colleges have great policies and
groups, but many students are unsure of what they are entitled to when assault
happen. Enforcement of T9 is not as stringent as it should be. We want to ensure
people know their Title IX rights.

o

Ani: Kind of like alcohol policy here was unclear a few years ago, and has been
clarified now. We want to ensure in the past that no one's T9 rights haven't been
violated, and will not in the future.

o

K: First step. We are looking forward to see what we can do.

o

Noah: Questions? Alex?

o

Alex: What will happen if you get stonewalled due to the current court case?

o

Ani: We do not expect that to happen. Administration is willing to work with us. We
want to clarify how the policies will work for us in the future. Answers have been
satisfactory, but we want to know more.

o

Alex: How does this take transitions into account?

o

K: Entire exec board has been currently working on this.

o

Alex: What changes when this bill passes?

o

Ani: This is ideally something that the Executive Board comes to Senate and asks
can we start doing this. Usually the executive board comes to Senate and asks what
can we do. This is a much more concrete issue.

o

Alex: Motion to move this to Old Business.

o

Petros: Any objections?

o

Petros: Old Business. And now Noah will take over.

o

Noah: And now we are in debate.

o

Stephen: Motion to amend?

○ A: About 60 million a year, most of it comes from parking and ticket sales. We provide a
need portion of the financial aid for athletes
○ Q: Increased funding for transportation.
A: Yes, it is dear to my heart. I actually had a large role in creating the shuttles
Senate Minutes Page 1

○ A: Yes, it is dear to my heart. I actually had a large role in creating the shuttles
originally. Intercampus was created to encourage people to go into Chicago. Also,
frostbite shuttles are not the best, but we are tied financially to increase
transportation. But we sympathize greatly with transportation issues from students
and faculty, and we are as responsive as we can.
○ Q: Penalty for shuttles being late/not arriving?
○ A: We try to monitor it. It is not a perfect system.
○ Q: Does 60 million for athletics count facilities?
○ A: No, it covers the operating budget. Constructing the facilities are handled in a
different line items. Usually funded by gifts.
○ Q: Priority for unrestricted gift?
○ A: Determined by President, although large gifts can be put into endowment by the
Board of Trustees. Often these are put into areas such as undergraduate financial aid
and graduate fellowships.
○ Q: Proposals for eliminating tuition and basing cost off of percentage of family income?
○ A: We have looked at that, and model multiple different scenarios such as that one.
Difficult to eliminate tuition unless there is a very large endowment. Only 3-4 schools
have this amount, and the Board and University are very interested in it.
○ Q: What can undergraduates do to influence budget?
○ A: Budget ultimately rests in Board of Trustees. But we do try and include students
whenever possible.

the projects we have accomplished this year. For improvement, I want to ensure that
we have representation at City Council meetings and at Evanston events.
○ Q: Grand visions for projects for next year?

VII. General Order: Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion Confirmation
○ Austin Romero presented as nominee for Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion
○ Austin provides speech outlining intentions for VP of D/I, as well as background &
experience
○ Q: More detail on your platform based on dialogue?
○ A: Sure! It is different from debate. Point is to understand why people think and feel
certain ways. Listening to the perspective of others is important to grow as people.
ASG, as representative of this university, is embedded in the student body here, and
a lot can be accomplished
○ Q: Speak more to your time in Sustained Dialogue?
○ A: A lot of time that conflict occurs is when two points clash with each other.
Moderators step in and mediate, so that we can understand experiences and feelings,
not to start debate based on ideology. Dialogue is on personal experience, not
generalizations. Can be iffy at times, but always gets brought back to attempts to
learn.
○ Q: What communities would you seek to work with next year?
○ A: A number of different ones. I would like to plan a weekend in winter to bring
student leaders together to have a dialogue and conversation on their experiences
and perspectives. These leaders can then bring their knowledge they acquired back
to their groups.
○ Q: How will you translate the SD experience from a small group to over 8,000
undergraduates?
A: I really want to spend fall quarter discussing with committee and groups, and
Senate Minutes Page 2

○ A: I really want to spend fall quarter discussing with committee and groups, and
digging at the roots of problems emerging from issues of diversity and inclusion. We
need to define the problem first.

the D/I committee this past year?

engagement with the community.

○ Christina Cilento presented as the nominee for Vice President for Sustainability.
○ Christina gives a speech highlighting her background, and goals for the future.
○ Wes provides endorsement and speech describing Christina's qualifications for the
positions.
○ Q: How to plan to engage students?
○ A: Hard to get students to care, I acknowledge that. Want to present awareness of
how sustainability affects campus in all types of ways, cutting across groups, majors,
etc. We definitely need an interdisciplinary approach, and give students more
opportunities to get involved.
○ Q: How would you address sustainability in the Greek community?
○ A: I live up in the Greek Quad. Yes, there does need to be more recycling bins campus
wide, and in that quad. I am open to that idea, and others you all may have.
○ Q: What is your opinion on the administration's response to sustainability?
○ A: Admin can be good in some areas, not others. Newly renovated buildings are being
LEED certified, but some will not get there anytime soon. I've worked on the
divestment campaign this past year, and we need to pressure the administration to
act.
○ Q: Ideas on getting solar panels on campus?
○ A: ESW is working on wind energy, as well as solar, and we are definitely supportive
of that. I would leave that project specifically to them, but am supportive of all forms
of renewable energy. Geothermal energy will be done at new visitor's center. We
definitely should keep pushing for it.
○ Q: Plans to do things that are less campus specific, for example, fracking in Illinois?
○ A: Would focus primarily on Northwestern issues. Divestment is good example of a
larger national movement, and we would certainly consider getting a group together
to push for certain issues.
○ Debate Period
 Pro (5)
 Con (0)
 Endorsements from both NU community members and Senators.
○ Christina Cilento confirmed unanimously as Vice President for Sustainability for the
2014-15 term.

X. General Order: Vice President of Services Confirmation
○ Christina Kim presented as nominee for Vice President for Services.
○ Christina gives speech discussing intentions for the Services VP position, as well as
her experience.
○ Q: Goals for the following year?
○ A: Have committee discuss as whole what services are most needed for the NU
community.
○ Q: How will you increase interest in already existing Services projects?
○ A: We should look at why other methods are more desirable, and seek to improve our
services based on that.
○ Q: Can you explain your collaboration with other departments, like EECS?
○ A: We definitely want to seek to promote their ideas, as well as ours.
○ Q: What did Noah did well, what do you want to better?
○ A: Noah has been very good at having good discussions and being available. I would
like to have more of a model, rather than more scattered ideas for what services we
should pursue.
○ Debate Period
 Pro (8)
 Con (1)
 Endorsements by both NU community members and Senators
○ Christina Kim confirmed by Senate as the Vice President for Services for the
2014-15 term.

you, others, and ASG."

 "There are some things that suck about NU and ASG. I will not list them here.

bottom of my heart."

Chris Harlow presented as the nominee for Vice President for Student Life.
Chris gives a speech articulating his experience and intentions for the SLVP position.
Anna gives her thoughts about her confidence in Chris to be the new SLVP.
Q: Top goal for next year?
A: Doesn't exist. I have multiple. I want to accomplish as much as I can.
Q: Do you like the current structure of Student Life Committee?
A: I want to meet with Anna and Alex, to do a good review of the past few years. I
would prefer a hybrid director position, that is still accountable to the VP and to their
committee members.
Q: What are your ideas on mental health?
A: It has been an issue for a long time. It's important that we get ASG to act on it. We
need to work with Julia and Erik to see how to interact better with the mental health
community. Specific points: lack of resources to get their message out, need to use
ASG as platform to broadcast their initiatives rather than create our own campaigns,
etc. Mental health days, maybe? Much more we can do.
Q: What has Anna done well, what would you do differently?
A: Anna has done an amazing job, and had lists upon lists of issues to work on. She has
had that challenge, and grew the committee to work on those. I would improve by
changing the structure of the committee. Anna is great at interacting with
administrators, and I definitely want to get better at that.
Q: Concerned on your platform, as there is no mention of student safety?
A: I have included it under other categories. Transportation, as well as apps to have
safe walks. It might have been an oversight on my part. But I do acknowledge we
need to pressure NU administration and Evanston to guarantee safety.
Debate Period
 Pro (7)

A: 2900 dollars.
Q: What groups have you reached out to?

Motion to old business. It passes. Will be heard after SL1314-27.

Motion to amend, to reduce amount to 300.
Motion seconded.

A: Not for honorarium. Only for flight and accomodations.
Con speech given urging to decide only on merits.
Pro given stating that speakers do not need that large of an honorarium, given that
they are supported by a large organization.
Point of information: are you a recognized group on campus?
A: We are B-status.
Con given stating that honorariums are negotiable only to a point. We need to decide
on merits, as this will benefit students.
Have actively sought out other funding. That is commendable. A lot of people seek to
benefit from this.
Pro: great event, I would like to see it happen. However, I still believe there are a lot
of funding sources, and ASG doesn't need to be the sole contributor.
Con: Setting aside personal beliefs, we need to evaluate based on need. Deadline is
next week, which might show lack of preparedness. Perhaps ASG has not been super
clear as to the process of sending legislation.
Motion to extend Senate by 30 minutes. Passes.
Amendment fails.
Previous question, seconded w/o objection.
SL1314-28 passes.

XIV. New Business: SR1314-11 Bottle Water Free Northwestern
○ Authorship speech given by Pura Playa.
○ Q: More water bottle refilling stations?
○ A: That is one of our largest initiatives. Fountains that need maintenance will be
automatically upgraded to those new fountains. We will push for more.
○ Q: Timeframe?
○ A: After resolution passes, we are going to meet with Julie Payne-Kirchmeier to
determine feasibility and plan on phasing out bottled water gradually.
○ Q: Is this only for selling in C-Stores and vending machines, or also to prevent
reimbursing water? Coke contract?
○ A: Yes it is. We are not pushing very hard on banning reimbursements. Following
WashU model, and Coke contract is not a huge obstacle.
○ Q: Will this extend to the Chicago campus/Kellogg?
○ A: We are focusing on Evanston C-stores and vending machines for now. Allen
Center is already bottled water free. NU is already on the path.
○ Noah: Great. We will see this as old business next week.

Q: Spoon's readership?
A: 3000 printed, 2900 were distributed.
Q: Mockup of the advertisement?
A: Current JobCat logo, with a slogan.
Q: Why is this ad necessary, as opposed to other traditional advertising methods?
A: We have used other methods, such as copy sleeves in C-stores, but we were
hoping that this would increase viewership and get JobCat's name out.

6. Old Business: SR1314-11 Bottle Water Free Northwestern
○ Authorship speech provided by authors from Pura Playa
○ Q: Why do you feel this method of seeking a resolution is better than a referendum
like at Harvard?
○ A: Student affairs stated this would be the best way forward to prove it to the
administration that there is student support.

Then, hopefully pass this resolution and talk to JPK. Modify contract and phase out
bottled water by April 2015.

○ A: Putting more water bottle stations with cups next to them, as well as having water
carafes instead of bottled water at events. Definitely feasible given these school's

7. New Business: ASG Operating Budget
○ Erik, Julia, and Budget Committee present speech explaining the 2014-15 Operating
Budget.
○ Q: Why did you allocate as much as you did to the Student Leadership Fund and ASG
Fund, respectively?
○ A: Pilot program for the SLF. We want that to be the one that exists long term. ASG
Fund will pay for part of the Work Study for ASG Exec.
○ Q: Proportional reasoning for ASG compared to SLF?
○ A: SLF is pilot program, and we need to get that off the ground before we hopefully
get to increase it overall.
○ Q: Would SARC have veto power over ideas that come to Wild Ideas Fund?
○ A: More that Serene and her committee would work to determine logistics rather
than veto ideas.
○ Q: How many people will be selected in the SLF?
○ A: CSI and Financial Aid would determine that.
○ Q: Clarify amount for ASG fund and SLF?
○ A: 10 thousand is given as pilot, mainly to track it easier and determine feasibility.
ASG one is more of a supplement to Work Study. We want to see how SLF works so
that we can hopefully grow the fund significantly. ASG Fund, we do not see as
needing as drastic an expansion.
○ Q: Marketing for the WIF?
○ A: 10K marketing was highly successful, and we want people to know about this on a
quarterly basis and increase events on campus rather than little things.
○ Q: Election materials?
○ A: We will now give the money, as well as paper and chalk rather than have a cap on
spending like we do now.
○ Q: Why only leadership positions in SLF?
○ A: Time allotted, as well accountability.
○ Q: Would SLF be available to Greek Executive board members?
○ A: No differentiation, beyond need-based criteria.
○ Q: How do you see individual students using WIF in order to present an idea?
○ A: Senate would get to decide, and SARC would just make sure all the logistics are in
line, like having a SOFO account.
○ Q: What outreach has been done to administrators?
○ A: Met with CSI, Patricia Telles-Irvin, and others and there is wide support for the
Events Fund, as well as the SLF and ASG Fund.

○ Patrick Leonard and Eliza Abramson give authorship speech.
○ Q: Does it cost that much to make these letters?

○ A: No, but it's a really cool idea and initiative. We will be able to reuse these.
○ Q: What is your preference for the items?
○ A: Order listed in agenda?
○ Q: Storage?
○ A: Storage is in Norris?
○ Q: Costs for art competition?
A: To the artists and for materials.
Senate Minutes Page 2

9. New Business: SL1314-29 Making Pre-Med Better: Peer Advising
○ Riko Ohashi and Steven Bennett give authorship speech.
○ Q: Any information on GSW and their initiatives?
○ A: GSW is more for tutoring and assistance, not mentoring.
○ Q: Why is premed advising different than for instance, pre-business mentoring that is
predicated on helping younger students?
○ A: Not all students in the current organizations or resources in order to mentor all
pre-medical students.
○ Q: But if only 8 mentors will be provided, with 2-3 people, 16-24 people is exclusive,
is it not?
○ A: It's a pilot program.
○ Q: How do you see this program being sustained in the future?
○ A: We hope one of the organizations that currently exist will take over/
○ Q: How do you plan to market?
○ A: Email, chalking, flyering, etc.
○ Q: How do you plan on training?
○ A: Meetings planned before mentoring starts, with some organizational support, but
we will also be looking for experienced students.
○ Q: Is monetary incentive necessary at all?
○ A: We see this as necessary to incentivize good mentoring.
10. New Business: SL1314-30 Supercharging SASA’s Spring Concert
○ Parag Dharmavarapu and Naveen Reddy give authorship speech.
○ Q: What day will this be?
○ A: Venue is booked for 5/23.
11. New Business: SL1314-31: Funding for Senior Year Experience
○ Romain Sinclair presents authorship speech.
○ Q: All of these items are donated to you, correct?
○ A: Correct.
○ Q: Why aren't the fund available to you anymore?
○ A: The leader moved back to Hong Kong and we did not receive the grant this year.
○ Q: Is this mainly undergraduates?
○ A: They are the focus, but it is not exclusive.
○ Q: We don't have 5000
○ A: I'm not going to get 5000, obviously. I think it highlights how badly we need it and
how important I think this is. We really need that money and 5000 is a small chunk of
how much money we will save students.
Q: How will you sustain this in the future?
Senate Minutes Page 3

○ Q: How will you sustain this in the future?
○ A: What this is really is a cash flow issue. We will be collecting from students and
then selling it in September. Right now we need money to make it happen originally.
We've learned a lot in our second year. We donated far too much money to charities,
but our business is sustainable. We made a positive margin.
○ Q: What other funding sources have you approached?
○ A: We've looked into grants and we've reached out to sustainability groups at
Northwestern.
○ Q: You only sell items in the fall?
○ A: We sell them when students come back to campus. Late August to mid September.
12. New Business: SL1314-32 NUAsian Magazine
○ Kenny Mok and others make authorship speech.
○ Kenny: Hey guys, my name is Kenny and I am the Senator for Asian interest student
groups.
○ Kevin, NUAsian: NUAsian is one of the few print magazines for minority students.
We recently had a great issue about south asians, we covered the recent Miss
America. We usually only print two times, but this year we decided to print three,
because issues ran out at the launch party. A common question ASG asks is if we've
exhausted all sources. We have. We've gone to all internal and outside sources.
Finding sources for funding journalism organizations is incredibly hard.
○ Q: Normally, magazines raise money from ads. Do you do this?
○ A: We do, but it's not a super efficient way of getting money. Because we are Asian
interest, the business are mainly Asian interest businesses. There are only so many
you can get around to. The difference between us and other publications is that the
Daily and NBN print continuously.
○ Q: 700 or 800?
○ A: 800
○ Q: What is your long term plan for keeping this sustainable?
○ A: Grants when they see we can do this.
○ Alex: Would ASG get recognition?
○ Q: Will you be able to print in the future without this money?
○ A: No, we will not be able to, at least not as we have in the past.
○ Q: Distribution?
○ A: Tech, Library, multiple off campus locations, etc.
○ Q: Is NUAsian under APAC.
○ A: It is independent as of now.

12. New Business: SR1314-11: Supporting the Sheridan Road Bike Path
○ Wes Lien and Christina Cilento present authorship speech.
○ Q: So Evanston already has the money for this bike path?
○ A: Correct, it is scheduled for creation by 2015, but needs student support and NU
support.
○ Q: When is the next meeting between students and NU/Evanston officials?
○ A: Happen every month, but unsure when the next one will occur.
○ Q: Cost to implement the bike lane?
○ A: Unsure how the allocated amount of 1.5 million dollars will be allocated. Depends
on construction.
○ Q: Do you think having this be old business will be beneficial?

○ A: One year, and then a review will occur.
○ Q: Recruitment?
○ A: We will heavily recruit, and we are going to heavily publicize this.
○ Q: Why does this need to be separate?
○ A: Good question. We don't think having an assistant VP position is good, since it will
introduce more bureaucracy. It will interfere with discussion, and we need that chair
in meetings. We will only institutionalize this if it is successful, as determined by a
review.
Q: Will this person be on the Exec Board?

NUNights Grant?
○ A: As the new board, we will look into long-term sustainability and make a plan.
○ Q: What other places have you considered?
○ A: Parkes, Dittmar…
○ Q: To clarify, I meant funding sources?
○ A: Jewish studies, etc.
○ Q: Will you be lifting anyone in a chair? Will they be 13 or 15?
○ A: Last year, we had an 18 year old go through the process, but not 13 or 15.
○ Q: Date?
○ A: May 29.
○ Q: Can you hold the event without a DJ?
○ A: DJ is traditional for Bar/Bat Mitvah, and mariachi for quinceanera. Could be held
without it, but the event wouldn't be as good.
○ Q: What steps will you take to make the event sustainable, environmentally.
○ A: We can talk to JJ Java and see what we can do. We can try teracycling for number

Meeting of the Senate
May, 14, 2014
I. Call to Order and Roll Call
○ Senate called to order at approximately 7:06 PM.
II. Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
III. Executive Board Reports
IV. General Order: Visit from NU-Q
○ Q: What other schools besides School of Communication are at NU in Qatar?
○ A: Medill School of Journalism
○ Q: What projects have you done in the past?
○ A: We do a lot of cross-campus events and programming in Education City. We also

have sought to expand course offerings.
○ Q: What does your student government look like?
○ A: President, VP, Secretary, Treasurer, 2 Event Coordinators, and 2 Media

Coordinators. There are also two class representatives and 2 major representatives
for each class and major.
○ Q: What kind of events do you have?
○ A: Go Wild Week, dodgeball between faculty and students, Purple Fest, Media

Awards.
○ Q: What are you seeking to improve on for next year?
○ A: Lots of focus on events this past year, and we want to devote more time to issues

that the students encounter. Our new Executive Board will be meeting at the end of
May. Next year's government will focus on making sure students have their voices
heard. We want to make the transition smoother, that way the Government at NU-Q
continues to exist even when officers graduate.
Senate Minutes Page 1

continues to exist even when officers graduate.
○ Q: What else are you doing during your trip to Evanston?
○ A: 10 students have been here studying for the past two quarters. We also have a

group from the Class of 2016 visiting Evanston for the past week.
V. General Order: Funding Primer
○ Serene Darwish and Alex Van Atta give Funding tutorial presentation.
○ Q: Does any amount in the amendment pool not used get rolled over to the next

funding cycle?
○ A: Yes, it would roll over.
VI. Old Business: ASG Operating Budget
○ Erik Zorn and Julia Watson, on behalf of the Budget Committee, present the

2014-2015 ASG Operating Budget to Senate for consideration as Old Business.
○ Q: If support funds are provided for Work-Study, then what is the role of the federal

government here?
○ A: The federal government will not be involved, as the money will be completely

distributed by the university.
○ Q: What is the difference between ASG and SL fund, given they both draw from the

SAF?
○ A: ASG Fund is not growing, while Student Leadership fund will increase with time.
○ Q: If this is a pilot, will ASG have to contribute 10,000 dollars every year?
○ A: Similar model to the Student Internship Grant Program (SIGP). After a certain

period of time, it would be self-sustaining, and probably funded by the university
directly.
○ Q: So the SL Fund is a kickstarter, but is the ASG Fund seen as a recurrent line item?
○ A: Depends on financial need of the Executive Board in the given year. Over time, the

university will take over.
○ Q: How will officers be fired if they aren't doing their job?
○ A: Impeachment, as well as through other measures.
○ Q: How does ASG Fund affect Tech VP fund?
○ A: It replaces it, that way all positions are funded by need rather than financial merit

as an incentive.
○ Q: When the SL Fund begins next year, will it be just our 10K, or will the university

provide money right from the start?
○ A: It depends. We want to see the university raise money, and the new student

enrichment office will be tasked with increasing the funds for the SL Fund.
Q: Will the amount allocated to the ASG Fund be increased/decreased over time?
Senate Minutes Page 2

○ Q: Will the amount allocated to the ASG Fund be increased/decreased over time?
○ A: Yes, the amount is tied to internal research surveying financial need on the Board
○ Q: So this will theoretically increase to 5,000 dollars if 100 percent of the Board is on

work-study?
○ A: Yes, but this will never cover the full work-study stipend for students.
○ Q: Will removal of Technology VP stipend reduce recruitment for the position?
○ A: No, because it has been hard to recruit for that position regardless of if the stipend

is provided or not. This model makes more sense, because it takes need into
consideration.
○ Motion to Amend
 Recruitment from 500 to 400 dollars, Green Consulting from 2500 to 2000,

Conference from 1000 to 500, Wild Ideas from 25,000 to 20,000.

with Speaker to ensure equal distribution of Senators.
○ Q: No names on ballot, correct? Would you be open to requiring buildings have at

least one Senator?
○ A: Correct. However, I believe that proposal goes against the spirit of the bill.
○ Q: Do you see problems with certain districts like Plex with Seabury?
○ A: No, because we see that district as similar in character. Also, it is hard to get

candidates from certain districts, so we are trying to ensure we do not turn down
qualified candidates.
○ Q: Why does PMA get a Senator?
○ A: We struck that from the legislation. It was a mistake.
○ Q: Question on proposed District 1? Do you see Elder dominating the district, and

winning all three seats?
○ A: I can say two things. We would envision all Senators working together to split up

the district and understanding the views of all of the residents. This model will allow
you to sit on Exec Boards and be in close proximity to constituents.
○ Q: Do you have any idea how you will make district elections work?
○ A: We would need to have that determined by the Election Commission.
○ Q: Current idea that ASG does not represent students. Do you feel that students,

especially in smaller houses, could buy into that idea and make this misconception
worse?
○ A: Current model, you do not feel a close connection because of the distance

between buildings on campus. This model would make representation easier, and

between buildings on campus. This model would make representation easier, and
allow for a closer affiliation with ASG.
○ Q: What do you mean by central location?
○ A: It needs to be somewhere that is easily accessible by all students. Cannot be areas

that require key access.
○ Q: Would you encourage rotation of Senators?
○ A: Yes, that would be a great idea.
○ Q: RCB vets their Senators. Unsure on RHA. What would be the role of RCB in this

model?
○ A: We don't see RCB as necessary to look over Senators, and we see that as an area

that should be handled by ASG.
○ Q: What would be the experience of Senators going over to other hall governments?
○ A: I would say issues that are affecting your specific building are not necessarily

things you would bring to Senate. Those issues are best articulated to RHA, RCB, or
the administration.
○ Motion to Extend Question Period by 2 Minutes
 Passes
○ Q: At the moment, everyone has one Senator. With this model, where people would

now have multiple Senators, do you see an issue with representation?
○ A: An informal division of labor could solve a lot of those options.
○ Q: Do you think moving elections to Spring would be better?
○ A: We see the benefits, but we do not see it as something that would work well,

especially for RHA.
9. New Business: CTECs Working Groups
○ Anna Rennich and Steven Bennett present authorship speech.
○ Q: Why do you need three separate groups?

○ A: We want a wide swath of people, and we think a very large committee would be

inefficient. It's already hard enough to get all administrators together.
○ Q: How will committees be split?
○ A: 50/50.
○ Q: Plan for forming these groups?
○ A: We will send out emails to listservs and already have faculty that want to be

involved. We have people on Academic Committee that are interested.
○ Point of Parliamentary Inquiry: Do working groups need to be elected right after

passing legislation?

Not according to the Code, no.
Senate Minutes Page 3

 Not according to the Code, no.
10. New Business: A-Status Funding
○ McKenzie Schneider presents the SAFC Funding Recommendation for A-Status

Groups for Spring 2014.
○ Q: I am really awful with Excel. I'm looking at NCDC's funding right now. It says, "The

requested amount is less than…"
○ A: SOPE says that groups get a certain amount of money, standardized for certain

items. This is why you can be allocated more than what you requested.
○ Q: Why is travel not funded for some groups? Is it standardized?

○ A: Not standardized. Groups prioritize their requests, which is why we fund certain

items over other items. In some cases, we did take rollbacks into consideration, that
way we can maximize efficiency and allow funds to be utilized most effectively.
○ Q: Why is the amount for A&O Blowout provided in two different values.
○ A: President provides a gift to move the event to a certain venue. [Confusion]
○ Q: Are all of these line items going to happen?
○ A: Groups place fake names, since they cannot release specific names for events until

contracts are released. Those are placeholders. Also, to clarify, SAFC does not give
funds for new events. They may ask for it in supplemental.
○ Q: Are groups not allowed to put names of speakers on applications?
○ A: Yeah those are place holders.
○ Q: Are you allowed to put the specific name, if that person is definitely being

pursued?
○ A: We do not recommend groups do that.
○ Q: Can groups speak about desire to bring certain people?
○ A: I recommend no, because your group can be open to liability and misconduct.

Names should not be released until contracts are set up.
○ Q: Does SAFC have standardized amounts?
○ A: Yes, it does. We do not fund food, programs, disposables, etc.

• Katie: So we will be taking attendance at the beginning and end of
every Senate for Senators that are new. Also, let’s start with
Senator introductions. So, each Senator please stand up and say
your name, year, major and group you represent.
[Introductions]
• Katie: Now we will move into exec reports. This is all in the agenda.
Orientation on Sunday, location TBA. Committees will be

Caucus meetings. Think about it this next week and elections will be

starting as a Senator.
• Abby: Hi, I’m Abby and I am a senior studying mechanical
engineering. I am Parliamentarian, so I am in charge of all
legislation that comes through Senate and the ASG Code and
Constitution. Next week, we are actually holding Rules Committee
elections. I also serve as VP of Rules and the committee of 6
Senators helps me review legislation each week and upkeep the
Code and Constitution. It is a great chance to get involved so
consider running!
• Ani: I am Ani and President of ASG. I am a senior studying poly sci.
Please check out our exec board reports. We have a lot of great
information out there in them, so please take a look. We did have
an office renovation this summer, it is really nice, we are really

week to clear things up and then recruitment for it. The idea is that
10K will be used to make some idea brought to us by the students
happen. We have done 6 spots. 3 ASG and 3 not. We will take
suggestions during Fall, Winter quarter we narrow down to 6, and
then we have Senate vote on what will be sent out to campus.
Mark: I thought last year it was benches in general?
Alex: I think that was the wording.
Mark: I thought benches and tables were separate.
Petros: It was combined.
Alex: Yes it was combined and we will be placing the furniture in
the grassy area by Scott Hall. There is a lot going on. Go to Campus
Voice (web address). It is a great way to gauge what students
needs are. Welcome.
David: Hi, I am David Harris. 4th year studying econ. My job is to
recruit and train. Thank you for being here. For those veterans
here, I am recruiting for Operations for a few weeks. It will look
different and will be members that have already been in Senate
before.

health minor. Please look at my exec board report. Annually my
committee does a Faculty-Staff Honor Roll. How many of you know
what the Faculty Student Interaction Grant is? Okay so we will be
working in coordination with them more this year. The goal is to
build relationships between professors and students, so please be
on the lookout for that. I have also been working on communication
ties with Student Advisory Boards. We will also be sending out
survey on academics.
Siddiq: My name is Siddiq and I am a senior and head of SAFC. We
have our 2nd funding cycle coming up. And we have a open position
so please consider running.
Neel: I am Neel, SGVP. At the beginning of the quarter, all of our
groups are going through a quarterly review. We just finished up
and now we are going through roll backs, which is money that
wasn’t used that will be rolled back. It is basically when student
groups aren’t spending money, so we will have more money in our
pool soon.

Kevin: I am VP for CR. So as a recap, we just help Big Bite Night.
Great turnout and students groups performing was new. Cats
Coming to Dinner is coming soon too. We will be connecting
students with Evanston families. It will be happening end of
October. We will be having a light walk next week, so let us know
what areas you think are dark if you live off campus. Occupancy
reform, brothel law, is being reviewed by Evanston City Council. As
an update, it has been pushed back again. Hopefully it will be up in
November.
• Noah: Hi, I am Noah a junior and I am Services VP. We on services
start with a operating budget of $0 and come up with solutions for
student services ground up. We are working on the Unofficial Study
Abroad Guide. We are also working on the Unofficial Student Guide

Alex: We aren’t arguing about the bill tonight right?
Katie: Yes, tonight it is informational.
Carolyn: I am President of the Public Health Club. We are moving to
make NU a tobacco-free campus. It is a huge killer in America and
Illinois. Second hand and even third hand smoke is very dangerous.
There are 766 campus also making this move. It will benefit the
university financially and health-wise. It will cut down on littering,
health-care costs. So if you guys have any questions…?
Alex: How much weight would you say in cigarette liter is there?
Carolyn: I don’t know
Petros: Have you talked to the administration?
Carolyn: Yes, the administration passed a smoke-free bill. They
didn’t understand the difference between smoke-free and tobaccofree.
Mark: Can you explain the difference between smoke free and
tobacco free?
Carolyn: Yes there is a difference. This bill also includes ecigarettes. We are collecting all of this together.
Taylor: How will the university enforce this?
Carolyn: Signage and peer encouragement.
Taylor: What will consequences be?
Carolyn: Police can be involved, like they could maybe search
students if they found their activity to potentially be suspicious.
Petros: Will this just push smoking off campus?
Carolyn: That is a worry. But 70% of smokers do want to stop. And
there are statistics that prove that
Alex: Can you smoke while driving by?
Carolyn: Technically, I guess no.
Isaac: What is the current rule?
Carolyn: No smoking within 25 feet of ventilation and doorways and
in university buildings.
Harrison: If the language of the bill we pass and the Faculty Senate
differ, what will happen?
Carolyn: the Faculty Senate want to uphold the tobacco-free bill.
Senator: Why e-cigarettes?

Carolyn: There is empirical data that I have on hand, but I feel that
it should be included.
Melanie: Would there be tobacco-free products on campus?
Carolyn: NO
Alex: What would the implementation timeline be?
Carolyn: A couple of months.
Senator: So could students have cigarettes in their rooms?
Carolyn: Technically no, but that would be hard to track.
Mark: Who will be implementing this?
Carolyn: I don’t know yet, but we wanted to show support for this
from ASG first.
Mark: Should this be legislation so we can have action to help this?
Carolyn: I was told not to.
Sean: Can we explain the difference between Resolution and
Legislation?
Katie: A resolution calls for support and legislation calls for action to
be taken by ASG.
Arian: Does this to the possession of tobacco products, like if
someone had a pack of cigarettes in their pocket?
Carolyn: The whole campus would be tobacco free.
Arian: So would off campus students have to stash cigarettes
before coming on campus?
Carolyn: I don’t think that would be an issue.
Dillon: Why don’t you just make it for no use of tobacco on
campus?
Carolyn: It is a social norm change.
Petros: Do you have any statistics on use of tobacco on campus and
statistics of complaints of use.
Carolyn: I don’t think we have stats for complaints, but we do have
statistics for students who smoke.
Taylor: You said police officer like this because it gives them
greater right to search students?
Carolyn: It’s not to search students.
Taylor: So what are we doing for enforcement?
Carolyn: We won’t know that until further down the line.
Mark: Motion to extend questioning by 3 minutes.

Katie: Great let’s explain what this is. We have 10 minutes for
question period. And you can ask to extend the period by
motioning. The we will vote on it. For, against, or abstain. All in
favor? Opposed? Abstaining?
[passes by visual vote]
David: Are you familiar is with what COFHE is?
Carolyn: No
David: it is a collection of private schools that our administration
compares us to and looks to a lot for moves on issues like this.
What schools have adopted this sort of tobacco-free campus policy?
Carolyn: Some Harvard institutions, Stanford, and some others.
And a full list is online.
Mark: I have a question for Abby. Has this gone through Rules?
Abby: Yes. That is why it is here tonight.
Mark: Okay, we will talk.
Melanie: Have you talked to smokers about this?
Carolyn: Yes, and a lot of smokers are against this. But a lot of
smokers in the end are usually in support of moves like this
eventually.
Katie: Any more questions? Okay thanks Carolyn. This will be old
business next week and then we will vote on this.
New Business: Associate Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion
Selection Process Presentation
• Alex: Okay we are going to do a little presentation.
• Katie: Any questions about legislation really fast?
• Dylan: How many votes to make it pass?
• Katie: Majority.
• Alex: So AVP of D&I has been vacant since spring of 2013. Since
then we have really evaluated with our advisors, CoC, and others
on campus to really talk about what this position is. We went back
to the drawing board and kind of redefined the role better. You can
read this and there is a link in the agenda. What we want to
emphasize is that this position is simply a voice to Ani and I, and
we will be the ones speaking on these issues for ASG. They will
assist with me and Ani on projects relating to D&I. They will be
sitting on various committees that are pertinent to their role. There

is an Eva Jefferson day, an old ASG President in MLK Jr’s day, and
they will be working on that. It will function very similarly to Anna
and Sophia’s role where they sit on university committees that
relate to their role. Okay so qualifications. Most importantly,
experience in the related area. We want to see track record and
dedication to D&I on campus. Ability to work across various
communities. This position is open to anyone on campus, as long as
they meet the qualifications. If this is a passion of yours, please feel
free to apply.
Mark: Can you speak to the status of the group and how it will
factor into the process?
Alex: Sophia?
Sophia: We reached out to them over the summer and asked about
their projects. Some have left the committee, but are still working
on D&I issues. All have been reached out to though in the summer
and fall.
Mark: So there is a committee? Or would they have a recruitment
process?
Alex: Yes there will be a recruitment process after the selection of
the AVP. So this is brought to you, because when there is a
vacancy, the process that we are going to take to fill it must be
approved by Senate. There is a new selection committee, chaired
by Ani and David. I will sit on there, Anna, Sophia, Coalition of
Color co-chairs as non-voting members to share their thoughts.
Katie will also be on there. This mirrors what we did in spring.
Normally the outgoing member sits on there, but she has
graduated. Apps will be released tomorrow if passed. And then we
will use grassroots method to spread the word. Apps due next
Wednesday and approval will happen in 2 Wednesdays. Any
questions? I want this as clear as possible.
Elena: Are you going to be sending this out?
Katie: Yes it is linked in the agenda/
Alex: Also a lot of this will appear on the application.
Dylan: Is there written record of this?

Abby: Yes I am taking minutes. As Parliamentarian that is one of
my duties, and you can view the minutes that will be linked in next
week’s minutes.
• Senator: Do we get email updates about this?
• Katie: Yes I was going to announce this later, but if you are not on
the list serve let me know. Any questions about this process though
right now? Okay, great so we will vote on this selection process. So,
we will now move to a vote.
[passes by visual vote]
Okay, so now we are doing something a little new. We are swearing
in all new senators. This is new. We have a book but there are a lot
of you, so you can just stand up. I will now administer the oath.
[OATH]
• Katie: Julia should we do a picture?
• Julia: Sure!
• Katie: Now or later?
• Julia: Now is good.
Good of the Order & Announcements
• Katie: Okay now the last thing we do is Good of the Order. This is a
chance for anyone to say something about an event that may be
happening on campus or a comment that they would like to make
to Senate.

next week.

Kevin: Fall light walk last night. It was a great turnout from
Evanston and NU. We took a Northern route to Colfax. We were
pleasantly surprised, but we will be compiling a report. We are also
now doing PR for Cats Come to Dinner. Great way for NU students
to connect to Evanston residents. If you know any residents or
students interested, encourage them to sign up!
Noah: Happy start to midterms. Study abroad guide is sending out
surveys. We are trying to focus on 3 locations to launch, London is
ready to go. We also met with CR about making Wildcards useable
in Evanston.

week. In a couple of weeks, a few ASG people will be meeting with
higher up administration about NU’s technology, such as NUTV and
the possible replacements that hasn’t worked out yet. If you have
any ideas or constituent ideas, please let me know.
Julia: I put everything in exec board report. We are starting to work

[Presentation]
Alex: You may have heard we are looking for the AVP for D&I.
When we seek a candidate, how can they work with you?

member of our community. They do not have to be a certain gender
or ethnicity, but can connect with the 4 communities in MSA.
Adam: What events can we get involve in?
Cory: I have flyers. We have 4 groups, so we have a lot for people
to get involved in. I am personally hosting Serenity Nights for
students who want to talk about identity issues. We are also
partnering for CAPS. We also have a queer person of colors group
going on, and it’s about how people identify themselves. We are
open. WE also have Quench, which stands for Queers for lunch. We

are having a professor come in to give a lecture. We have another
event about the stigmas of mental health for the black community.
For Hispanic month, we are partnering with Latino studies. We are
definitely trying to get at the identity issues people are facing. We
are also having Festivale, which is a great way to get a taste of a
bunch of different cultures on campus together. We don’t have too
many Asian American events right now, but we will be having them
soon.
Order: SGC Confirmation
Ani: While we wait, the Happiness Club and I met with a group
called Give back?? Its raised over $16 million. We are having it as a

Chicago and help improve the lives on Northwestern students. It’s
not to time commitment or strenuous but and interesting
opportunity.
Katie: Neel will you introduce your nominee, then we will vote to
confirm.
Neel: We had SGC recruitment and we chose her from 6 applicants.

and code. And the clarity.
Adam: It is important to make sure that the legislation is clear
about what it wants to do.
Petros: You get a bill that is completely ambiguous and unclear in
its writing and purpose. What would you do and how would you talk
with the author?

Senator: What other commitments do you have?
Taylor; NBN, 4 classes, and I play tennis.
Dana: Exec of sorority, business fraternity
Adam: I will find the time for this.
Grace: AKPsi and DFA. But they are flexible and I am good at
planning my time.

o The newest Rules Committee members are Grace, Taylor, and
Dana.
Katie: We will now take nominations for the two-quarter position.
Alex: I nominate Katie and Adam
Katie: 2nd
Adam: 2nd
Isaac: I nominate myself
Senator: 2nd
Katie: Please come on up and arrange yourselves and introduce
yourselves.
Katie: I’m Katie.
Adam: I am Adam.
Isaac: I am Isaac R and I would really like to get more involved as
a freshman on senate. Obviously, how resolution and legislation is
written has a lot of impact.

Steven: What ASG committees are you involved in?
Adam: None
Isaac: CR
Katie: None
Senator: What is your experience with Robert’s Rules?
Isaac: Not great, read the Wikipedia page a couple of times. I know
it is to keep order, keep an open space to speak.
• Katie: I was student council president my senior year so I was good
with organization.
• Adam: Most of my experience is from ASG and my past year.
• Taylor: Do you have any other time conflicts?
• Katie: Church group
• Adam: I am on college dems and I very flexible.
• Isaac: I tutor once a week.
• Dana: Can you tell us about your commitment to ASG and being a
Senator?
• Adam: I am very dedicated. I represent in College Dems in ASG
and other student voices.
• Isaac: I am very committed, and I want to continue with Senate. I
held a fireside yesterday in my dorm about the tobacco-free
resolution and gauged their reaction to vote accordingly today.
• Katie: I am committed to staying with ASG.
• Dana: Jow do you work with groups if there is an issue of what we
should do about a piece of legislation?
• Isaac: I tend to look for common ground and come up with a
compromise. I think people tend to talk in circles when they are
trying to get their point across, and I don’t find that productive.
• Katie: I think I would look for our commonalities, and then bring
together the issues and try to find compromise
• Adam: I have worked with groups that have nothing in common.
Sometimes we don’t have the best agreements, but work with the
smart student groups to help get their purpose and point across.

Katie: Skipping second round if Rules elections temporarily to
consider this bill
Carolyn: only affect usage, not possession. No ability to search
students. In addition, tobacco policies have been changing all our
lives. Slippery slope, you can’t go back once you start. Initial
opposition, but it tapers off as time goes by and everyone gets used
to it. Tobacco free instead of smoke free, in order to include
potentially unsafe products and maintain uniformity in the
community. Also assures for promotion of overall health for the
students at large. Harder to pass tobacco free after smoking free
because of loss of momentum. Inclusion of COFHE schools in the
proposed amendments. Faculty Senate has already passed a similar
resolution.
Katie: 10 minutes for questions
Harrison: Isn’t tobacco free campus a misleading term?
Carolyn: Generally used terminology for these resolutions.
Jacob: Work with grad students?
Carolyn: Working with med school student.
Jacob: Enforcement on Chicago and Evanston campus?
Carolyn: Ideally yes.
Ronak: Talk to staff?
C: yeah
Adam: Have you talked to campus security?
C: Not yet, we wanted this support first.
Mark: People don’t abide by 25 feet rule, so how will this help?
C: Signage and also getting rid of ash trays.
Evan: What about staff and workers that smoke? Would they have
to go off campus?
C: Yes that it is what they would have to do. 69% of people do
want to quit smoking
Senator: Do you have any stats on here?
C: 3.4% and 12.9% from Searle
Taylor: Do you have any background information that this currently
is working?
Carolyn: The numbers have gone down since 2010.

Adam: Have you talked to any other groups or organizations that
have adopted polices such as this?
Carolyn: Yes….
Senator: How will this be enforced?
Carolyn: signage and will be introduced through spread of word.
Timo: What difficulties have people had with implementing this?
Carolyn: It just take times and changing the social norm.
Isaac: Don’t you think it is harsh to compare an outdoor smoke-free
policy to an indoor policy.
Carolyn: There is no safe space to second hand smoke and areas
are transitioning to these policies slowly.
Elena: Have you talked with administration and staff that will have
to enforce this?
Carolyn: Only some
Sean: Are there any specifics on implementation in the resolution?
Carolyn: No.
Mark: Why is this important to you?
Carolyn: My dad is in public health, and I have grown up wanting to
protect the public health of those around us.
Luke: Timeline?
Carolyn: It depends
Eliza: Are you willing to act as on an advisor for spreading polices
like this, if this were to pass?
Carolyn: Yes
Timo: What are some consequences of not following this?
Carolyn: We can give tickets, but mostly peer encouragement.
Dillon: If the 25 foot rule won’t work, why would this?
Carolyn: Its more about a social norm change, and its harder to
estimate 25 feet.
Senator: Do you have any stats on progress for schools that have
implanted this?
C: A lot are still in the implementation phase.
Taylor: Sheridan sidewalk belongs to Evanston, could students
smoke there?
Carolyn: We will work that out with Evanston health officials.
Katie: We are out of time. We now move into debate.

Dana: Motion to amend. Motion to put in all amendments in red.

Senator: 2nd
Katie: Okay we will now move to a vote.
[pass]
Katie: Great those pass. And now we will move into debate.
Petros: I don’t think that this is the solution to a current 25 foot
legislation law, and we shouldn’t put forth more legislation to pass
this. It is up to Evanston to demand for their policies to should
enforce there own issues.
Katie: Pro speech
Sean: I am not 100% sure about the this. I am more in offense of
what Petros said. This is a resolution, not a legislation mandating
action. This isn’t a band aid resolution, but it is for when they go
forth to those to who will find a solution to show that they have
ASG support.
Alex: Hi I’m Alex and I am here to speak against this legislation. As
students, we are adults and should have a right to smoke. And it
would be problematic to staff to go off campus. I think this
resolution breeds mistrust amongst students, and I think going up
to someone and a making a comment about someone else’s health
would breed more problems.
Carolyn: It is about protecting the right of non-smokers, not against
current smokers. We are choosing the right for a clean air and
healthy environment.
Mark: If that is the case, why are you supporting a full tobacco
ban?
Carolyn: It is move to support a healthier life overall, and we don’t
know yet the effects of e-cigarettes.
Isaac: I think that my issue with the resolution is that we are
inflating issues of smoking with all tobacco products. I like clean air,
but it is someone’s right to be able to chew or smoke e-cigarettes. I
think it’s an insane way to look at the world to ban things that are
bad for them. What’s next, cookies? I think that the school needs
less rules not more rules. The closest place on campus for kids to
smoke is Sheridan road. So, logistically everyone would go to

•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•

Sheridan road, the most populated area of campus. Is that where
we want all of the smokers of Northwestern to go? Think about it.
Alex: I can understand the issue with e-cigarettes. I do think that
we should keep chewing tobacco. People tend to turn to tobacco if
they can’t smoke to get nicotine. And chewing tobacco is gross if
you have ever seen it and you don’t want to do that either.
Sean: Would you be willing to amend this to be a smoke-free
campus?
Carolyn: I would like to keep e-cigarettes, but if it won’t pass than
this then yes.
David: Motion to amend to take out and e-cigarettes.
Carolyn: Evanston may pass legislation about e-cigarettes.
David: I don’t think that is relevant.
Kevin: It is still under consideration and it is still skeptical.
Katie: All in favor of David's amendments? Opposed? Abstain?
[Passes]
Katie: We are out of time for debate. So we will now move to a
vote.
Senator: Division
[10, 19, 8]
Katie: The resolution fails.
New Business: SL1314-01 The Never Ending Story of the 10K
Initiative
Author Speech/Alex: This is legislation that clarifies the initiative. In
the fall a survey gets released to the student body for ideas on how
to spend $10,000. We go through those ideas and then recommend
approximately 5. Senate then approves or denies those ideas and
they are sent out. Whichever wins the popular vote is then enacted.
A lot of things were passed, but never became part of the ASG
Code. Basically, what happened before was that there were no term
limits, which confused things. If that makes sense at all. You now
must be re-elected every year as an ASG rep. I also added 5-7
submission because that is more clear. And, yeah.
Mark: Why is reasonable similarity to other selection processes
relevant criteria?

Alex: We could combine ideas that are similar. Like benches and
tables.
Mark: Does that not read against ideas that are out of the box?
Alex: No, but if you think so we can amend.
Senator: We fund all of this now?
Alex: Yes
Senator: Can those on the committees submit an idea?
Alex: I don’t know, but it would have to work more as a trust
system
Mark: I don't think that is consequential. It is about finding the best
idea of all students.
Dana: My question is about change from approximately 5 to 5-7.
What if there is only 4? Do we just present a bad idea?
Alex: Ani can speak to this.
Ani: It’s more as a guideline to the committee to not cut so harshly.
Alex: Last year we got 300 submissions, I hope we can find 5.
Senator: How many people vote in the final selection?
Alex: I don't know. I don’t have those numbers first-hand.
Senator: We will put a threshold on how many students are voting
to see if it is worth putting forth $10K?
Alex: I think we do have a good enough turn out of voting to keep
this going. It is a yearly thing. Outreach is definitely critical though.
Dana: Point of Information: last year it was nearly 2000 votes.
Taylor: Last year, it said the money that wasn’t spent last year
would be rolled over. What oversight would we have for budgeting
and making sure we are spending the money smartly.
Alex: We have to give a presentation at the end to Senate about
where the money went, and Senate acts as oversight.
David: Motion to move this to old business.
Katie: Okay, that means we will not wait to next week to go to
debate about the legislation, but we will debate tonight and then
vote on it.
Dana: I object.
Alex: I would normally let this be old business next week, but we
are doing elections next week. And I want to advertise opening for

the committee. And right now there are no term limits. I want to
advertise 3 and 3, instead of I think 2.
Isaac: Why can’t we move elections back a week?
Alex: We want to get started with PR immediately. We did a hard
campaign last year, and I want things to go well again. And we are
already almost 4 weeks in the quarter.
Mark: We are not voting on new ideas, just to codify them right?
Dana: I rescind my objection.
Katie: We will not move to a vote.
David: I motion to PQ.
Mark: Can I amend?
David: I withdraw.
Mark: Can we amend or strike 3a?
Taylor: Motion to amend to say similarity of ideas…
Sean: Yes like similar ideas can be bunched together.
Katie: How would you want to say this?
Mark: Does this need to be in the code?
Abby: Common law
Alex: I just don’t know if we would be able to combine ideas.
Dana: Didn't senate do that last year?
Katie: Yes senate did that last year.
Mark: We all know what we are trying to say, but I don't think it
belongs in that section.
Sean: I think we can combine ideas to free up a slot, but I withdraw
for better wording.
Alex: I motion to amend, add “The committee reserves the right to
combine similar ideas.”
Sean: I like this. Yep. This is what I was wanting to do.

Good of the Order & Announcements
• Abby: Congrats to Isaac, the newest member of Senate.
• Anna: We got 22 new members, which is great and they will fit into
good roles. Jen met with Sodexo about to-go options. Please give
her some feedback
o Jen: So basically, Rachel is marketing head of Sodexo, and
we are looking to roll-out the wildcat to-go plan. We will test
a pilot program in the west side of foster-walker.
o Katie: Any feedback?
o Mark: What happened to great room?
o Anna: Closed.
o Mackenzie: Can we use regular meal swipes for it?
o Rachel: That was the original idea, but it doesn’t work for
unlimited meal plans.
o Katie: Questions?
• Abby: Okay Senate Reform update. I met with Burgie who
determined school wide coverage for the Weekly isn’t feasible. Now
I am working on reaching out to each school. Weinberg is tricky.
School-wide emails aren’t really sent out normally and we cannot
go by department because those who are still undeclared would
never hear from their Senator. I will give you an update when I
hear from the schools.
• Harrison: What did Burgie say?
• Abby: Logistically it wasn’t feasible to send out school wide updates
and announcements about ASG. It is too cumbersome.
• Mark: Tuesday, Seed is bring Adrian Green from Entourage to talk
about green issues.
• Jaime: Saturday morning, 8-10, breakfast on the block, some
sororities are coming to together, $3.
• David: This Sunday, dancer registration for DM starts. If you don’t
know what that is, well you’re not living. Also talk and spread
interest. Also, let me know if there is any interest in creating an
ASG team.
• Katie: My sorority is hosting a slumber-party registered party. We
are also holding a Ztate Fair.
Roll Call and Adjournment

Noah: This money is not sponsoring an event, but to feed students
chips. We should be helping new events happen, not funding
extras.
• Alex: Can you further elaborate on the advertising issue?
• Harrison: I’m sorry that was a miscommunication on our part with
NU World Cup on how project pool funding work.
• Evan: Maybe they meant that Harrison and I are working with them
on behalf of ASG.
• Katie: Pro speech.
• Harrison: I think Ani brought up a lot of issues that should be
addressed. As you can see, we are very surprised by the
advertising. Also, this is not haphazard. We have been planning this
out for a while, but there was no Senate last week to bring up.
• Katie: Con speech
• Sofia: I think in terms of fundraising the pool is an outlet and there
are funding outlets on campus that ISA has relations with for you to
go to. There are B-Status whose complete focus is food and that is
the purpose that put in a concerted effort to fundraise even though
their programming is centered around food. This event will happen
regardless and the event is not about food, it is about the World
Cup.
• Sarah: PQ
• Alex: 2nd
• Katie: Move to a vote

Special Order: Associate VP for Diversity and Inclusion Confirmation -Thaddeus Tukes

•

•

•
•

•
•

•

•

Ani: Just to give you guys a refresher on the committee itself, a few
of us came in and presented this revamped position. This position
was created last year and works under the Director of Student Life.
We updated the position description to include how Northwestern
approaches Diversity and Inclusion. The position is not the sole
person in ASG responsible to all things Diversity and Inclusion
related. They are the expert and the person of contact and help us
navigate issues related to Diversity and Inclusion. The position is
supposed to serve all students on campus, because at this
university we hold Diversity and Inclusion highly. Any questions?
Thaddeus really blew us away in the interview and touched on not
only the obvious issues, but also more subtle ideas.
Thaddeus: My name is Thaddeus Tukes, I’m a sophomore here,
doubling in Jazz Studies and Journalism. I applied for this position
because I have not only observed events last year and this year,
but also I’ve also spoken to many leaders and have noticed holes in
communication. I don’t see minority groups just as race, gender,
sexuality, etc. but any group that is underrepresented.
Taylor: One advantage members on exec have had is the time
they’ve had already. How will you start out?
Thaddeus: A lot of what I’ll be doing are things I’ve already started
doing on a micro-scale. Being in this position allows me to do it at a
larger scale. I don’t have the same experience they’ve had, but I do
have experience and knowledge that I can use and apply to that
larger scale.
Alex: What do you say is the most similar position to this one that
you’ve held in the past?
Thaddeus: I’m also the editor of Pulse Magazine and one of my
roles is expanding the magazine. How can we reach more
communities and expand what we’re doing. I’ve been in that
position for a year and it’s my most applicable official experience.
Mark: You are obviously very accomplished on campus and I
imagine you double majors are also time consuming. How will you
manage your time?
Thaddeus: It’s just a matter of changing spaces. A lot of what I’ll be
doing are things I already do every day. Now, instead of it being in

•
•

•
•

•
•

•
•
•
•

•
•

my own personal space, it’ll be in the public space. It will be an
additional time commitment, but definitely manageable.
Alex: When did you hear about this position and when did you
make your decision to run?
Thaddeus: I heard about it last year and didn’t realize that it was
open this year until a day before the deadline. Luckily there was an
extension.
Isaac: How are you at relating to people who are not a member of
your specific community?
Thaddeus: Even within my own community there are people that
are very different. The way I approach everything is very open. I
know I’m in a unique position. I’m the only jazz studies and
journalism on campus and I would like people to approach me as a
unique and open person, so I do that for them.
April: How do you plan to use ASG to bring together different
communities?
Thaddeus: The first step is to approach the student and faculty
leadership in various realms. If you get all of the leadership on
board and on the same page, it’ll be easier to connect the groups. I
will be going person to person and within groups of friends, but the
key thing is to get the leadership in on the same agenda. Then we
can expand and simultaneously become inclusive.
Mark: Have you had the opportunity to interact with the committee
as it exists now?
Thaddeus: No I haven’t. That’s probably because I’m not in the
position.
Mark: How do you plan to lead a committee?
Thaddeus: The best example I like to lead is being the leader of a
band. I know about egos and personalities and opinions. As a
leader, you have to listen to what everyone has to say and
understanding what we can do and what we can. Not everyone will
agree, but I’m going to try my absolute best to compromise.
April: How do you plan to get other students involved in ASG,
especially communities that are underrepresented.
Thaddeus: Leadership. I have to go to the people with sway and
have them explain how important it is. We need to impress on

•
•

•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

everyone how important it is to be a part of ASG and be able to
influence change. Leadership is the first priority, but after that I
want to work with that leadership to help communities understand
the importance.
Gio: Can you list off some of the relevant people?
Thaddeus: I can say I’ve spoken with – administration is a difficult
one. I have not yet been in a position to address them forthright.
I’ve spoken with the leaders of Alianza and FMO. That’s how I found
that there was a lack of communication between those two groups.
Obviously there are more groups than that. I do have to reach out
more to leaders, but that will definitely happen.
Katie: Okay that is the end of question period.
Mark: Motion to extend by three minutes.
Senator: Second.
Taylor: There are obviously some students who don’t think diversity
is important, what do you say to them?
Thaddeus: It really is hard to convince people who don’t see the
need. First, I would express to them the amount of resources they
would have access to in an inclusive environment. Friendships,
relationships, jobs, careers, everything. If you want to become the
best you, that requires putting yourself in positions that you might
not be comfortable with.
Alex: Who’s your favorite jazz musician?
Thaddeus: That’s a hard question, bro.
Angela: One of the issues in diversity debates has been the
emotionality that arises. How would you approach that obstacle?
Thaddeus: I would let them know that being emotional is okay.
Different experiences will cause emotional responses. What I will do
is create safe spaces. Yes this will be touchy, emotional, and you
might be offended, but we have to go there. I won’t say it’ll be
emotionless, but I want to help people work through that.
Katie: That’s the end of question period.
Mark: Motion to extend by 3 minutes.
Senator: Second.
Mark: The university is using the euphemism “uncomfortable
learning.” What do you think about it?

Thaddeus: I think the concept is good, but you’re predisposing
people to feel uncomfortable. I do like the idea of people being
uncomfortable, but it could be reworded.
Harrison: What do you see being your major accomplishments a
year from now?
Thaddeus: Communication, because once you establish that, that’s
how you get expansion and change. I’m also interested in mental
health and we’ve seen the consequences of ignoring our well being.
I want to work with Student Life and the rest of exec to help us feel
like we’re in a safer and more comfortable environment. We’re
young, we should not be this stressed. I don’t want to give a
general answer, but more inclusivity. It sounds ambiguous, but in
general we should have a safer and more comfortable environment
between communities.
Katie: That’s the end of question period.
[Confirmed unanimously.]
[OATH ADMINISTERED]
Order: 10K Committee Elections
Katie: We will now move to the non-Senator positions for the 10K
committee.
Alex: The 10K Committee is in charge of conducting the 10K
Initiative. Fall is a low commitment about getting the word out and
getting students to submit the ideas. Then in Winter we narrow
down the ideas that then get submitted to Senate. Then 4 weeks to
the end of Winter, the final ideas get sent out to students to vote
on. Then Spring is about getting it accomplished.
Katie: We have 3 non-ASG positions.
Senator: Frances
Alex: 2nd
Harrison: Dane Steer
Alex: 2nd
Dane: What is going on? No thanks.
Alex: if any positions, aren't filled, I can just fill them.
Isaac: How? Your friends?
Alex: It is up to my discretion, but it will be a legitimate process.

Frances: My name is Frances Woo and I am a junior. I want to be
on 10K because I am very involved on campus. I founded a group
on campus promoting public and mental health. I am involved in
SHAPE and my Greek community. These experiences have given
me the opportunities to work with ASG already, working on the
alcohol working group and others. I really want to help the
Northwestern student body. I have great time management skills,
but I have already made connections to many people on campus.
Alex: What was your favorite idea last year?
Frances: The mental health one.
[Confirmed unanimously]
Katie: We will now move to fill 3 ASG spots. Nominations?
Harrison: Korri and Evan
Korri: I accept
Evan: I accept
Angela: Danielle Lay
Danielle: I accept
Isaac: Mark Silberg
Mark: Kind, but no.
Nevil: I nominate myself.
Korri: I am the Elder Senator and I am interested in being on the
10K committee because this year as a freshman I have been blown
away by how passionate the student body is. And I want to be an
active part to help facilitate having student ideas come alive.
Evan: I am the Allison Senator. I was on the 10K committee last
year, and I love working to make student ideas real. It is like a live
Campus Voice.
Angela: I am on SGC. I want to be on 10K because I think ASG is
an invaluable resource to Northwestern and people underestimate
the power of student voice with ASG. I think that is really
important. On campus, I have been involved in SGC since
Freshman year, I am VP of Finance for one of the newest groups for
NSH, and I am in an a cappella group.
Nevil: I am on Services. I was on D&I and PLI and that allowed me
to get exposed to many aspects of Northwestern. I am a CA. The

10K really fascinates me, and the idea of getting ideas and seeing it
through to completion I would really like to do.
Petros: What would be your winning 10K idea?
Evan: I am going to go with one that I saw last year. Sorry to be
cheating. I would go with an outdoor movie theater. I think it would
be a great way to bond the Northwestern community.
Danielle: More Saferides. More cars and resources.
Nevil: I would suggest updating the bus signs to track shuttles and
buses.
Korri: I would want to update Patten gym. I would want it to be a
more full-scale gym. I think it would help with late night workouts
and on cold days when walking isn’t very good.
Isaac: I move to end question period.
Senator: 2nd
Alex: Oh and Maddy Low wanted to run. Here are some notes she
sent me to read:
o 1. I'm Maddy Low, senior theatre major, environmental policy
minor, Chinese minor. I'm the senator for StuCo.
o 2. I'm interested in the committee because I think a lot of NU
students feel like there's a lot of bureaucracy in the way of
their voices being heard about suggestions they have to make
NU a better place, things that don't fit into the established
channels, and the 10K is a great avenue for them.
o 3. I'm currently in a show that rehearses 4-5 nights a week
(hence why I'm not at senate this week) but weekends are
free and the show ends mid-November.
o 4. I've produced student theatre before so I have first-hand
experience with how far an amount like $10,000 can go on
campus, and the proudest I've felt as a producer was when I
was able to not only say "yes" to a team member's idea, but
be able to support it with money we raised. I've been
involved with all kinds of activities in my four years from
Jones Res College exec to marching band to theatre to
Engineers for a Sustainable World so I've got my feet in lots
of areas on campus and think I would be a good candidate to

raise awareness and have conversations about the 10K
initiative across the spectrum.

• David: Motion to move SL1314 up.

• Senator: Objection
• Katie: We are going to go to a vote.

agenda item up. That’s two thirds, so we are going to see the new
business SL1314 now. We are in line for an authorship speech.
New Business: SL1314-02: Increasing Dance Marathon Accessibility
• DM Exec: First off thanks for changing the agenda. As a bit of
background information, we strongly feel that DM is one of NU’s
strongest organizations. No matter who you are you can participate,
but the $50 registration fee does stop people. We are asking for
some money from the Senate Pool. The students would have to
apply for a scholarship through CSI to help them register to dance.
This is a registration fee and should not be confused with the
money raised for DM. Students who get external scholarship will be
considered in the same way as people with Northwestern Financial
Aid. One of our goals is to help people sign up who aren’t able to
financially. Any of the $4000 that isn’t used will be given back to
the pool. And if it is used, that shows we do have need. And
according to ISBE the reason most students are not able to
participate financially is due to the registration fee.
• Senator: What if they can’t raise the $400?
• Janet: That is a difficult question, but we would refund the $50.
• Josh: We wouldn’t give back donations, but we would refund the
$50.
• Sean: How much do we have in the Project Pool?
• Katie: $15,000
• Taylor: Why don’t you just waive the fees?
• Josh: We need that money for the actually production of DM.

Anna: And any money that is raised goes straight to the
beneficiary.
Taylor: Why don’t you get the productions money donated?
Janet: The money from registration fees does not cover all of the
production costs and we do raise money for it as well.
Nikki: Would this go to towards this year?
Anna: Yes, on the registration right now there is a box you can
check to talk to a CSI member.
Isaac: Is this something you are going to ask for every year.
Janet: We are looking for more sustainable resources.
David: We have talking to PTI right now. We are a sustainable
group, but we are in the position that we need those fees to make
DM possible.
Sean: Can you talk about your decision to be B-Status?
David: This is due to revenue fees. If we received a large amount of
money, it would be worth it. But since we would have to give back
80% of ticket sales (registration fees) to the fund, it does not make
sense for us right now to become and A-Status group.
Isaac: So you will never become A-Status?
David: That is not necessarily true. We are looking at adjusting the
rules to make it make sense for us.
Isaac: You guys get a lot of corportate sponsors. You would just
raise $1M instead of $1.4. So is that what you are asking from
Senate?
Janet: No that is not how our corporate sponsorships work.
Anna: It would be considered embezzlement if we didn’t have what
they donate for exactly go towards exactly towards that.
Sophia: Would you look at Student Affairs to get money, if it wasn’t
awarded tonight? Or would your return the money not used to the
Pool? So, if only 1K is given or even used?
Josh: Yes. We are making a conservative estimate.
David: The money could go back this quarter.
Natalie: Would it be helpful if I explained the SASF? This is a fund
for $5000 per quarter, and it is a fund that is used for any student
for any student group that demonstrates for need for financial aid.
The way that is vetted is that they fill out an application and sign

something that lets me go to Financial Aid to get a ranking. It is not
a perfect system, such as if you receive money from another source
for school. We are encouraging students to apply for this first, and
then this money that you are giving would help supplement that.
Katie: We are out of time.
David: I motion to move this to old business due to time
sensitivity?
Senator: Objection
David: We need the money this year and it would be negligible for
next year. Registration ends Friday.
Josh: Not totally negligible. But if the idea is about inclusion, we
need to make sure we have the money this week.
Senator: Would this make it old business and move to the end of
agenda?
Katie: Yes
Petros: You all probably set this time for registration a long time
ago, and you should have come last week.
Ani: As an old Speaker, I understand the importance of
parliamentary procedure. But, this idea has developed over the past
couple of days, and we have been trying to connect the dots. But
we are talking about inclusion here. We want to make sure DM is
representative of the whole student body.
Isaac: I don’t understand why you can’t move your deadline one
week to accommodate the procedure of Senate, because you are
asking for 1/3 of our money for the year.
Evan: I do understand what you are saying, but not making this old
business that makes this money useless.
Alex: I absolutely understand the objections, I normally would
agree, but this money will not be gone immediately. The money will
only be gone if students really need it. And isn’t that what the pool
is for?
Taylor: I think that one thing is being said is that this would be
good for our constituents. But, if I don’t talk to my constituents,
then I don’t know. Also, if registration for DM has increased each
year, then I am not sure why this would be necessary. And I think

extending registration due to finance concerns, that would be
creating more inclusivity.
• Sean: They came in here with a lot of background information and
data.
• David: If you were to talk to your constituents, they would say 2
things, “yes I do this money, or not I don’t.” So the money will be
spent or it won’t. And the bill is built for just that. As a long-time
member of ASG, I understand, but I don’t want this to affect
someone’s ability to participate in DM.
• Will: I think we need to be able to go back to our constituents.
• Mark: Authors, can you explain the claim that students don’t
participate because of the registration fee?
• David: ISBE analytics conducted it because they are much better at
it. I am not sure how they question is worded, and but I know that
need for a fund like this is needed. This would pay for 80 students,
and if 300 apply then we will take a look at they applications.

Working on the SAFC, I have noticed continuity working with the
student group is extremely important. Also, there is a huge learning
curve, and I think I am in a great position to help my groups
continue to be doing well.
Jason: I am a five quarter member of SAFC. I agree experience is
really great. I have help coordinate inter-group programming. And I
think that the relationships I have are strong and should continue.
Amrit: I am a senior and not to beat a dead horse but I have been
on the SAFC since my sophomore and have really enjoyed my time.

my student groups and I want to apply that to other student
groups.
Sean: I’m Sean, junior, IFC Senator. I have been an AE for a year
now, so I do know the time commitment. I have worked with 3 very
unique groups, smaller and larger. I have helped the smaller groups
rise up to success, and the larger groups continue to succeed. As an
AE, I have learned a lot and gained a lot of experience that I think
is very necessary for this position.
Tori: I was a senator until the end of last year. I am the longest
standing member of the SAFC and have worked with all sorts of
student groups. And it has been the most rewarding experience. We
currently have a young board, and I would love to see it continue to
grow.
Adam: This is my second time to run for SAFC, and I am very
passionate about student groups. This year, I asked Siddiq how I
can pitch in. I have now talked to 15 student groups, asking how
can we help them as ASG. Because what is obvious to an AE, may
not be apparent to student group leaders. I have been a leader of
student group, and I think that experience would really aid me even
though I haven’t served on SAFC yet. I think I would be an
innovative and helpful AE.
Will: I am a junior and a College Republicans Senator. I have
worked at 2 banks, so I think I can combine my experience there
and with student groups and ASG.
Ronak: I am an off-campus senator. I want to give Northwestern a
bigger focus of the whole school. I am apart of model UN, and we
raise our $50,000 budget internally, as well as working on our
current deficit. I have lot of experience with student group
budgeting, and I want to help work with groups to get recognized,
because we have a lot of student groups that should be heard, and

Siddiq: We do work a lot of hours but it is a selfless job. You have 2
midterms on Wednesday and it is Tuesday, and you have to attend
an SAFC meeting or else Blowout wont’ happen. When have you
Tori: I have a job offer, so school doesn’t matter anymore. I would
definitely prioritize the group over the school work and I have done
it before and I will do it again. It’s about programming using a lot of
money compared to one grade.
Adam: I interviewed this week with a student group leader when I
had to study for a midterm. I would make sure to make us. Also,
we could create an anonymous facebook persona, so all can take
advantage of asking questions.
Will: It is all about prior planning, so hopefully it won’t happen. But
if that were to happen, you need to make this commitment a
priority. I am apart of ISBE, and working with micro financing I had
a lot of reports to get in and prioritized ISBE.
Ronak: I would make sure I didn’t get into that issue. And my
grades only affect me, so I would have. I have 2 midterms
tomorrow, so I am experiencing that tonight.
Eliza: A&O Blowout, I had a lot of work, so did I have to pull a lot of
late nights. Yes, but it was worth it.
Sean: I think knowing what you are getting into before you do it
really is important. Being flexible with your schedule means good
communication. So working with. Also, I am a film major, so that is
not that burdening…were going to cut it off there.
Isaac: I motion to close question period
Alex: I object.
Isaac: I rescind
Amrit: Time commitments?
Adam: I am apart of the c. I will make sure that the student groups
that I work with will always be able to reach me. I have worked
with an AE and know the importance
NARS, NUCR, and Senator
AKPsi, and Model UN, but those aren’t too time consuming until
Spring for Model UN.

Eliza: Senator, DM and A&O committee members. I am good at
time management though, so I don’t see that as an issue.
• Sean: A&O and DM Committees, Deans Advisory Council, WW,
treasurer of fraternity. It sounds like lot, but I have been juggling
that for a while.

series, I graduate in winter too so I have

and I couldn’t imagine not being on the SAFC.
• Adam: I think experience is essentially and I have that to be a
great AE.
[Winners- Eliza, Tori, Sean]
Old Business: SL1314-02: Increasing Dance Marathon Accessibility
• DM Exec: I think at this point everyone understands the logistics.
From our understanding inclusion is the end goal for everyone and I
know that’s a priority for ASG. The project pool is really cool and
using all the money is ideal, because it shows that there is a need.
The competency about us does not have to be worried about,
because we are going through the Northwestern department that
always does this. We’ve been asked why we aren’t trying to get this
money from other places and it is because we know that ASG’s
mission matches this initiative. This is a great way not to ask
students to single themselves out, but to give them an opportunity
to ask anonymously. If we get this from ASG then we can use it to
show the administration later on.
• Isaac: Are you putting any of your own money to this? For instance,
you could have some kind of fundraiser for production expenses?
• Josh: For us it is really difficult to distinguish the fundraising for the
organization and the beneficiary. For legal purposes, we want to
keep fundraising for the beneficiary. We are not giving Senate Pool
money to Team Joseph and we are not going to ask people to
•

fundraise for a tent and not for the beneficiary. Our costs go mostly
to put on DM as a production. We haven’t put forth money to do
this, because we don’t have the capacity to do so.
David: We were cornered to raised our registration fees. We are
have a lot of expenses and pressures that made us raise our
registration fees 11%.
Taylor: You said this was a short-term solution but you are looking
towards longs term. What are some of those?
Janet: We are hoping that this will be a catalyst for other
Northwestern bodies to help out in the future.
Josh: This is a conversation that would need to happen in the
spring.
David: We have already talked to PTI. If you think that we think
this is our fund, then next year you can turn it down. This pool is
for causes just like this.
Isaac: Do you see these extenuating circumstances being an issue
in the future.
Janet: NAA will be helping a lot more in the future.
Arian: You said that you may go around the conventional revenue
sharing. Are those conversations already going on?
David: That is something we are looking to explore in the future.
But I may have misspoke, but we are looking at our options for
more sustainable sources of funding for issues like this in the
future.
Ronak: Was the 11% inflationary, or reasons why you aren’t getting
as much sponsorships?
Janet: It is mostly due to relationships over the years with sponsors
and donors.
Josh: Each year we work to make the event safer and that is costly.
David: the extra costs are mostly due to a new financial system
that we had to use that was unexpected. But Northwestern is
working to help create a better financial system.
Taylor: Why wouldn’t you just lower the cost for student for those
who can’t pay?
Janet: We need a registration at X level because the revenue from
registration helps cover a portion of our production costs.

Taylor: Did you have an increase in dancers from last year?
Anna: Yes, but that doesn’t necessary mean it was from low income
students.
Isaac: I have an amendment. Be it enacted here assembled
“$2,000 be allocated from the ASG Senate Project Pool to provide
up to $2,000 of matching funds”. I think it is too early in the game
to allocate almost 1/3 of the Pool. I don’t remember even when we
took this money out of the budget, other than the fireworks at Dillo
Day. They said that they couldn’t raise funds that wouldn’t go to the
beneficiary. And I don’t think that is the case.
Senator: Did we spend the entire pool last year?
Katie: Not sure…
Alex: At the beginning of Spring, I think only $1000 was spent and
$5000 after that went to the project pool.
Isaac: I rescind.
Senator: Where did the fireworks money come from?
Sean: The fireworks are now sustainable.
Sarah: This is money goes towards production costs. This money
just offsets that for students.
Sean: They are B-status for a reason. On SAFC, we allocate $1.4M
pretty quickly. $20 for a B-status is a lot, and this would not be
much for a production like DM.
Siddiq: Did you work in a deficit last year since you didn’t get any
money last year from funding?

from our beneficiary.

• David: Hey! So I have kind of a significant topic to preview you all
about. I have been thinking about Senate reform again. Thank you
for the input I have received so far. So for a bit of context, every
year I have been here, I am now a senior, that every year a Senate
Reform has come up. And while some legislation of some sort have
been passed to increase accountability for senators, but a greater
change has not been enacted. Currently, I see two problems
regarding Senate Reform. 1. Senators feel that it is just one
singular group coming up with the plan. 2. They present one solid
plan that you have no input. So, next week we are having an open
focus group forum during Senate next week. Also, a week from
Monday we will have a larger meeting for all students. We will also
solicit various members of campus to get their input. Then we will
devise 3-5 plans to then present in Senate to vet and then we will
present one final plan. Any questions?

apart of the PLI curriculum as well.
• Sophia: It is Week 7 for you all don’t know, so I have been doing a
lot of considerable outreach this week. I have reach out to graduate
students, advisory boards. So if you have any personal contacts,
that would be really helpful for me to pass along. We are following
up on library chargers. Looking at practicum’s and JR’s. Please also
look at the Student Faculty Interaction Grant. It is a really neat
opportunity and you really should consider applying.
• Kevin: I will keep it brief. We just finished brainstorming and we
are in the beginning works of starting projects. We will be helping
out with the Evanston downtown bash. We are getting various
student groups to perform. Also, look out for the housing fair on
December 4th, and we will have another in the Winter. If you are
involved in a student group that wants to get further involved in the
community, please let me know. We are looking to be a resource
for students this week.
• Siddiq: We are working on supplementary funding. If you or your
student group has any funding questions, please contact me.
• Neel: We just finished funding. And we have a vacancy on the
committee, so we will being so a small recruitment. It is one of the
best committees. We put on the fall activities fair and work with b
and t status groups.
• Noah: We started coding for the unofficial student guide and it is
going well. Course seek got access to Caesar, minus CTECs. For the
study abroad guide, we decided to do London, Paris, and Buenos

would be great. Contact me.

on the mental health initiative. We are working on a lot of internal
and external outreach. We are also working on a history of ASG. Let

Harrison: hey guys, so same thing as last year. No changes. This is
an event for NUSPAN, a graduate student group that got spread t
Chris: Have you thought about partnering with other student
groups on campus? I think this could be a great opportunity.
Harrison: That’s a great question. You can pool resources that way.
NUSPAN as it launches into the undergraduate student body, we
want to hold a lot of programming with many student groups. This
event specifically, we want this to be a repeat even for NUSPAN and
working with another group would hurt us next year with securing
funds.
Chris: So as a follow up, I think there are other groups on campus
that could help out.
Harrison: of course I understand that the Pool should be a last
resort, but we have gone to all of the resources we have explored.
Siddiq: Can you talk about other events that NUSPAN has put on
and the results?
Harrison: NUSPAN was a graduate student group. They had a
speaker last week. We had a small fall event, and for a new group
and a fairly last minute event, I was happy with the 20-25 people
that came. We want to add something to the environmental event.
Siddiq: How many undergraduate students came to the event, and
how many are on your exec board?
Harrison: 2 on the exec board and I am not sure how many came
to the spring event?
Siddiq: Do you think that this $50 is essential for the program to be
put on?
Harrison: for the best and full experience event, yes I do. I think
that the speaker is essential and then that food afterward would be
it essential.
Chris: At first I felt like $50 was not so much, but now I feel that
we as ASG should be encouraging now
Mark: Just so you know NUSPAN has a student that sits on the
sustainability committee, and it has been a group that has a PHD.
There is collaboration, but not financial.
Alex: Are there any funds that are going towards the speaker?

Harrison: The speaker has been secured, so this is only for food
afterwards.
Alex: Is it okay for the funds to be allocated towards the speaker,
and not food?
Harrison: yes I guess that could happen. It is only an accounting
change.
Parag: Can you describe what you see as the future of NUSPAN.
Harrison: We want to discuss environmental events in the political
arena. We want this to be a policy discussing group, and I feel that
this event is the start of that.
Neel: The reason we don’t want normally give student groups food
is because we don’t find it sustainable. So have you looked into
venues that provide food?
Harrison: we did go to multiple different sources for food, well
groceries stores because we want cupcakes. I think that cupcakes
set a certain mood. We have looked at other sources, like the
sustainability fund. As far as the project pool goes, the pool should
be a last resort. We have tried to be organized, and we understand
that ASG should be our last line of defense and we are there. This is
a first time event. We want it to be sustainable, so we will not be
asking for further funds next year.
Katie: Question period is over.
Ani: Motion to amend to change the line item to cover the cost of
the speaker for the event.
Senator: 2nd
Katie: [Reads amendment] Any objections?
Sean: I object. Just seeing as what we have been discussing, we do
not fund retroactively. This event will occur no matter what, they
have the speaker. So, we should just fund the food, not what has
already been funded.
Mark: Just remember the pool is open for however Senators see fit.
Katie: We will now have a con for the amendment.
Adam: This is a more professional change. Food is not necessary,
and a speaker is more professional as well.
Alex: I don’t want a precedence that student groups can come to
Senate for food money, and a speaker is a much better choice.

Ani: To echo Mark’s comment, you can spend the pool money
however you see fit. I am just asking you all not to set a
precedence for food. I want to help student groups with this money,
but I want it to go to the speaker.
• Isaac: I have an issue with just misplacing funds so it looks like we
allocated money for a speaker. That is just disingenuous.
• Sean: We can just willy-nilly just spend the money on a case-bycase basis. Funding an event retroactively does not show
sustainability.
• Harrison: I just think retroactive is misleading.
• Sean: What I mean is that you already locked down the speaker.
• Senator: PQ
• Katie: We will not move to a vote.
• [Amendment fails]
• The original language stands.
• Katie: We are in line for con speech.
• Senator: PQ
• Senator: 2nd
• Katie: We will move to a vote.
• [Legislation passes]
New Business: B and T-Status Funding
• Neel: So we kind of change of the way we allocated our funding this
year. We used to give money for things like storage, but this year
we started with programming funding, and then leftover funds went
to public storage, etc. That is why the amount of public storage
went down form $350 to $100. We had a lot of limitations and had
to be a little bit stingy. We get about $11,000 for 80 groups. Next
week is when stuff happens.
• Katie: Please look over the packets we will be voting next week.
Again you can’t vote for your own funding and if you have any
Good of the Order & Announcements

and support.

	•	John: seven person committee that involves UBPC and ASG president.  We have an open poll in the fall quarter to brainstorm ideas from undergrads to figure out what they want.  At the end of winter quarter, we send another poll.  Then we submit a report to administrators.  We want to be an avenue for you and your constituents to the University administration. 
	•	Anil: We’re all here for the same reason: To make northwestern a better place.  If you guys come up with ideas, please reach out to us—you have your chance to voice your opinion.

	•	Questions?

You can petition to extend the debate if you want to hear more/have more debate.  Then will move to a vote.

Claire:
 NSC initiative.  First dorm storm tomorrow night.  IF you have an hour to spare, please come out!  
Also, US Empowered!  Please sign up!  It’s awesome and we want everyone to come.
Next, we are recognizing outstanding ASG members.  The first is Jared Cogan—he went to the off-campus meeting and took notes.  Also, shout out to Elana Westbrooke, Lydia Gao, and David Harris
Matt: Just to go off of a couple things that Claire said—we have about 5,000 business cards.  Just a clarification about the senator checklist and the In The Know.  The ITK is for external purposes, but the memo is for you.  Some of it might be a little repetitive.  The first set of checked off items is stuff you’re required to do.  Everything else is suggested.
Tyris: The center part of it is the required portion, like sending out the ITK or holding office hours.
Katie: Ask constituents about where students feel safe when they walk in the dark on campus.  We want to tell the administration where 
Ethan: ER is having a joint ward meeting, tomorrow 7pm in Tech LR2.  This is a great opportunity to interact with Evanston residents.  While it’s not mandatory, it’s expected all of ASG to attend.  This affects student groups, the greek system.
Isaac: point of information: Is there any way we can recycle these memos?
Tyris: speaking of being green!  Everyone, feel free to put up the agenda on your computer.  Also—to spice things up, if anyone has a funny youtube video, please feel free to share!
Special Order: ASGBuddy
Nancy: We’re starting ASG Buddy to help new senators get better acquainted with ASG.
Barry: This should be a great and very helpful program.  Please sign up!
General Order: SGVP Confirmation
Claire: Our recommendation is Liz Broder.  Speaking on behalf ot the selection committee, we chose Liz Broder because of her experience, passion, and initiative.
Liz Broder: Is a senior, 2nd year in ASG.  Background was based on student groups.  Was on the exec board of A&O, worked with DM, in Delta Gamma.  Biggest priority is to return stability to the SGVP position.  The disorganization led to confusion with funding, lots of backlog—and hopes to fix this.  Also wants to amend the guidelines, to award groups for merit, to make them clearer.  Wants to make sure that all resources are online.  Making sure that people know the difference between A and B status groups.
Questions?
Q: As a student groups senator, how do you plan on effectively communicating with all student groups senator?
A: Each student groups senator will have a GE, which is a member of the SGC that acts as a liaison between the SGC and the students groups.
Q: So the biggest problem in the past was communication with student groups and GE.  How do you propose the relationship between GEs and student groups?
A: Really wants to establish the relationship right away.  And will make sure that if a group is unresponsive, they are made know that that miscommunication will hurt them
Q: What will you do to make the transition more smooth then it has been in the past?
A: Really good record keeping that is organized and structured.
Q: Experienced problems—was thrown into a lot of groups who had a lot of needs, but without any training.  How can you make sure that a new committee member is not overwhelmed?
A: We really need to make sure that groups are aware of their deadlines.  Making sure that a standard is set, and that there is an expectation.  Will also make sure that every committee member is properly trained or informed.
Point of order: Liz works for Playboy.
Vote
Liz Broder is confirmed to the position of SGVP
Liz Broder is sworn into the position of SGVP by Claire Lew
New Business: Supplemental Funding
Emma: Difference between supplemental funding and spring funding.  Supplemental funding is comprised of revenue from the previous year, and 5% of the spring funding pool.  The groups on the front are the groups that applied for funding.  [Explanation of the funding packet].  Encouraged to contact Emma with questions, also, bring this back to your constituents and see what they think of this.  If there’s a dash that means that we didn’t recommend any money for  student groups.
Q: When honorariums are listed, is the name of the person listed the actual person who is coming?
A: No.  The person who they quote as coming is just an example of the level/caliber of the person/group who is coming.
Emma: Will send out an email.
New Business: SL 1011-01 Developing our Deliberate Assembly Pt. 1
Wilson: there are a few things that senate does that it’s the best thing to do but it’s not in the code.  So we will be conducting code review to codify some of these issues.  Come to us if you have any suggestions.
Tyris: This will be voted on next week.  To just elaborate—as practices, there are some things that we do.  There are some things that we traditionally do that conflict with Roberts Rules.
Old Business: SR 1011-01: ASG Stands with Pakistan
Over that past few weeks we had a campaign called NU Stands with Pakistan, and we raised about $18,500 dollars.

! Michael: I am president of ISA. ISA applied for funding
for $450 for the annual winter formal. I was surprised
when we received no funding for this. Last year we
were funded. The event attracts 200 students and two
security guards are needed $300 is needed for space
and safety, and $150 for lights and sounds
! GE: We didn’t give funding due to lack of funding. We
didn’t see this as a priority due to lowered attendance.
! Neel: Also, we are only
! Michael: We moved an event from fall to winter, and
that’s why we had 2 events in the same quarter.
! Alex: What do you mean by lack of attendance?
! GE: I didn’t feel like there was a large attendance last
year at the formal. It felt very empty. That is why we
are pushing for funding for the festival instead of
formal.
! Dana: How much is being asked for?
! Michael: For $450
! Isaac: How much were tickets last year, and how much
will they be this year if we do not fund this?
! Michael: Last year $19 and that covered venue costs
mostly. So it is hard to say. Probably about $20.
! Evan: Are formals normally funded?
! GE: It depends on what other programming the group
is doing. And if the formal is open to the entire campus.
The ISA formal is open and publicized to all, but it is

mostly international students that turn out. Which is
why the food and film festival was funded.
! Michael: We sold last year around 200 tickets.
! Siddiq: Where is the venue?
! Michael: The Hilton garden Inn or the Orrington?
! Petros: Have you looked for a cheaper venue?
! Michael: The Hilton was cutting costs.
! Ronak: why don’t you just raise tickets prices?
! Michael: We want to keep it as cheap as possible.
! Harrison: What happens if you don’t get this funding?
! Michael: We will raise ticket prices
! Parag: Do you think there will be decrease in
attendance if the ticket prices are raised?
! Michael: Yes
! Katie: We will now move to a con speech.
! Harrison: I motion to amend the funding request to
$300 for security guards.
! Senator: 2nd
! Katie: We will move to a vote.
[Passes]
! Harrison: I think this is in line with what SGC does. And
I would like to see this event go on.
! Katie: Con speech?
! GE: We normally don’t fund events off campus
! Isaac: Didn’t you fund it last year?
! Neel: We had a surplus, so it was lowest priority but we
did.
! Katie: We are in line for a con speech.
! Alex: I don’t think it is fair to fund only a couple groups
for 2 events. We need to do it for all groups, not just a
couple.
! Katie: We will move to a vote.

! David: Motion to add $200 to the line item tents.
! Katie: Okay come up and explain what the line item is.
! David: Two years ago we received $2000 and last year
we did not apply. To be honest, we were kind of
confused. We understand that ASG can’t fund DM. We
are kind of the status of an A-Status group but we can’t
forgo the money from revenue back to the SAF.
! GE: Why didn’t you apply for funding last year.
! David: It was a miscommunication on our part.
! GE: How did you manage if you didn’t have that
money?
! David: we kind of just made do. ASG gives very little to
DM so we have to find other ways. I am being very
transparent here. DM will go on if we don’t get this
money. We requested much more money than we were
allocated.
! Neel: So the $14,000 surplus. We had an $8000 deficit,
so we really only have a $6000 surplus. We want to try
to save as much for spring funding. Also DM is a highly
functioning group. We try to only fund groups that will
not be able to do funding for groups whose
programming would not otherwise go on.
! Isaac: This is going to seem irrelevant, but I will make
it seem relevant. When you asked for the $4000, you

said you couldn’t extend the deadline for registration
and then you did.
David: I pushed it to extend the deadline because I
thought we really should
Isaac: did that have any repercussions?
David: not any major ones?
Sarah: where is the money going to and why is it
important?
David: the tent is kind of arbitrary, but it is our biggest
costs. The tent is a fixed cost, and gets higher each
year as we get more participants. DM will go on no
matter what, but DM has to be more financially tight
than I had ever really expected.
Sarah: Sorry I think you misinterpreted the question. I
just want you to clarify for freshman.
David: Oh, sorry. The tent is put on the east lawn of
Norris and where hold the entire event each year.
GE: Why $200?
David: Because that’s how much we have left. I thought
we would have a bigger amendment pool. So, I am
asking for what is there.
GE: So where would the money go?
David: if it is allocated to the tent, it will go to the tent.
Harrison: why did you not ask for this in the first add
round.
David: It should go to a group first if a programming
event for them would not go on.
Katie: we are in line for a pro speech.
David: If you had an unlimited budget, think about
what sort of programming would you spend money on.
Students put more hours in to DM than any other event
on campus. We receive money 10 fold, 100 fold times
smaller than any other group on campus. Therefore, I
think

Alex: I love DM as much as anyone else. But this is
pretty blatant that this we would like how much money
you all have left. There are a lot of events that aren’t
going on because of lack of funding, and DM must do
that too.
Petros: I agree with everything Alex said. In addition,
we should follow the recommendations of
Katie: Pro speech?
Parag: DM is one of the most uniting events on campus.
Eliza: as David said, DM brings in a huge amount of
people. And as a Winter event, we should fund this
now.
Katie: Con speech?
Isaac: Last time you came in, we had to move
something immediately to old business, even though
you ended up moving the date. So, I am very unwilling
to fund this amount.
Ronak: As David said, DM will go on. Have the money
go to an event that will not go on if we do not give
them this money.
Katie: pro?
Harrison: If the money is there for us to use and they
could use it, we should grant DM the money.
Dillon: We should not hold grudges against DM due to
what has happened in the past.
David: We did not extend, we pushed back. If we
misled you, I am so sorry but that is not relevant to this
conversation.
GE: I want you to know that by granting this money,
you are taking it away from another group. DM will still
go on with this funding, but other programming will not.
GE: I understand DM is a special case, but we have
standards that we must follow. Precedent is very
important for us and must be followed.
Katie: We are in line with a pro.

David: I don’t disagree with anything that has been said
in the con speeches. I appreciate the standards that
SGC follows, but I also appreciate that Senate does not
have to follow the standards. Just because some
groups, this money will impact them more greatly, but
DM needs money as well. As Petros mentioned, DM
does not really fit into the status roles. This is a special
case that does not really set a precedence. Like with
NCDC and funding candy, it’s breaking the rules, but we
do it anyway.

• Katie: Next week will be doing the same thing only with A-Status
groups. Thanks to SGC.
• Siddiq: Stay tuned. If you want more information on student
groups, please contact me.
• Petros: Are you going to send it out?
• Siddiq: Yes we will.
New Business: SL1314-04: Northwestern Crew New Boat
• Katie: Anyone here for the SL1314-04?

• Katie: okay we will move to a vote.
[Passes]
New Business: SL1314-05: $hining a Light on $tudent Activities: An
Assessment of Support for Student Groups
• Sophia: We are asking to create a working group. I thought a lot
about the framework. Student groups are a huge apart of
Northwestern. This working group is to examine that culture. NU is
being looked at to be increased. We want this working group to
examine how the money is being spent and the transparency of it.
We are spelling out a really loose structure, but that is on purpose
so that no one is hypothesizing anything up front. The reason I am,
as AVP am speaking on this, is because there are programming and
academic spaces on campus. And a lot of groups choose to practice
in academic spaces, which I am more proficient on the workings of.
The working group will be overseen by me, Siddiq, and Neel. We
are not there to run the group, but to guide the group. The group
will be made up of SGC, SAFC, Academic and greater NU students.
• Ronak: have you thought about adding a space for a student group
senator?
• Sophia: The NU students can be SG Senators
• Sarah: Will the group be confirmed by Senate?
• Sophia: Yes
New Business: SL1314-06: Dog Therapy Benefitting Northwestern Relay
for Life

Alex: We confirmed the contract with the therapy dogs today, but
we need $50 for Northwestern to be named on Rainbow Therapy
Dog’s insurance. The $100 is a suggested donation fee. Relay For
Life wanted to pair with us as a fundraiser. So if we get the money
for the suggested donation, all other donations will go to Relay For
Life.
• Evan: Since we don’t normally fund donations, can we say that if
we raise $100, that we can get it back?
• Alex: We could not have given them any money last year, but they
probably wouldn’t have come back.
• Dana: Just to clarify, the $150 covers all costs for the event?
• Alex: yes
• Chris: How many people came last year?
• Alex: Over 500 students in two hours. And it was great PR.
• Petros: When was it last year?
• Alex: The Saturday between Reading and Finals week.
• Alex: Will there be fluffy dogs with waggy tails?
• Alex: Yes, and there will be hopefully 2 shifts of dogs?
• Chris: Last year, it was advertised at puppies and it wasn’t.
• Alex: sorry that was PR not me.
• Ani: POI-Can’t bring puppies, because puppies are too fragile.
Good of the Order & Announcements
• Ani: We are handing out member t-shirts tonight. As Abby calls roll,
come up and tell us your name and you can get your shirts.
• Petros: It is transgender awareness week. Next week, there is a
vigil happening, but it is during Senate so you can’t go.

Senate 11/20/2013

3/5/14 8:59 AM

Call to Order and Roll Call
Approval of the Journal: Available at bit.ly/ASG-Senate-Minutes.
Executive Board Reports
Student Group Spotlight: College Republicans’ Freedom Week
Special Order: Typhoon Haiyan Relief Presentation
General Order: 10K Launch Presentation
Old Business: A-Status Funding
Katie: Siddiq do you have anything you’d like to say before we get started?
Siddiq: There are a bunch of organizations that are A status groups that put
on a lot of the big programming on campus. Each AE has a few groups that
they help each year and they go to all the programming that the groups put
on. When funding comes around, they help Student Group leaders put
together a proposal and then we sit down with them and they explain what
they are asking for. Then we go through all the materials and look at the
different tiers they have asked for and based on the quality of the
programming we increase or decrease funding. Things we don’t fund include
food, alcohol and anything exclusive. When we go through all the funding,
we look at all the applications and try to distribute it as fairly as possible. So
that’s the perspective we’re coming from and a little background.
Katie: Any questions? Okay, then we are going to do a cut group first. I’m
going to run through a randomized list of the student groups receiving
funding. Now we’re going to move into an add round.
College Feminists: Motion to add. We’re moving to add $200 dollars to the
Vagina Monologue line item, we originally received $0.
SAFC: We’re comfortable with the $200.
Katie: Anyone have any questions? We’re in line for a pro speech.
Alex: Motion to Previous Question.
Katie: Anyone objecting? All those in favor, all those opposed. Passes
unanimously.
Caribnation: Motion to add. We motion to add $500 dollars to our
honorarium, which is an event to raise awareness about Caribbean culture.
SAFC: We recognize that this is a successful event, but it already received a
4% increase and $500 would not be sustainable.
Katie: Any questions? We are in line for a pro speech.

Caribnation: It’s hard because artists are always expensive and most of the
artist we’ve had have not had much name recognition outside of the
community.
Katie: We’re in line for a con.
Alex: Motion to Previous Question.
Katie: Any objections? All those in favor, all those opposed. The motion
passes. Now we’ll do another cut round. Now we’re open for another add
round.
College Republicans: Motion to add. I want to add $250 to travel.
SAFC: Their winter speaker has only gone on once and we fund consistent
events. It was a good event last year, but they need to prove that they can
do it consistently.
Katie: Questions?
Chris: Can you describe whether they’ve had consistent programming in
general?
College Republicans: We have consistent speakers and the attendance
ranges from 75 to 500 people.
Isaac R: Can you define consistent?
SAFC: It makes more than two and also consistent attendance. They need to
prove that they can do it and that the campus wants it, because there is so
much programming at Northwestern. Last year they used a connection to
get the speaker and we want to make sure it’s not an anomaly.
Alex: Can you explain the Young American Foundation?
College Republicans: I don’t know exactly, but I know they have bee really
helpful. They want to increase public engagement on college campuses. We
don’t know if that source of funding is sustainable.
Katie: We’re in line for a pro speech.
Will: We’ve done this event in the past without attendance so we stopped it,
but we’re trying to bring it back because of our recent momentum and
success of other events.
Katie: We’re in line for a con.
Alex: In line with what the SAFC has said, the fact that it’s only the second
time you put it on and because the YAF has helped you so much with other
events, I think you guys can make do without the funding.

Will: To what you said, I definitely understand what you said. If we keep
going back to them, we don’t want them to take away money from other
speakers. We need to show them that we’re expanding.
SAFC: We do operate on precedent and we want to be fair to all groups. We
try to be conservative and attendance is lower compared to your other
events. We’ll take the success of this year’s event into account.
Alex: Motion to previous question.
Objection.
Withdrawn.
Katie: There is additional time on the con.
Isaac: The YAF is a foundation that is headquartered at the Reagan Ranch in
California with an endowment of over 10 billion dollars. I think the default
answer for new events should continue to be no.
Chris: If you’re going to not give them a funding, do it because of precedent
and not because of Isaac’s personal knowledge of the YAF.
Isaac: It absolutely is appropriate, because we have a pool of money that
goes to student. If one groups does not face scarcity for any reason, then we
should focus the limited resources on where we’d have the most impact.
SAFC: What he’s trying to point out is that we look at need. But we look at
events, not groups. They are a great group, but this event is newer. We
need to adhere to the guidelines.
Alex: Motion to PQ
Katie: All in favor, all opposed. The motion fails. We’re going to continue
with the add round.
Alex: Motion to close funding.
Katie: Any objections? All in favor, all opposed. Funding is closed.
Old Business: SL1314-05: $hining a Light on $tudent Activities: An
Assessment of Support for Student Groups
Sofia: Basically the premise of the group is a working group of six students
that will assess the way the SAF is spent currently and how policies influence
that spending. We want to know what student groups want. Any questions?
Katie: Seeing that there are no questions, we’re going to go to debate. Open
to a con speech and amendments.
Isaac R: You plan to elect the two students today?
Sofia: Yes.

Mark: Motion to amend. Can we change the title to Ss instead of $s?
Katie: Any objections? No objections. All those in favor, all those opposed.
Motion fails.
Isaac H: Motion to previous question.
-: Isn’t it unreasonable to have the election immediately following the
passing of the bill?
Sofia: The timing isn’t the most ideal, but we’ve reached out to people and
there’s been a week for you to reach out to your constituents.
Isaac R: Is there precedent for moving it?
Dana: In the past 2-3 years that has not happened and you would have to
suspend the rules to do so.
Isaac R: Are you looking for students at large or senators?
Sofia: I just want to leave it open, because the most important component is
interest.
Lauren: Are the people being confirmed tonight?
Sofia: Yes.
Katie: All those in favor? All those opposed? It passes. Now we’ll move
immediately into confirmations of the SAFC members.
Siddiq: Our two members we are hoping to confirm are Jason and Amrit.
Amrit: We’ve been involved in a data project to try to get at the bottom of
this. We want to know what money is going to things that aren’t actually
going to programming.
Katie: Does anyone have any questions? Now we’re in line to
Isaac H: I move to suspend the rules and vote on confirmation.
Katie: All in favor, all opposed. The rules have been suspended. All in favor
of confirmation, all opposed. They’re confirmed. SGC members.
Addalina and Danielle: We’re both on the SGC and we are interested
because we are very active in the SGC and part of our conversation there is
how we can most efficiently allocate funds. I think we are particularly good
because Danielle does logistics of programming and I created a database of
our archives and internal logistics, so we understand historical precedent.
Katie: Any questions?
Isaac H: Motion to suspend rules again.
Katie: All in favor, all opposed. Rules suspended. All in favor, all opposed.
Confirmed, congratulations. Now we’ll do in-Senate nominations.
Alex: I nominate Katie McLaughlin.

Katie M: I accept.
Sean: Tori.
Tori: I accept.
Neel: Justin.
Justin: I accept.
Katie F: Any other nominations? The nomination floor is closed.
Katie M: I’m interested in this working group, because I want to get greater
insight into how it works. I’ve been involved in a variety of student groups,
but not on the executive level.
Tori: I’m on the SAFC, but I’m also the treasurer of a B status group and
have a better understanding from that. I’m also part of an organization that
gets outside funding and have had lengthy discussions about how NU
funding is different from other schools. This is very important to me.
Justin: I’m entering my second year as a treasurer of a B status group and
am also the treasurer of an A status group. I’ve been through many funding
cycles and am not a member of ASG.
Katie F: Any questions?
Lauren: Time commitments?
Tori: The groups I mentioned. But I’m only taking three classes and I’m
done in spring.
Justin: Just the two groups I mentioned.
Katie M: Senate and non-exec members of other groups.
Katie F: Any other questions? Seeing none, we’ll move into endorsements.
Old Business: SL1314-06: Dog Therapy Benefitting Northwestern Relay for
Life
Alex: Like we said last week, legislation pays for 50 dollar fee for dog
insurance, and 100 dollars is for suggested donation. Noticed in the past
that we ended up paying out of pocket very often
Maria: Main reason for application is because we will have suggested
donation for ACS of 5 dollars. This money you offer would support more of
the efforts of the ACS, so we don’t have to take it out of pocket and
maximize donations
Alex D.: If funded this year, do we have to do this long term?
Alex V.A.: We would need to pay at least 100 dollars each six months, so we
would need to find a way to make it happen or include in budget
Katie: Questions? [no questions]

Alex: PQ
Katie: We will move to a vote. Passed unanimously.
New Business: SL1314-04: Northwestern Crew New Boat
Kaylee: Operating budget is 80k dues and most of that comes from dues.
Dues are $1500 per year and there is a 2$50 fundraising requirement. It is
obviously a challenge to raise that money. Our budget goes to coaches and
travelling and equipment. As college students our budget, we barely scrape
by each year. We were the only club boat to make it into the finals, but to be
as competitive as possible, we need a new boat. A new racing shell is
$43000. We currently have $11000 in our capital campaign and are in the
beginning stages of a capital campaign. We are asking the ASG project pool
for $2500, but in all honestly, anything would be helpful.
Katie: We have 10 min for questions.
Alex: How many students would use this?
Kaylee: We have 20 varsity members. The 8 is normally rowed by our top 8
varisty women. So, 20 per year. You can expect a boat to last approximately
8 years on the varsity squad and 8 on the novice squad.
Isaac H: Why are you asking now?
Kaylee: We want to put the down payment now so that we can order it and
it’ll be available in the spring when we’ll pay the rest of it off.
Belinda: What is the number of boats you have right now.
Kaylee: We have four eights and five fours.
Belinda:
Kaylee: It comes largely from alumni donations, but our alumni are
relatively young because we’re a relatively new team. We also do
concessions at football games.
Isaac R: Will you need to replace any other boats soon?
Kaylee: We are trying to transition our team, so depending on the success of
the campaign, we might try to look into a boat for the men.
Mark: You said you were selling boats, can you explain that? Have you
approached corporate sponsors?
Kaylee: We had a boat crash a few years ago, so we turned it into a four.
It’s not being used, so we’re hoping to sell that. Because we’re a crew team,
it’s more viable to sell the naming rights to a boat, which is more likely to be
bought by a family. Corporate sponsors aren’t interested in this kind of
thing.

Isaac H: Once you sell the boat, will that be enough for the down payment?
Kaylee: No, we’ll need an additional $5,000.
Katie: This will be old business next week.

	•	Q: Take me step by step through the legislative process?
	•	A: Isaac: Would read through your idea.  Would take your through the templates.  Would schedule a meeting.  Would write the legislation.  The legislation would go to Rules.  Would be reviewed.  Would be New business, then Old business.
	•	A: Francis: The only other thing that I would mention, is that you as a senator who wants to write legislation can actually attend the rules committee meeting and you can be there every step of the review process
	•	Q: Can you meet from 7-9 on Sundays, and 6-7 on Wednesdays?  And have you run a group before?
	•	A: Francis: Yes, free those times.  In high school ran meetings for a certain club.  Also has sat on the Rules committee.  Thinks that there are a couple important things as a leader to do—to really keep people on task.
	•	A: Isaac: Yes, can make those meetings.  In high school ran campus congress (like ASG but in high school).  Would love to make the Rules committee accessible to the student body.  Only found out that you could attend meetings this year, but would love to advertise this to senators and students.
	•	Q: Isaac, you said that you were an expert in Roberts Rules.  Can you state the four basic motions?
	•	A: Isaac: Motions to end debate.  Motions to extend time.  Motions to suspend the Rules.  Motions to adjourn… Not really sure what you’re looking for?  There are a lot of motions...

	•	Old Business: Supplemental  Funding
	•	Emma Kerr: [Introduction] Every senator should have received a paddle—just to make sure that only senators vote.
	•	Wilson: We have two rounds in which we go through the student groups.  The first is a cut round, the second is the add round. [description of process of supplemental funding].
	•	Q: So say we’ve been recommended x amount of dollars, do we have to motion to receive that money?
	•	A: Emma: You will receive the money allocated unless there is an appeal

	•	Motion to Add
	•	Seconded
	•	Pro Speech: Co-Presidents of NiteSkool.  Would like to ask for $500 more for our spring show case.  While appreciative of what we’ve been given, would like to seek clarification.  Without this $500 we would not be able to put on a spring showcase.  There’s a lot of amazing talent on campus, and we would love to find these artists and share that music with Northwestern students.
	•	Questions
	•	Q: If we were not to fund the $500, what would happen to the $1000?
	•	A: That money is for our music video.
	•	Q: Have you considered fundraising?
	•	A: We have, but we already aggressively fundraise for our music video and it would be difficult to gain more.
	•	Q: In years past, you received funds from the school of comm. for the music video.  Will that happen?
	•	A: Nothing is confirmed yet.
	•	 Con Speech: This is more of an explanation as to why there is a changed request.  Originally, the artist showcase was going to be held on the Norris East Lawn.  The numbers that they requested were hazy.  We decided that it would be best to move them into the Louis Room, and we brought down their request from $1000 to $500.
	•	Questions
	•	Point of Information: Do you have a date for the show?

	•	Motion to add $400 for Spring fund for airfare
	•	Seconded
	•	Pro Speech: Treasurer of CSA.  Would like $400 for our speaker’s airfare.  We originally asked for $700, because we had wanted to fly someone out from California, but we didn’t realize there was a standard airfare number ($400) so we are now altering our request.
	•	Con Speech: Just to explain our reasoning—there was an insufficient tier and we didn’t feel that $700 was appropriate

	•	Passed (Allocating $400 for CSA spring speakers airfare)
	•	Motion to add $400 for Sound & Light to CSA’s game show

	•	Pro Speech: This spring we are requesting $400 for a fund game night.  Our original request was $1200, but that was from two years past.  But we are reevaluating our request.
	•	Con Speech: We would love to see CSA put on this event.  It was just a huge tier increase.

	•	 Pro Speech: We are asking $2650 for stage re-design.  Last year we were able to get the stage closer to students with a funding.  There was a miscommunication.
	•	Con Speech: The stage allows for less crowding at the front of the stage.  Was a simple miscommunication

	•	SASA
	•	Motion to add $600 to administrative line for a computer
	•	Pro Speech: Originally we were asking for a laptop computer, SAFC believes that all of our tasks could be used on a desktop computer.  We would really like to build a database on one computer.
	•	Questions
	•	Q: When you say mass producing DVDs, How many do you mean?
	•	A: Demand is about 100, but last year we were only able to produce about 15-20.
	•	Q: Have you pursued any other avenues for fundraising for this?
	•	A: Yes, but at this moment this seems to be our best option.
	•	Con Speech: They had originally asked for a laptop.  We have standardized the cost of a desktop computer at $600.  Also, burning DVDs is better on a desktop.
	•	Pro Speech: None
	•	Vote to allocate $600 to SASA for computer
	•	Passed
	•	College Republicans
	•	Motion to increase funding of $200 for spring speaker
	•	Pro Speech: Attendance decreased on their spring speaker, but do not think that that decrease merited a decrease in funding.
	•	Questions
	•	Q: What were you allocated before?  And what would you use that money for?
	•	A: We are allocated $
	•	Q: You mentioned that attendance of College Republicans did not decrease.  How did you determine that?
	•	A: We had a co-sponsorship the previous year.

	•	NCDC
	•	Motion to add $2500 to advocacy.  Breakdown: 1860 honorarium , 300 airfare, 100 ground transportation, 140 hotel, 100 publicity
	•	Pro Speech: We are applying for a co-sponsorship with FMO for this spring advocacy.  We had insufficient tiering and so we are altering our request.  We are applying for this funding to provide a great event.
	•	Con Speech: Basically it was just tiering issues.  Believe that $2500 is a reasonable number
	•	Pro Speech: Just wanted to clarify: the co-sponsorship is because of overlapping interests.
	•	Questions
	•	Q: Can you tell us a little about the planned event
	•	A: Looking to bring a speaker.  The spring advocacy is about issues of social justice.  We have already been in contact with the speaker.

	•	CaribNation
	•	A&O
	•	Motion to add $1600 to line item staging and $1600 to line item lighting and  $5672 to honorarium 
	•	Pro Speech: DM and A&O are co-sponsoring this event.  A&O traditionally has a very successful spring concert.  DM thinks it would be great to work with them.  This is an event that A&O has traditionally co-sponsored with another group, but they have decided to change.
	•	Questions
	•	Q: How much of an increase is this?
	•	A: All told, this funding increase gets us back to the amount we were funded last year.
	•	Q: How much money was raised for DM from this event last year?
	•	A: Wasn’t actually with DM.
	•	Q: How would DM plan on helping with this event?
	•	A: We a large organization and would help with promotion and in any other ways.
	•	Q: What have you done to green your practices this year?
	•	A: Actually changed our car practices to be more green.
	•	Q: How much are you planning on charging for tickets?
	•	A: Not set yet, but previously charged $5, and do not see any reason for an increase.
	•	Con Speech: We support this event.  It has been successful in the past.  However, if you look at the event and how it was put on last year, attendance was subjective, and some sources say that there was a slight decrease in attendance.  Therefore we believe that we should reflect this decrease in funding.  We also don’t understand how well this new pairing will operate.
	•	Question
	•	Q: How sure is this attendance decrease?
	•	A: We are actually in support of certain line item increases, and if they amend their request we will happily fund it.
	•	Pro Speech: Head count was difficult.  Contacted the police to see if they had an estimate, but even they said that it was hard to tell.  But would be open to a friendly amendment for a slight decrease.
	•	Con Speech: Want to move away from attendance issues.  But would like to focus on the makeup of this co-sponsorship.  While DM and A&O are both great groups, they have not yet worked together in the past.  DM is a B status group—they are a little less accountable to the SAFC and we are therefore a little cautious.  However, we would like to see this even happen.
	•	Question
	•	Q: Why do you think that DM as a B status group will be different?
	•	A: We have not yet seen how this partnership will play out—it is less about the group being B status and more about the fact that this partnership is new.

	•	Motion to Change Winter Comedian to Winter Comedian Series
	•	Emma: On petition, ask for Winter Comedian Speaker.  
	•	Pro Speech: In the past couple of years we were able to bring in 2 speakers in the winter.  In the past we were funded for one event, but we saved money for that event, and after we had to petition the SAFC for allocating that money to a second speaker.  We want to change the funding from a Winter Comedian to a Winter Comedian Series to allow for more flexibility.  Also, is simply more cost-efficient.  Both events will still have to be approved from the SAFC.
	•	Motion to extend time for 2 minutes
	•	Seconded
	•	Vote to extend time of pro speech 2 minutes
	•	Passed
	•	Questions
	•	Q: Are you asking for a loan?
	•	A: What ends up happening is that is a student group doesn’t end up spending all of the money for an event, it goes back into the pool.  Not asking for more money or a loan, but just asking to split the money up front rather than having to petition.
	•	Q: Why can’t you just fund two events?
	•	A: Just a matter of history.
	•	Con Speech: Is glad that this is coming before Senate.  No other group has this kind of discretion over their funds.  But they way the petition is set out is that there is no delineation of the speaker’s caliber.  Wants to hold A&O to the general guidelines.  They can achieve their ultimate goal under the current system.
	•	Questions
	•	Q: There was a point made earlier that if they had the flexibility to plan these events at the same time, it would save money.  Can you speak to this issue?
	•	A: They’re not asking to take away from the senate amendment pool.  They say that you can get “bigger bang for your buck” if you can start negotiating at the same time.  So according to NU policy, you cannot exceed the allocated budget. 
	•	Motion to extend time 2 minutes
	•	Vote on motion to extend time 2 minutes
	•	Passed
	•	Q: Has the SAFC passed petitions on short notice in the past?
	•	A: Yes, the minimum is 12 hours.
	•	Q: Do you agree with the concept that we would be able to get better speakers
	•	A: Having never been on the programming side, don’t know how much time is how much money.  But thinks that given the early funding happening now, and the speed of the petition, they can reach their goal.
	•	Motion to extend for 1 minute
	•	Vote on motion to extend question period for 1 minute
	•	Passed
	•	A: A&O’s goal was to send out 2 offers at the same time.  But they can petition to do that.
	•	Pro Speech: Just asking for a pretty simple change.  We’ve brought in 2 comedians in years past.  But basically we just want to do the same thing that we’ve done in the past, but with a little more flexibility and a little more cost-efficient.  We don’t think that we will be able to effectively work within the current title.  It doesn’t occur any additional risk, it doesn’t reduce oversight, but it will benefit students in that it will be more cost-efficient.  Believes that the incentive structure will be the same.
	•	Question
	•	Q: Just to clarify, if this passed now you would be able to start booking comedians now?  Whereas under the current system you would have to wait until winter quarter?
	•	A: Yes—if this passed we would be able to start negotiations immediately.  In the past we have had to wait until the first event has passed in order to start planning their second.
	•	Point of information: They can start to plan their event immediately under the current system:  but the SAFC wants to have a clear delineation between the speaker’s funding. 
	•	Motion to extend by 2 minutes
	•	Vote to extend by 2 minutes
	•	Passed
	•	Questions
	•	Q: A&O has a long track record of bringing great speakers, why can’t you just divide the line items?
	•	A: Splitting it into two would not be as effective.  This limits some of the flexibility in negotiations.
	•	Q: You say that caliber is measured by attendance?
	•	A: That is part of the caliber measurement.
	•	Motion to extend for remainder of the question
	•	Vote extend for remainder of the question
	•	Passed 
	•	A: Measuring the caliber is complicated—it is not necessarily only measured by attendance.
	•	Con Speech: The main problem with the petition is that we cannot treat A&O any different than any student groups.  All that is gained by this appeal is a loss of accountability.  Believes that there wouldn’t really be a gain in flexibility.  And a petition can be passed within 12 hours.  We want to stick to the guidelines that have been established in order to keep the best interests of the students in mind.  The SAFC really just wants a delineation of spending.
	•	Q: Are you saying that the SAFC would be willing to accept a petition before tickets were sold?
	•	A: We need to have delineation of speakers.

definitely taking a more holistic approach. There is also a lot of just
wrapping up for the quarter.

earlier. We will have another one in January. We also had the
holiday bash, and we are in the middle of debriefing a bunch of
projects. I am going to some alderman meetings this week. If you

student government members come in tonight, but they had a
scheduling conflict. Moving forward though, we are looking to make
more of a partnership with them.

super expansive spreadsheet. We are working with Sheng about
putting a calendar of events of A-status events.

Neel: Not too much happening this quarter. Just starting to prepare
for next quarter and working on solidifying our best common
practices.

Kaleigh: We are a university club sport and as a crew team we
travel and. We are asking for $4000 for a boat. We are fundraising
and we are looking to get the boat for the spring.
Member: We are a very inclusive environment. We have done many
initiatives and events to involve the community.
Kaleigh: We have an $80,000 budget that
Alex: How long will the boat last?
Kaleigh: It will be on the varsity for 8 years, and then move to the
novice team for 8-10 years. So they last for a long time.
David: Can you talk about where your funding comes from normal?
Kaleigh: we have $1500-1700 dues and we do fundraising on
campus. We also rely a lot on alumni support.
David: Do you know that most fund
Kaleigh: We do get university funding, and we get $10,000 from
the university. If we didn’t get the money from the university, we
would have to raise dues.
Siddiq: Can any student use the boat? How or could this benefit all
students?
Kaleigh: we do not turn away any student who wants to row crew.
Also, the realignment we would be able to do with the new boat will
allow us to have more seats for new students.
Ani: Why are you coming before the aggressive capital campaign
you mentioned you were doing in winter?
Kaleigh: We need half of the money now to order the boat now to
be ready for the spring.
Eliza: What happens if you want to be involved but can’t pay dues?
Kaleigh: There is a CSI fund to subsidize some of the costs, and
you can do more fundraising opportunities to cut off some of your
dues.
Katie: We are moving to debate and moving to a con speech.
Alex: You guys are a great student group, but the money you are
asking for will not be affecting or benefitting many students.
Harrison: Motion to amend amount to $1000.
Senator: 2nd
Harrison: I think the story you are bring forth is very compelling,
but I think this is much more acceptable amount to pass.

Alex: Objection. This is still a lot of money to be asking from the
SAF that will benefit very few students. This amendment will
increase chances
Isaac: I have a question for alex. Is there any amount you would be
willing to pass?
Alex: No.
Eliza: Would you still be able to meet your goal you think if you
only got $1000?
Kaleigh: It would be possible but that is harder.
Evan: would you be willing to come back after your fundraising
efforts in the winter?
Kaleigh: Yes, but I think this is the best time to ask for this money.
We need to purchase the boat as soon as we can.
Alex: PQ
[amendment passes]
Siddiq: Would students have the opportunity to use the boat too, or
just crew members?
Kaleigh: We are looking to have some fundraising efforts to teach
students how to row after our season ends in the spring.
Noah: Motion to amend. Any money that is not used to purchase
the racing shell would be returned to the pool. I think this is a good
cause, but we don’t know how much the capital campaign will raise
so whatever money you don’t need will be returned.
Alex: Object. I just don’t think this is very realistic. If they are
trying to fundraise, we just give them the money or you don’t.
Katie: Pro speech?
Dana: I disagree. They will try to raise as much money as they can
and then if they have money left over it should be returned.
Alex: PQ
[amendment passes]
Katie: We are in line for a pro speech.
Dana: We have talked a lot about the amount of students that this
would be helping. This boat will have a much longer longevitiy than
many other things we fund on boats. And over time we would fund

Ani: There is something also to be said for that this group has high
prestige and goes out to represent Northwestern. We take a lot of
pride in this group, and we have the opportunity to help them
Katie: Con speech.
David: I wish you the best of luck on raising the money. I would
like to say that historically, I don’t think we have every funded a
club team. This money should be going to student groups that do
not have that funding access. However, going off what Ani said, it is
Katie: Pro speech.
Jamie: This is a group that normally does not receive funding, so
this a great opportunity to do so.
Eliza: this boat does have a long lifespan. They have 16 years of
boat use to expand use to northwestern students.
Katie: con speech
Petros: There is no assurance that the boat will be put to the
correct use until 2029. I think this pool could be used to for groups
who need it more and that would have more accountability.
Isaac: Is there any money in athletics available for capital
improvements?
Kaleigh: No not really. That’s why we are here.
Alex: We are giving up 1/10 of our budget for 1/43 of the boat.
Also, they may be trying to sell their boat.
Kaleigh: Our goal is trying to expand the program. We do not want
to sell our current 8 because we would like to expand the program.
Sarah: So any student can join the team?
Kaleigh: Yes, if you make it through your novice year, you are on
the varsity team.
Isaac: How have you historically raised money?
Kaleigh: Mostly with donors and alumni.
Chris: Hypothetically, if you don’t get this money, how long do you
have to order the boat, as well as if you do.
Kaleigh: We need to order the boat by January 1st, we need $2500
more. If we don’t have the money by then, we may not get the
boat until fall.
Chris: would it be more helpful to have a down payment that you
must pay back?

Kaleigh: I am not sure but I don’t think so.
Katie: Pro speech.
Harrison: If you remember Henry Brooke, a senator from last year
on a club team, he felt that ASG helped club teams. This is a
chance to do that.
• Parag: This money would help get money ready early so we should
do this now. I see this as an investment for the crew team.
• Katie: Con speech.
• Siddiq: This group will still function without this funding, while
many other groups on campus will not. And while the Crew team is
incredible, there are groups that cannot function without this
money.
• Alex: Again, this money I don’t think has the benefit to justify the
cost.
• Katie: We are in moving to a vote.

New Business: SL1314-07: Hoop for Haiyan
• Arshad: Hi everyone. This is a request for a fundraising basketball
effort to raise money for Haiyan. Just to clarify, no groups have
been tied to this event but things are going. I think this is an
opportunity to really energize students towards a great cause.
Based upon quotes, I have given an exact amount for the event.
This is large amount from the pool, but I think this event could be
really great. I think that this could raise about $5000. The Athletics
office cannot be financially involved, but they are getting involved
in the event and have student athletes to help facilitate the day.
The president’s office is also able to give funding, because I am just
a single student. The tournament can be up to 112 participants
based upon the bracket to set up. There will be a registration fee
and you will get a t-shirt. All the left over t-shirts and water bottles
will be sold. The plan is pretty thoroughly laid out. The money will
be going directly to effort groups and not an umbrella organization.
• Katie: 10 minutes for questions
• Dana: You mentioned the Hoop for Haiti event. Did they have tshirts and stuff?

Arshad: They did have t-shirts, but local sponsors paid for the
shirts. Given the short time span, we don’t have too much time for
it.
Chris: would the event still go on without the funding?
Arshad: Yes, but it would not be as profitable. Also the t-shirts help
create an outward appearance of this event is for a cause.
Evan: Could you elaborate on the $200 fee for PR? Don’t we know
have $50 PR budget for groups?
Arshad: This was just an estimate, and I would be open to be
lowering it if you are more comfortable with that.
Luke: how early do you need the money?
Arshad: We need 2 weeks for the t-shirts and water bottles.
Luke: So you can’t wait to pass this next Senate?
Arshad: No. We would need to make this old business tonight.
Senator: have you thought that about only selling the shirts?
Arshad: I am not sure the costs would be less than the profits that
way.
Dana: why did you pick two items to sell. It ups the costs.
Arshad: for the sake of variety I guess.
Korri: Who is your target market for the 88 shirts.
Arshad: supporters of those playing and then selling them outside
Kellogg if they don’t sell after the tournament.
Chris: What other areas have you gone to ask for money other than
athletics and president’s office and what did you do to minimize
costs?
Arshad: I haven’t really but I would like to make this a campus
wide event to unify campus. I want this to be unaffiliated to make it
as campus wide as possible. I also did my own research to get the
best prices to minimize costs.
Katie: We have time for one more question.
Chris: Motion to extend question period by 5 minutes.
Franco: This is just a single event?
Arshad: No I was just modeling after Hoop for Haiti.
Franco: So what is the purpose of having t-shirts and water bottles
to advertise a single event?
Arshad: the relief efforts are ongoing even if the tournament is not.

Alex: How long has the tournament been in the planning process?
Arshad: 3 weeks
Dana: Why are you holding it so soon? Also, no sorority women will
be able to participate and you can get more sponsorships to fund.
• Arshad: It was just earlier in the quarter, so people are less busy.
But that is the a good point about sorority women.
• Senator: What corporate sponsorships have you looked at?
• Arshad: I have looked at those who are were involved in Haiti and
new businesses.
• Parag: Could you push back the event to get corporate
sponsorships?
• Arshad: Yes, but we would still need to money from ASG to fund
the event.
• Katie: Okay this is old business in January.
• Harrison: Motion to move this to old business. I think he explained
why this is needed to be made old business.
• Chris: We also can use this time to amend appropriately.
• Katie: Con speech.
• Isaac: I think we need time to talk to our constituents and you may
need time to figure out some other details.
• Alex: We are in an awkward position, but I think we need the extra
time.
• Katie: Okay, we are in line for a pro speech.
• Petros: I think by holding the event as soon as possible to have the
most effective event.
• Katie: Con speech.
• Evan: I am fully in support with this event, but I think we have
seen that there are issues with this date. So, we could use this as a
chance to move

paperwork for Student athletes to be involved.

Evan: The World Cup is one of the largest watched sporting event
in the world. We have locked in the McCormick theater in Norris.
We would need $50 for chips and food. I have talked to ISA and NU
World Cup about PR costs and Einstein’s about free bagels. I think
this could be a great event that embodies what the project pool is
for.
Harrison: We are sorry to have to make it old business tonight, but
we the selection party would have to be on Friday and there was no
Senate last week.
Katie: 10 minutes for questions.
Alex: What kind of food?
Evan: Orange juice, cream cheese
Senator: Can you eat in the McCormick theater?
Evan: worst comes to worst, we can eat outside.
Parag: Motion to make this old business?
Alex: 2nd
Alex: PQ
David: objection
Alex: withdrawn
Katie: con speech
David: this is a great idea, but a terrible use of project money. If it
is integral to the event, that is one thing, but not the feed
attendees. If we wouldn’t fund a student group for it, we shouldn’t
fund it now.
Katie: Pro speech
Petros: I love the World Cup and that I think it would bring together
students.
Alex: I think they have done a great job of taking initiative to get
free bagels.
Kevin: Why do you need the money if you have bagels.
Evan: we need drinks and cream cheese.
Katie: Con speech
Ani: I think this is a great event, even from a mental health
prospective of giving money out. Also, I think it was a bit
presumptuous that I have already received advertising that said
ASG is sponsoring it.

Noah: This money is not sponsoring an event, but to feed students
chips. We should be helping new events happen, not funding
extras.
• Alex: Can you further elaborate on the advertising issue?
• Harrison: I’m sorry that was a miscommunication on our part with
NU World Cup on how project pool funding work.
• Evan: Maybe they meant that Harrison and I are working with them
on behalf of ASG.
• Katie: Pro speech.
• Harrison: I think Ani brought up a lot of issues that should be
addressed. As you can see, we are very surprised by the
advertising. Also, this is not haphazard. We have been planning this
out for a while, but there was no Senate last week to bring up.
• Katie: Con speech
• Sofia: I think in terms of fundraising the pool is an outlet and there
are funding outlets on campus that ISA has relations with for you to
go to. There are B-Status whose complete focus is food and that is
the purpose that put in a concerted effort to fundraise even though
their programming is centered around food. This event will happen
regardless and the event is not about food, it is about the World
Cup.

10K will be used to make some idea brought to us by the students
happen. We have done 6 spots. 3 ASG and 3 not. We will take
suggestions during Fall, Winter quarter we narrow down to 6, and
then we have Senate vote on what will be sent out to campus.
Mark: I thought last year it was benches in general?
Alex: I think that was the wording.
Mark: I thought benches and tables were separate.
Petros: It was combined.
Alex: Yes it was combined and we will be placing the furniture in
the grassy area by Scott Hall. There is a lot going on. Go to Campus
Voice (web address). It is a great way to gauge what students
needs are. Welcome.
David: Hi, I am David Harris. 4th year studying econ. My job is to

health minor. Please look at my exec board report. Annually my
committee does a Faculty-Staff Honor Roll. How many of you know
what the Faculty Student Interaction Grant is? Okay so we will be
working in coordination with them more this year. The goal is to
build relationships between professors and students, so please be
on the lookout for that. I have also been working on communication
ties with Student Advisory Boards. We will also be sending out
survey on academics.
Siddiq: My name is Siddiq and I am a senior and head of SAFC. We
have our 2nd funding cycle coming up. And we have a open position
so please consider running.
Neel: I am Neel, SGVP. At the beginning of the quarter, all of our
groups are going through a quarterly review. We just finished up
and now we are going through roll backs, which is money that
wasn’t used that will be rolled back. It is basically when student
groups aren’t spending money, so we will have more money in our
pool soon.

Kevin: I am VP for CR. So as a recap, we just help Big Bite Night.
Great turnout and students groups performing was new. Cats
Coming to Dinner is coming soon too. We will be connecting
students with Evanston families. It will be happening end of
October. We will be having a light walk next week, so let us know
what areas you think are dark if you live off campus. Occupancy
reform, brothel law, is being reviewed by Evanston City Council. As
an update, it has been pushed back again. Hopefully it will be up in
November.
• Noah: Hi, I am Noah a junior and I am Services VP. We on services
start with a operating budget of $0 and come up with solutions for
student services ground up. We are working on the Unofficial Study

Alex: We aren’t arguing about the bill tonight right?
Katie: Yes, tonight it is informational.
Carolyn: I am President of the Public Health Club. We are moving to
make NU a tobacco-free campus. It is a huge killer in America and
Illinois. Second hand and even third hand smoke is very dangerous.
There are 766 campus also making this move. It will benefit the
university financially and health-wise. It will cut down on littering,
health-care costs. So if you guys have any questions…?
Alex: How much weight would you say in cigarette liter is there?
Carolyn: I don’t know
Petros: Have you talked to the administration?
Carolyn: Yes, the administration passed a smoke-free bill. They
didn’t understand the difference between smoke-free and tobaccofree.
Mark: Can you explain the difference between smoke free and
tobacco free?
Carolyn: Yes there is a difference. This bill also includes ecigarettes. We are collecting all of this together.
Taylor: How will the university enforce this?
Carolyn: Signage and peer encouragement.
Taylor: What will consequences be?
Carolyn: Police can be involved, like they could maybe search
students if they found their activity to potentially be suspicious.
Petros: Will this just push smoking off campus?
Carolyn: That is a worry. But 70% of smokers do want to stop. And
there are statistics that prove that
Alex: Can you smoke while driving by?
Carolyn: Technically, I guess no.
Isaac: What is the current rule?
Carolyn: No smoking within 25 feet of ventilation and doorways and
in university buildings.
Harrison: If the language of the bill we pass and the Faculty Senate
differ, what will happen?
Carolyn: the Faculty Senate want to uphold the tobacco-free bill.
Senator: Why e-cigarettes?

Carolyn: There is empirical data that I have on hand, but I feel that
it should be included.
Melanie: Would there be tobacco-free products on campus?
Carolyn: NO
Alex: What would the implementation timeline be?
Carolyn: A couple of months.
Senator: So could students have cigarettes in their rooms?
Carolyn: Technically no, but that would be hard to track.
Mark: Who will be implementing this?
Carolyn: I don’t know yet, but we wanted to show support for this
from ASG first.
Mark: Should this be legislation so we can have action to help this?
Carolyn: I was told not to.
Sean: Can we explain the difference between Resolution and
Legislation?
Katie: A resolution calls for support and legislation calls for action to
be taken by ASG.
Arian: Does this to the possession of tobacco products, like if
someone had a pack of cigarettes in their pocket?
Carolyn: The whole campus would be tobacco free.
Arian: So would off campus students have to stash cigarettes
before coming on campus?
Carolyn: I don’t think that would be an issue.
Dillon: Why don’t you just make it for no use of tobacco on
campus?
Carolyn: It is a social norm change.
Petros: Do you have any statistics on use of tobacco on campus and
statistics of complaints of use.
Carolyn: I don’t think we have stats for complaints, but we do have
statistics for students who smoke.
Taylor: You said police officer like this because it gives them
greater right to search students?
Carolyn: It’s not to search students.
Taylor: So what are we doing for enforcement?
Carolyn: We won’t know that until further down the line.
Mark: Motion to extend questioning by 3 minutes.

Katie: Great let’s explain what this is. We have 10 minutes for
question period. And you can ask to extend the period by
motioning. The we will vote on it. For, against, or abstain. All in
favor? Opposed? Abstaining?
[passes by visual vote]
David: Are you familiar is with what COFHE is?
Carolyn: No
David: it is a collection of private schools that our administration
compares us to and looks to a lot for moves on issues like this.
What schools have adopted this sort of tobacco-free campus policy?
Carolyn: Some Harvard institutions, Stanford, and some others.
And a full list is online.
Mark: I have a question for Abby. Has this gone through Rules?
Abby: Yes. That is why it is here tonight.
Mark: Okay, we will talk.
Melanie: Have you talked to smokers about this?
Carolyn: Yes, and a lot of smokers are against this. But a lot of
smokers in the end are usually in support of moves like this
eventually.
Katie: Any more questions? Okay thanks Carolyn. This will be old
business next week and then we will vote on this.
New Business: Associate Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion
Selection Process Presentation
• Alex: Okay we are going to do a little presentation.
• Katie: Any questions about legislation really fast?
• Dylan: How many votes to make it pass?
• Katie: Majority.
• Alex: So AVP of D&I has been vacant since spring of 2013. Since
then we have really evaluated with our advisors, CoC, and others
on campus to really talk about what this position is. We went back
to the drawing board and kind of redefined the role better. You can
read this and there is a link in the agenda. What we want to
emphasize is that this position is simply a voice to Ani and I, and
we will be the ones speaking on these issues for ASG. They will
assist with me and Ani on projects relating to D&I. They will be
sitting on various committees that are pertinent to their role. There

is an Eva Jefferson day, an old ASG President in MLK Jr’s day, and
they will be working on that. It will function very similarly to Anna
and Sophia’s role where they sit on university committees that
relate to their role. Okay so qualifications. Most importantly,
experience in the related area. We want to see track record and
dedication to D&I on campus. Ability to work across various
communities. This position is open to anyone on campus, as long as
they meet the qualifications. If this is a passion of yours, please feel
free to apply.
Mark: Can you speak to the status of the group and how it will
factor into the process?
Alex: Sophia?
Sophia: We reached out to them over the summer and asked about
their projects. Some have left the committee, but are still working
on D&I issues. All have been reached out to though in the summer
and fall.
Mark: So there is a committee? Or would they have a recruitment
process?
Alex: Yes there will be a recruitment process after the selection of
the AVP. So this is brought to you, because when there is a
vacancy, the process that we are going to take to fill it must be
approved by Senate. There is a new selection committee, chaired
by Ani and David. I will sit on there, Anna, Sophia, Coalition of
Color co-chairs as non-voting members to share their thoughts.
Katie will also be on there. This mirrors what we did in spring.
Normally the outgoing member sits on there, but she has
graduated. Apps will be released tomorrow if passed. And then we
will use grassroots method to spread the word. Apps due next
Wednesday and approval will happen in 2 Wednesdays. Any
questions? I want this as clear as possible.
Elena: Are you going to be sending this out?
Katie: Yes it is linked in the agenda/
Alex: Also a lot of this will appear on the application.
Dylan: Is there written record of this?

Abby: Yes I am taking minutes. As Parliamentarian that is one of
my duties, and you can view the minutes that will be linked in next
week’s minutes.
• Senator: Do we get email updates about this?
• Katie: Yes I was going to announce this later, but if you are not on
the list serve let me know. Any questions about this process though
right now? Okay, great so we will vote on this selection process. So,
we will now move to a vote.
[passes by visual vote]
Okay, so now we are doing something a little new. We are swearing
in all new senators. This is new. We have a book but there are a lot
of you, so you can just stand up. I will now administer the oath.

Kevin: Fall light walk last night. It was a great turnout from
Evanston and NU. We took a Northern route to Colfax. We were
pleasantly surprised, but we will be compiling a report. We are also

to connect to Evanston residents. If you know any residents or
students interested, encourage them to sign up!

or ethnicity, but can connect with the 4 communities in MSA.
Adam: What events can we get involve in?
Cory: I have flyers. We have 4 groups, so we have a lot for people
to get involved in. I am personally hosting Serenity Nights for
students who want to talk about identity issues. We are also
partnering for CAPS. We also have a queer person of colors group
going on, and it’s about how people identify themselves. We are
open. WE also have Quench, which stands for Queers for lunch. We

are having a professor come in to give a lecture. We have another
event about the stigmas of mental health for the black community.
For Hispanic month, we are partnering with Latino studies. We are
definitely trying to get at the identity issues people are facing. We
are also having Festivale, which is a great way to get a taste of a
bunch of different cultures on campus together. We don’t have too
many Asian American events right now, but we will be having them
soon.
Order: SGC Confirmation
Ani: While we wait, the Happiness Club and I met with a group
called Give back?? Its raised over $16 million. We are having it as a
resource on our website and they are also doing a random acts of
kindness grant. It is a cool opportunity and get to meet people in
Chicago and help improve the lives on Northwestern students. It’s
not to time commitment or strenuous but and interesting
opportunity.
Katie: Neel will you introduce your nominee, then we will vote to
confirm.
Neel: We had SGC recruitment and we chose her from 6 applicants.
So you can start by saying who you are an your qualifications.
Saya: Hi I am Saya, and I am a freshman. I wanted to get involved
on campus and I tough SGC was a good fist because of the work
the SGC does with student groups.

Steven: What ASG committees are you involved in?
Adam: None
Isaac: CR
Katie: None
Senator: What is your experience with Robert’s Rules?
Isaac: Not great, read the Wikipedia page a couple of times. I know
it is to keep order, keep an open space to speak.
• Katie: I was student council president my senior year so I was good
with organization.
• Adam: Most of my experience is from ASG and my past year.
• Taylor: Do you have any other time conflicts?
• Katie: Church group
• Adam: I am on college dems and I very flexible.
• Isaac: I tutor once a week.
• Dana: Can you tell us about your commitment to ASG and being a
Senator?
• Adam: I am very dedicated. I represent in College Dems in ASG
and other student voices.
• Isaac: I am very committed, and I want to continue with Senate. I
held a fireside yesterday in my dorm about the tobacco-free
resolution and gauged their reaction to vote accordingly today.
• Katie: I am committed to staying with ASG.
• Dana: Jow do you work with groups if there is an issue of what we
should do about a piece of legislation?
• Isaac: I tend to look for common ground and come up with a
compromise. I think people tend to talk in circles when they are
trying to get their point across, and I don’t find that productive.
• Katie: I think I would look for our commonalities, and then bring
together the issues and try to find compromise
• Adam: I have worked with groups that have nothing in common.
Sometimes we don’t have the best agreements, but work with the
smart student groups to help get their purpose and point across.

Katie: Skipping second round if Rules elections temporarily to
consider this bill
Carolyn: only affect usage, not possession. No ability to search
students. In addition, tobacco policies have been changing all our
lives. Slippery slope, you can’t go back once you start. Initial
opposition, but it tapers off as time goes by and everyone gets used
to it. Tobacco free instead of smoke free, in order to include
potentially unsafe products and maintain uniformity in the
community. Also assures for promotion of overall health for the
students at large. Harder to pass tobacco free after smoking free
because of loss of momentum. Inclusion of COFHE schools in the
proposed amendments. Faculty Senate has already passed a similar
resolution.
Katie: 10 minutes for questions
Harrison: Isn’t tobacco free campus a misleading term?
Carolyn: Generally used terminology for these resolutions.
Jacob: Work with grad students?
Carolyn: Working with med school student.
Jacob: Enforcement on Chicago and Evanston campus?
Carolyn: Ideally yes.
Ronak: Talk to staff?
C: yeah
Adam: Have you talked to campus security?
C: Not yet, we wanted this support first.
Mark: People don’t abide by 25 feet rule, so how will this help?
C: Signage and also getting rid of ash trays.
Evan: What about staff and workers that smoke? Would they have
to go off campus?
C: Yes that it is what they would have to do. 69% of people do
want to quit smoking
Senator: Do you have any stats on here?
C: 3.4% and 12.9% from Searle
Taylor: Do you have any background information that this currently
is working?
Carolyn: The numbers have gone down since 2010.

Adam: Have you talked to any other groups or organizations that
have adopted polices such as this?
Carolyn: Yes….
Senator: How will this be enforced?
Carolyn: signage and will be introduced through spread of word.
Timo: What difficulties have people had with implementing this?
Carolyn: It just take times and changing the social norm.
Isaac: Don’t you think it is harsh to compare an outdoor smoke-free
policy to an indoor policy.
Carolyn: There is no safe space to second hand smoke and areas
are transitioning to these policies slowly.
Elena: Have you talked with administration and staff that will have
to enforce this?
Carolyn: Only some
Sean: Are there any specifics on implementation in the resolution?
Carolyn: No.
Mark: Why is this important to you?
Carolyn: My dad is in public health, and I have grown up wanting to
protect the public health of those around us.
Luke: Timeline?
Carolyn: It depends
Eliza: Are you willing to act as on an advisor for spreading polices
like this, if this were to pass?
Carolyn: Yes
Timo: What are some consequences of not following this?
Carolyn: We can give tickets, but mostly peer encouragement.
Dillon: If the 25 foot rule won’t work, why would this?
Carolyn: Its more about a social norm change, and its harder to
estimate 25 feet.
Senator: Do you have any stats on progress for schools that have
implanted this?
C: A lot are still in the implementation phase.
Taylor: Sheridan sidewalk belongs to Evanston, could students
smoke there?
Carolyn: We will work that out with Evanston health officials.
Katie: We are out of time. We now move into debate.

Dana: Motion to amend. Motion to put in all amendments in red.
“reads amendments”
Senator: 2nd
Katie: Okay we will now move to a vote.
[pass]
Katie: Great those pass. And now we will move into debate.
Petros: I don’t think that this is the solution to a current 25 foot
legislation law, and we shouldn’t put forth more legislation to pass
this. It is up to Evanston to demand for their policies to should
enforce there own issues.
Katie: Pro speech
Sean: I am not 100% sure about the this. I am more in offense of
what Petros said. This is a resolution, not a legislation mandating
action. This isn’t a band aid resolution, but it is for when they go
forth to those to who will find a solution to show that they have
ASG support.
Alex: Hi I’m Alex and I am here to speak against this legislation. As
students, we are adults and should have a right to smoke. And it
would be problematic to staff to go off campus. I think this
resolution breeds mistrust amongst students, and I think going up
to someone and a making a comment about someone else’s health
would breed more problems.
Carolyn: It is about protecting the right of non-smokers, not against
current smokers. We are choosing the right for a clean air and
healthy environment.
Mark: If that is the case, why are you supporting a full tobacco
ban?
Carolyn: It is move to support a healthier life overall, and we don’t
know yet the effects of e-cigarettes.
Isaac: I think that my issue with the resolution is that we are
inflating issues of smoking with all tobacco products. I like clean air,
but it is someone’s right to be able to chew or smoke e-cigarettes. I
think it’s an insane way to look at the world to ban things that are
bad for them. What’s next, cookies? I think that the school needs
less rules not more rules. The closest place on campus for kids to
smoke is Sheridan road. So, logistically everyone would go to

•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•

Sheridan road, the most populated area of campus. Is that where
we want all of the smokers of Northwestern to go? Think about it.
Alex: I can understand the issue with e-cigarettes. I do think that
we should keep chewing tobacco. People tend to turn to tobacco if
they can’t smoke to get nicotine. And chewing tobacco is gross if
you have ever seen it and you don’t want to do that either.
Sean: Would you be willing to amend this to be a smoke-free
campus?
Carolyn: I would like to keep e-cigarettes, but if it won’t pass than
this then yes.
David: Motion to amend to take out and e-cigarettes.
Carolyn: Evanston may pass legislation about e-cigarettes.
David: I don’t think that is relevant.
Kevin: It is still under consideration and it is still skeptical.
Katie: All in favor of David's amendments? Opposed? Abstain?
[Passes]
Katie: We are out of time for debate. So we will now move to a
vote.
Senator: Division
[10, 19, 8]
Katie: The resolution fails.
New Business: SL1314-01 The Never Ending Story of the 10K
Initiative
Author Speech/Alex: This is legislation that clarifies the initiative. In
the fall a survey gets released to the student body for ideas on how
to spend $10,000. We go through those ideas and then recommend
approximately 5. Senate then approves or denies those ideas and
they are sent out. Whichever wins the popular vote is then enacted.
A lot of things were passed, but never became part of the ASG
Code. Basically, what happened before was that there were no term
limits, which confused things. If that makes sense at all. You now
must be re-elected every year as an ASG rep. I also added 5-7
submission because that is more clear. And, yeah.
Mark: Why is reasonable similarity to other selection processes
relevant criteria?

Alex: We could combine ideas that are similar. Like benches and
tables.
Mark: Does that not read against ideas that are out of the box?
Alex: No, but if you think so we can amend.
Senator: We fund all of this now?
Alex: Yes
Senator: Can those on the committees submit an idea?
Alex: I don’t know, but it would have to work more as a trust
system
Mark: I don't think that is consequential. It is about finding the best
idea of all students.
Dana: My question is about change from approximately 5 to 5-7.
What if there is only 4? Do we just present a bad idea?
Alex: Ani can speak to this.
Ani: It’s more as a guideline to the committee to not cut so harshly.
Alex: Last year we got 300 submissions, I hope we can find 5.
Senator: How many people vote in the final selection?
Alex: I don't know. I don’t have those numbers first-hand.
Senator: We will put a threshold on how many students are voting
to see if it is worth putting forth $10K?
Alex: I think we do have a good enough turn out of voting to keep
this going. It is a yearly thing. Outreach is definitely critical though.
Dana: Point of Information: last year it was nearly 2000 votes.
Taylor: Last year, it said the money that wasn’t spent last year
would be rolled over. What oversight would we have for budgeting
and making sure we are spending the money smartly.
Alex: We have to give a presentation at the end to Senate about
where the money went, and Senate acts as oversight.
David: Motion to move this to old business.
Katie: Okay, that means we will not wait to next week to go to
debate about the legislation, but we will debate tonight and then
vote on it.
Dana: I object.
Alex: I would normally let this be old business next week, but we
are doing elections next week. And I want to advertise opening for

the committee. And right now there are no term limits. I want to
advertise 3 and 3, instead of I think 2.
Isaac: Why can’t we move elections back a week?
Alex: We want to get started with PR immediately. We did a hard
campaign last year, and I want things to go well again. And we are
already almost 4 weeks in the quarter.
Mark: We are not voting on new ideas, just to codify them right?
Dana: I rescind my objection.
Katie: We will not move to a vote.
David: I motion to PQ.
Mark: Can I amend?
David: I withdraw.
Mark: Can we amend or strike 3a?
Taylor: Motion to amend to say similarity of ideas…
Sean: Yes like similar ideas can be bunched together.
Katie: How would you want to say this?
Mark: Does this need to be in the code?
Abby: Common law
Alex: I just don’t know if we would be able to combine ideas.
Dana: Didn't senate do that last year?
Katie: Yes senate did that last year.
Mark: We all know what we are trying to say, but I don't think it
belongs in that section.
Sean: I think we can combine ideas to free up a slot, but I withdraw
for better wording.
Alex: I motion to amend, add “The committee reserves the right to
combine similar ideas.”
Sean: I like this. Yep. This is what I was wanting to do.
Katie: This would be section 4 and then we would change numbers.

Good of the Order & Announcements
• Abby: Congrats to Isaac, the newest member of Senate.
• Anna: We got 22 new members, which is great and they will fit into
good roles. Jen met with Sodexo about to-go options. Please give
her some feedback
o Jen: So basically, Rachel is marketing head of Sodexo, and
we are looking to roll-out the wildcat to-go plan. We will test
a pilot program in the west side of foster-walker.
o Katie: Any feedback?
o Mark: What happened to great room?
o Anna: Closed.
o Mackenzie: Can we use regular meal swipes for it?
o Rachel: That was the original idea, but it doesn’t work for
unlimited meal plans.
o Katie: Questions?
• Abby: Okay Senate Reform update. I met with Burgie who
determined school wide coverage for the Weekly isn’t feasible. Now
I am working on reaching out to each school. Weinberg is tricky.
School-wide emails aren’t really sent out normally and we cannot
go by department because those who are still undeclared would
never hear from their Senator. I will give you an update when I
hear from the schools.
• Harrison: What did Burgie say?
• Abby: Logistically it wasn’t feasible to send out school wide updates
and announcements about ASG. It is too cumbersome.
• Mark: Tuesday, Seed is bring Adrian Green from Entourage to talk
about green issues.
• Jaime: Saturday morning, 8-10, breakfast on the block, some
sororities are coming to together, $3.
• David: This Sunday, dancer registration for DM starts. If you don’t
know what that is, well you’re not living. Also talk and spread
interest. Also, let me know if there is any interest in creating an
ASG team.
• Katie: My sorority is hosting a slumber-party registered party. We
are also holding a Ztate Fair.

Special Order: Associate VP for Diversity and Inclusion Confirmation -Thaddeus Tukes

•

•

•
•

•
•

•

•

Ani: Just to give you guys a refresher on the committee itself, a few
of us came in and presented this revamped position. This position
was created last year and works under the Director of Student Life.
We updated the position description to include how Northwestern
approaches Diversity and Inclusion. The position is not the sole
person in ASG responsible to all things Diversity and Inclusion
related. They are the expert and the person of contact and help us
navigate issues related to Diversity and Inclusion. The position is
supposed to serve all students on campus, because at this
university we hold Diversity and Inclusion highly. Any questions?
Thaddeus really blew us away in the interview and touched on not
only the obvious issues, but also more subtle ideas.
Thaddeus: My name is Thaddeus Tukes, I’m a sophomore here,
doubling in Jazz Studies and Journalism. I applied for this position
because I have not only observed events last year and this year,
but also I’ve also spoken to many leaders and have noticed holes in
communication. I don’t see minority groups just as race, gender,
sexuality, etc. but any group that is underrepresented.
Taylor: One advantage members on exec have had is the time
they’ve had already. How will you start out?
Thaddeus: A lot of what I’ll be doing are things I’ve already started
doing on a micro-scale. Being in this position allows me to do it at a
larger scale. I don’t have the same experience they’ve had, but I do
have experience and knowledge that I can use and apply to that
larger scale.
Alex: What do you say is the most similar position to this one that
you’ve held in the past?
Thaddeus: I’m also the editor of Pulse Magazine and one of my
roles is expanding the magazine. How can we reach more
communities and expand what we’re doing. I’ve been in that
position for a year and it’s my most applicable official experience.
Mark: You are obviously very accomplished on campus and I
imagine you double majors are also time consuming. How will you
manage your time?
Thaddeus: It’s just a matter of changing spaces. A lot of what I’ll be
doing are things I already do every day. Now, instead of it being in

•
•

•
•

•
•

•
•
•
•

•
•

my own personal space, it’ll be in the public space. It will be an
additional time commitment, but definitely manageable.
Alex: When did you hear about this position and when did you
make your decision to run?
Thaddeus: I heard about it last year and didn’t realize that it was
open this year until a day before the deadline. Luckily there was an
extension.
Isaac: How are you at relating to people who are not a member of
your specific community?
Thaddeus: Even within my own community there are people that
are very different. The way I approach everything is very open. I
know I’m in a unique position. I’m the only jazz studies and
journalism on campus and I would like people to approach me as a
unique and open person, so I do that for them.
April: How do you plan to use ASG to bring together different
communities?
Thaddeus: The first step is to approach the student and faculty
leadership in various realms. If you get all of the leadership on
board and on the same page, it’ll be easier to connect the groups. I
will be going person to person and within groups of friends, but the
key thing is to get the leadership in on the same agenda. Then we
can expand and simultaneously become inclusive.
Mark: Have you had the opportunity to interact with the committee
as it exists now?
Thaddeus: No I haven’t. That’s probably because I’m not in the
position.
Mark: How do you plan to lead a committee?
Thaddeus: The best example I like to lead is being the leader of a
band. I know about egos and personalities and opinions. As a
leader, you have to listen to what everyone has to say and
understanding what we can do and what we can. Not everyone will
agree, but I’m going to try my absolute best to compromise.
April: How do you plan to get other students involved in ASG,
especially communities that are underrepresented.
Thaddeus: Leadership. I have to go to the people with sway and
have them explain how important it is. We need to impress on

•
•

•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

everyone how important it is to be a part of ASG and be able to
influence change. Leadership is the first priority, but after that I
want to work with that leadership to help communities understand
the importance.
Gio: Can you list off some of the relevant people?
Thaddeus: I can say I’ve spoken with – administration is a difficult
one. I have not yet been in a position to address them forthright.
I’ve spoken with the leaders of Alianza and FMO. That’s how I found
that there was a lack of communication between those two groups.
Obviously there are more groups than that. I do have to reach out
more to leaders, but that will definitely happen.
Katie: Okay that is the end of question period.
Mark: Motion to extend by three minutes.
Senator: Second.
Taylor: There are obviously some students who don’t think diversity
is important, what do you say to them?
Thaddeus: It really is hard to convince people who don’t see the
need. First, I would express to them the amount of resources they
would have access to in an inclusive environment. Friendships,
relationships, jobs, careers, everything. If you want to become the
best you, that requires putting yourself in positions that you might
not be comfortable with.
Alex: Who’s your favorite jazz musician?
Thaddeus: That’s a hard question, bro.
Angela: One of the issues in diversity debates has been the
emotionality that arises. How would you approach that obstacle?
Thaddeus: I would let them know that being emotional is okay.
Different experiences will cause emotional responses. What I will do
is create safe spaces. Yes this will be touchy, emotional, and you
might be offended, but we have to go there. I won’t say it’ll be
emotionless, but I want to help people work through that.
Katie: That’s the end of question period.
Mark: Motion to extend by 3 minutes.
Senator: Second.
Mark: The university is using the euphemism “uncomfortable
learning.” What do you think about it?

Thaddeus: I think the concept is good, but you’re predisposing
people to feel uncomfortable. I do like the idea of people being
uncomfortable, but it could be reworded.
Harrison: What do you see being your major accomplishments a
year from now?
Thaddeus: Communication, because once you establish that, that’s
how you get expansion and change. I’m also interested in mental
health and we’ve seen the consequences of ignoring our well being.
I want to work with Student Life and the rest of exec to help us feel
like we’re in a safer and more comfortable environment. We’re
young, we should not be this stressed. I don’t want to give a
general answer, but more inclusivity. It sounds ambiguous, but in
general we should have a safer and more comfortable environment
between communities.
Katie: That’s the end of question period.

Order: 10K Committee Elections
Katie: We will now move to the non-Senator positions for the 10K
committee.
Alex: The 10K Committee is in charge of conducting the 10K
Initiative. Fall is a low commitment about getting the word out and
getting students to submit the ideas. Then in Winter we narrow
down the ideas that then get submitted to Senate. Then 4 weeks to
the end of Winter, the final ideas get sent out to students to vote
on. Then Spring is about getting it accomplished.
Katie: We have 3 non-ASG positions.
Senator: Frances
Alex: 2nd
Harrison: Dane Steer
Alex: 2nd
Dane: What is going on? No thanks.
Alex: if any positions, aren't filled, I can just fill them.
Isaac: How? Your friends?
Alex: It is up to my discretion, but it will be a legitimate process.

Frances: My name is Frances Woo and I am a junior. I want to be
on 10K because I am very involved on campus. I founded a group
on campus promoting public and mental health. I am involved in
SHAPE and my Greek community. These experiences have given
me the opportunities to work with ASG already, working on the
alcohol working group and others. I really want to help the
Northwestern student body. I have great time management skills,
but I have already made connections to many people on campus.
Alex: What was your favorite idea last year?
Frances: The mental health one.
[Confirmed unanimously]
Katie: We will now move to fill 3 ASG spots. Nominations?
Harrison: Korri and Evan
Korri: I accept
Evan: I accept
Angela: Danielle Lay
Danielle: I accept
Isaac: Mark Silberg
Mark: Kind, but no.
Nevil: I nominate myself.
Korri: I am the Elder Senator and I am interested in being on the
10K committee because this year as a freshman I have been blown
away by how passionate the student body is. And I want to be an
active part to help facilitate having student ideas come alive.
Evan: I am the Allison Senator. I was on the 10K committee last
year, and I love working to make student ideas real. It is like a live
Campus Voice.
Angela: I am on SGC. I want to be on 10K because I think ASG is
an invaluable resource to Northwestern and people underestimate
the power of student voice with ASG. I think that is really
important. On campus, I have been involved in SGC since
Freshman year, I am VP of Finance for one of the newest groups for
NSH, and I am in an a cappella group.
Nevil: I am on Services. I was on D&I and PLI and that allowed me
to get exposed to many aspects of Northwestern. I am a CA. The

10K really fascinates me, and the idea of getting ideas and seeing it
through to completion I would really like to do.
Petros: What would be your winning 10K idea?
Evan: I am going to go with one that I saw last year. Sorry to be
cheating. I would go with an outdoor movie theater. I think it would
be a great way to bond the Northwestern community.
Danielle: More Saferides. More cars and resources.
Nevil: I would suggest updating the bus signs to track shuttles and
buses.
Korri: I would want to update Patten gym. I would want it to be a
more full-scale gym. I think it would help with late night workouts
and on cold days when walking isn’t very good.
Isaac: I move to end question period.
Senator: 2nd
Alex: Oh and Maddy Low wanted to run. Here are some notes she
sent me to read:
o 1. I'm Maddy Low, senior theatre major, environmental policy
minor, Chinese minor. I'm the senator for StuCo.
o 2. I'm interested in the committee because I think a lot of NU
students feel like there's a lot of bureaucracy in the way of
their voices being heard about suggestions they have to make
NU a better place, things that don't fit into the established
channels, and the 10K is a great avenue for them.
o 3. I'm currently in a show that rehearses 4-5 nights a week
(hence why I'm not at senate this week) but weekends are
free and the show ends mid-November.
o 4. I've produced student theatre before so I have first-hand
experience with how far an amount like $10,000 can go on
campus, and the proudest I've felt as a producer was when I
was able to not only say "yes" to a team member's idea, but
be able to support it with money we raised. I've been
involved with all kinds of activities in my four years from
Jones Res College exec to marching band to theatre to
Engineers for a Sustainable World so I've got my feet in lots
of areas on campus and think I would be a good candidate to

raise awareness and have conversations about the 10K
initiative across the spectrum.
[Winners: Evan, Nevil, Maddy]
• David: Motion to move SL1314 up.
• Senator: Objection.

• David: Motion to suspend the rules and vote.
• Senator: Objection
• Katie: We are going to go to a vote.
• Katie: Now we are going to go for a vote on whether to move the
agenda item up. That’s two thirds, so we are going to see the new
business SL1314 now. We are in line for an authorship speech.
New Business: SL1314-02: Increasing Dance Marathon Accessibility
• DM Exec: First off thanks for changing the agenda. As a bit of
background information, we strongly feel that DM is one of NU’s
strongest organizations. No matter who you are you can participate,
but the $50 registration fee does stop people. We are asking for
some money from the Senate Pool. The students would have to
apply for a scholarship through CSI to help them register to dance.
This is a registration fee and should not be confused with the
money raised for DM. Students who get external scholarship will be
considered in the same way as people with Northwestern Financial
Aid. One of our goals is to help people sign up who aren’t able to
financially. Any of the $4000 that isn’t used will be given back to
the pool. And if it is used, that shows we do have need. And
according to ISBE the reason most students are not able to
participate financially is due to the registration fee.
• Senator: What if they can’t raise the $400?
• Janet: That is a difficult question, but we would refund the $50.
• Josh: We wouldn’t give back donations, but we would refund the
$50.
• Sean: How much do we have in the Project Pool?
• Katie: $15,000
• Taylor: Why don’t you just waive the fees?
• Josh: We need that money for the actually production of DM.

Anna: And any money that is raised goes straight to the
beneficiary.
Taylor: Why don’t you get the productions money donated?
Janet: The money from registration fees does not cover all of the
production costs and we do raise money for it as well.
Nikki: Would this go to towards this year?
Anna: Yes, on the registration right now there is a box you can
check to talk to a CSI member.
Isaac: Is this something you are going to ask for every year.
Janet: We are looking for more sustainable resources.
David: We have talking to PTI right now. We are a sustainable
group, but we are in the position that we need those fees to make
DM possible.
Sean: Can you talk about your decision to be B-Status?
David: This is due to revenue fees. If we received a large amount of
money, it would be worth it. But since we would have to give back
80% of ticket sales (registration fees) to the fund, it does not make
sense for us right now to become and A-Status group.
Isaac: So you will never become A-Status?
David: That is not necessarily true. We are looking at adjusting the
rules to make it make sense for us.
Isaac: You guys get a lot of corportate sponsors. You would just
raise $1M instead of $1.4. So is that what you are asking from
Senate?
Janet: No that is not how our corporate sponsorships work.
Anna: It would be considered embezzlement if we didn’t have what
they donate for exactly go towards exactly towards that.
Sophia: Would you look at Student Affairs to get money, if it wasn’t
awarded tonight? Or would your return the money not used to the
Pool? So, if only 1K is given or even used?
Josh: Yes. We are making a conservative estimate.
David: The money could go back this quarter.
Natalie: Would it be helpful if I explained the SASF? This is a fund
for $5000 per quarter, and it is a fund that is used for any student
for any student group that demonstrates for need for financial aid.
The way that is vetted is that they fill out an application and sign

something that lets me go to Financial Aid to get a ranking. It is not
a perfect system, such as if you receive money from another source
for school. We are encouraging students to apply for this first, and
then this money that you are giving would help supplement that.
Katie: We are out of time.
David: I motion to move this to old business due to time
sensitivity?
Senator: Objection
David: We need the money this year and it would be negligible for
next year. Registration ends Friday.
Josh: Not totally negligible. But if the idea is about inclusion, we
need to make sure we have the money this week.
Senator: Would this make it old business and move to the end of
agenda?
Katie: Yes
Petros: You all probably set this time for registration a long time
ago, and you should have come last week.
Ani: As an old Speaker, I understand the importance of
parliamentary procedure. But, this idea has developed over the past
couple of days, and we have been trying to connect the dots. But
we are talking about inclusion here. We want to make sure DM is
representative of the whole student body.
Isaac: I don’t understand why you can’t move your deadline one
week to accommodate the procedure of Senate, because you are
asking for 1/3 of our money for the year.
Evan: I do understand what you are saying, but not making this old
business that makes this money useless.
Alex: I absolutely understand the objections, I normally would
agree, but this money will not be gone immediately. The money will
only be gone if students really need it. And isn’t that what the pool
is for?
Taylor: I think that one thing is being said is that this would be
good for our constituents. But, if I don’t talk to my constituents,
then I don’t know. Also, if registration for DM has increased each
year, then I am not sure why this would be necessary. And I think

extending registration due to finance concerns, that would be
creating more inclusivity.
• Sean: They came in here with a lot of background information and
data.
• David: If you were to talk to your constituents, they would say 2
things, “yes I do this money, or not I don’t.” So the money will be
spent or it won’t. And the bill is built for just that. As a long-time
member of ASG, I understand, but I don’t want this to affect
someone’s ability to participate in DM.
• Will: I think we need to be able to go back to our constituents.
• Mark: Authors, can you explain the claim that students don’t
participate because of the registration fee?
• David: ISBE analytics conducted it because they are much better at
it. I am not sure how they question is worded, and but I know that
need for a fund like this is needed. This would pay for 80 students,
and if 300 apply then we will take a look at they applications.

This will be considered as Old Business.

Working on the SAFC, I have noticed continuity working with the
student group is extremely important. Also, there is a huge learning
curve, and I think I am in a great position to help my groups
continue to be doing well.
Jason: I am a five quarter member of SAFC. I agree experience is
really great. I have help coordinate inter-group programming. And I
think that the relationships I have are strong and should continue.
Amrit: I am a senior and not to beat a dead horse but I have been
on the SAFC since my sophomore and have really enjoyed my time.

my student groups and I want to apply that to other student
groups.
Sean: I’m Sean, junior, IFC Senator. I have been an AE for a year
now, so I do know the time commitment. I have worked with 3 very
unique groups, smaller and larger. I have helped the smaller groups
rise up to success, and the larger groups continue to succeed. As an
AE, I have learned a lot and gained a lot of experience that I think
is very necessary for this position.
Tori: I was a senator until the end of last year. I am the longest
standing member of the SAFC and have worked with all sorts of
student groups. And it has been the most rewarding experience. We
currently have a young board, and I would love to see it continue to
grow.
Adam: This is my second time to run for SAFC, and I am very
passionate about student groups. This year, I asked Siddiq how I
can pitch in. I have now talked to 15 student groups, asking how
can we help them as ASG. Because what is obvious to an AE, may
not be apparent to student group leaders. I have been a leader of
student group, and I think that experience would really aid me even
though I haven’t served on SAFC yet. I think I would be an
innovative and helpful AE.
Will: I am a junior and a College Republicans Senator. I have
worked at 2 banks, so I think I can combine my experience there
and with student groups and ASG.
Ronak: I am an off-campus senator. I want to give Northwestern a
bigger focus of the whole school. I am apart of model UN, and we
raise our $50,000 budget internally, as well as working on our
current deficit. I have lot of experience with student group
budgeting, and I want to help work with groups to get recognized,
because we have a lot of student groups that should be heard, and

Siddiq: We do work a lot of hours but it is a selfless job. You have 2
midterms on Wednesday and it is Tuesday, and you have to attend
an SAFC meeting or else Blowout wont’ happen. When have you
Tori: I have a job offer, so school doesn’t matter anymore. I would
definitely prioritize the group over the school work and I have done
it before and I will do it again. It’s about programming using a lot of
money compared to one grade.
Adam: I interviewed this week with a student group leader when I
had to study for a midterm. I would make sure to make us. Also,
we could create an anonymous facebook persona, so all can take
advantage of asking questions.
Will: It is all about prior planning, so hopefully it won’t happen. But
if that were to happen, you need to make this commitment a
priority. I am apart of ISBE, and working with micro financing I had
a lot of reports to get in and prioritized ISBE.
Ronak: I would make sure I didn’t get into that issue. And my
grades only affect me, so I would have. I have 2 midterms
tomorrow, so I am experiencing that tonight.
Eliza: A&O Blowout, I had a lot of work, so did I have to pull a lot of
late nights. Yes, but it was worth it.
Sean: I think knowing what you are getting into before you do it
really is important. Being flexible with your schedule means good
communication. So working with. Also, I am a film major, so that is
not that burdening…were going to cut it off there.
Isaac: I motion to close question period
Alex: I object.
Isaac: I rescind
Amrit: Time commitments?
Adam: I am apart of the c. I will make sure that the student groups
that I work with will always be able to reach me. I have worked
with an AE and know the importance
NARS, NUCR, and Senator
AKPsi, and Model UN, but those aren’t too time consuming until
Spring for Model UN.

time management though, so I don’t see that as an issue.

that for a while.

and I couldn’t imagine not being on the SAFC.
• Adam: I think experience is essentially and I have that to be a
great AE.
[Winners- Eliza, Tori, Sean]
Old Business: SL1314-02: Increasing Dance Marathon Accessibility
• DM Exec: I think at this point everyone understands the logistics.
From our understanding inclusion is the end goal for everyone and I
know that’s a priority for ASG. The project pool is really cool and
using all the money is ideal, because it shows that there is a need.
The competency about us does not have to be worried about,
because we are going through the Northwestern department that
always does this. We’ve been asked why we aren’t trying to get this
money from other places and it is because we know that ASG’s
mission matches this initiative. This is a great way not to ask
students to single themselves out, but to give them an opportunity
to ask anonymously. If we get this from ASG then we can use it to
show the administration later on.
• Isaac: Are you putting any of your own money to this? For instance,
you could have some kind of fundraiser for production expenses?
• Josh: For us it is really difficult to distinguish the fundraising for the
organization and the beneficiary. For legal purposes, we want to
keep fundraising for the beneficiary. We are not giving Senate Pool
money to Team Joseph and we are not going to ask people to
•

•

fundraise for a tent and not for the beneficiary. Our costs go mostly
to put on DM as a production. We haven’t put forth money to do
this, because we don’t have the capacity to do so.
David: We were cornered to raised our registration fees. We are
have a lot of expenses and pressures that made us raise our
registration fees 11%.
Taylor: You said this was a short-term solution but you are looking
towards longs term. What are some of those?
Janet: We are hoping that this will be a catalyst for other
Northwestern bodies to help out in the future.
Josh: This is a conversation that would need to happen in the
spring.
David: We have already talked to PTI. If you think that we think
this is our fund, then next year you can turn it down. This pool is
for causes just like this.
Isaac: Do you see these extenuating circumstances being an issue
in the future.
Janet: NAA will be helping a lot more in the future.
Arian: You said that you may go around the conventional revenue
sharing. Are those conversations already going on?
David: That is something we are looking to explore in the future.
But I may have misspoke, but we are looking at our options for
more sustainable sources of funding for issues like this in the
future.
Ronak: Was the 11% inflationary, or reasons why you aren’t getting
as much sponsorships?
Janet: It is mostly due to relationships over the years with sponsors
and donors.
Josh: Each year we work to make the event safer and that is costly.
David: the extra costs are mostly due to a new financial system
that we had to use that was unexpected. But Northwestern is
working to help create a better financial system.
Taylor: Why wouldn’t you just lower the cost for student for those
who can’t pay?
Janet: We need a registration at X level because the revenue from
registration helps cover a portion of our production costs.

Taylor: Did you have an increase in dancers from last year?
Anna: Yes, but that doesn’t necessary mean it was from low income
students.
Isaac: I have an amendment. Be it enacted here assembled
“$2,000 be allocated from the ASG Senate Project Pool to provide
up to $2,000 of matching funds”. I think it is too early in the game
to allocate almost 1/3 of the Pool. I don’t remember even when we
took this money out of the budget, other than the fireworks at Dillo
Day. They said that they couldn’t raise funds that wouldn’t go to the
beneficiary. And I don’t think that is the case.
Senator: Did we spend the entire pool last year?
Katie: Not sure…
Alex: At the beginning of Spring, I think only $1000 was spent and
$5000 after that went to the project pool.
Isaac: I rescind.
Senator: Where did the fireworks money come from?
Sean: The fireworks are now sustainable.
Sarah: This is money goes towards production costs. This money
just offsets that for students.
Sean: They are B-status for a reason. On SAFC, we allocate $1.4M
pretty quickly. $20 for a B-status is a lot, and this would not be
much for a production like DM.
Siddiq: Did you work in a deficit last year since you didn’t get any
money last year from funding?

from our beneficiary.

apply as well. It is a great opportunity and apps open tomorrow.
• Alex: 10K will be launched on November 20th. So start thinking of
ideas. Idea brainstorming will go until the end of the quarter. Talk
to people
• David: Hey! So I have kind of a significant topic to preview you all
about. I have been thinking about Senate reform again. Thank you
for the input I have received so far. So for a bit of context, every
year I have been here, I am now a senior, that every year a Senate
Reform has come up. And while some legislation of some sort have
been passed to increase accountability for senators, but a greater
change has not been enacted. Currently, I see two problems
regarding Senate Reform. 1. Senators feel that it is just one
singular group coming up with the plan. 2. They present one solid
plan that you have no input. So, next week we are having an open
focus group forum during Senate next week. Also, a week from
Monday we will have a larger meeting for all students. We will also
solicit various members of campus to get their input. Then we will
devise 3-5 plans to then present in Senate to vet and then we will
present one final plan. Any questions?
• Alex: Do you think next week will be the best day because of
funding?
• David: yes we talked about it, and it should be fine. Also, fill out the
survey I sent

Ani: Also, one more thing. Please sign up for mentorship program.
It is a really cool opportunity. Also the mentorship program will be
apart of the PLI curriculum as well.
• Sophia: It is Week 7 for you all don’t know, so I have been doing a
lot of considerable outreach this week. I have reach out to graduate
students, advisory boards. So if you have any personal contacts,
that would be really helpful for me to pass along. We are following
up on library chargers. Looking at practicum’s and JR’s. Please also
look at the Student Faculty Interaction Grant. It is a really neat
opportunity and you really should consider applying.
• Kevin: I will keep it brief. We just finished brainstorming and we
are in the beginning works of starting projects. We will be helping
out with the Evanston downtown bash. We are getting various
student groups to perform. Also, look out for the housing fair on
December 4th, and we will have another in the Winter. If you are
involved in a student group that wants to get further involved in the
community, please let me know. We are looking to be a resource
for students this week.
• Siddiq: We are working on supplementary funding. If you or your
student group has any funding questions, please contact me.
• Neel: We just finished funding. And we have a vacancy on the
committee, so we will being so a small recruitment. It is one of the
best committees. We put on the fall activities fair and work with b
and t status groups.
• Noah: We started coding for the unofficial student guide and it is
going well. Course seek got access to Caesar, minus CTECs. For the
study abroad guide, we decided to do London, Paris, and Buenos
Aires. I am really excited. If you can help out with interviews, that
would be great. Contact me.
• Julia: Campus Loop is coming out tonight. I also have been working
on the mental health initiative. We are working on a lot of internal
and external outreach. We are also working on a history of ASG. Let
me know if you want to help out.

Harrison: hey guys, so same thing as last year. No changes. This is
an event for NUSPAN, a graduate student group that got spread t
Chris: Have you thought about partnering with other student
groups on campus? I think this could be a great opportunity.
Harrison: That’s a great question. You can pool resources that way.
NUSPAN as it launches into the undergraduate student body, we
want to hold a lot of programming with many student groups. This
event specifically, we want this to be a repeat even for NUSPAN and
working with another group would hurt us next year with securing
funds.
Chris: So as a follow up, I think there are other groups on campus
that could help out.
Harrison: of course I understand that the Pool should be a last
resort, but we have gone to all of the resources we have explored.
Siddiq: Can you talk about other events that NUSPAN has put on
and the results?
Harrison: NUSPAN was a graduate student group. They had a
speaker last week. We had a small fall event, and for a new group
and a fairly last minute event, I was happy with the 20-25 people
that came. We want to add something to the environmental event.
Siddiq: How many undergraduate students came to the event, and
how many are on your exec board?
Harrison: 2 on the exec board and I am not sure how many came
to the spring event?
Siddiq: Do you think that this $50 is essential for the program to be
put on?
Harrison: for the best and full experience event, yes I do. I think
that the speaker is essential and then that food afterward would be
it essential.
Chris: At first I felt like $50 was not so much, but now I feel that
we as ASG should be encouraging now
Mark: Just so you know NUSPAN has a student that sits on the
sustainability committee, and it has been a group that has a PHD.
There is collaboration, but not financial.
Alex: Are there any funds that are going towards the speaker?

Harrison: The speaker has been secured, so this is only for food
afterwards.
Alex: Is it okay for the funds to be allocated towards the speaker,
and not food?
Harrison: yes I guess that could happen. It is only an accounting
change.
Parag: Can you describe what you see as the future of NUSPAN.
Harrison: We want to discuss environmental events in the political
arena. We want this to be a policy discussing group, and I feel that
this event is the start of that.
Neel: The reason we don’t want normally give student groups food
is because we don’t find it sustainable. So have you looked into
venues that provide food?
Harrison: we did go to multiple different sources for food, well
groceries stores because we want cupcakes. I think that cupcakes
set a certain mood. We have looked at other sources, like the
sustainability fund. As far as the project pool goes, the pool should
be a last resort. We have tried to be organized, and we understand
that ASG should be our last line of defense and we are there. This is
a first time event. We want it to be sustainable, so we will not be
asking for further funds next year.
Katie: Question period is over.
Ani: Motion to amend to change the line item to cover the cost of
the speaker for the event.
Senator: 2nd
Katie: [Reads amendment] Any objections?
Sean: I object. Just seeing as what we have been discussing, we do
not fund retroactively. This event will occur no matter what, they
have the speaker. So, we should just fund the food, not what has
already been funded.
Mark: Just remember the pool is open for however Senators see fit.
Katie: We will now have a con for the amendment.
Adam: This is a more professional change. Food is not necessary,
and a speaker is more professional as well.
Alex: I don’t want a precedence that student groups can come to
Senate for food money, and a speaker is a much better choice.

Ani: To echo Mark’s comment, you can spend the pool money
however you see fit. I am just asking you all not to set a
precedence for food. I want to help student groups with this money,
but I want it to go to the speaker.
• Isaac: I have an issue with just misplacing funds so it looks like we
allocated money for a speaker. That is just disingenuous.
• Sean: We can just willy-nilly just spend the money on a case-bycase basis. Funding an event retroactively does not show
sustainability.
• Harrison: I just think retroactive is misleading.
• Sean: What I mean is that you already locked down the speaker.

New Business: B and T-Status Funding
• Neel: So we kind of change of the way we allocated our funding this
year. We used to give money for things like storage, but this year
we started with programming funding, and then leftover funds went
to public storage, etc. That is why the amount of public storage
went down form $350 to $100. We had a lot of limitations and had
to be a little bit stingy. We get about $11,000 for 80 groups. Next
week is when stuff happens.
• Katie: Please look over the packets we will be voting next week.
Again you can’t vote for your own funding and if you have any

 Michael: I am president of ISA. ISA applied for funding
for $450 for the annual winter formal. I was surprised
when we received no funding for this. Last year we
were funded. The event attracts 200 students and two
security guards are needed $300 is needed for space
and safety, and $150 for lights and sounds
 GE: We didn’t give funding due to lack of funding. We
didn’t see this as a priority due to lowered attendance.
 Neel: Also, we are only
 Michael: We moved an event from fall to winter, and
that’s why we had 2 events in the same quarter.
 Alex: What do you mean by lack of attendance?
 GE: I didn’t feel like there was a large attendance last
year at the formal. It felt very empty. That is why we
are pushing for funding for the festival instead of
formal.
 Dana: How much is being asked for?
 Michael: For $450
 Isaac: How much were tickets last year, and how much
will they be this year if we do not fund this?
 Michael: Last year $19 and that covered venue costs
mostly. So it is hard to say. Probably about $20.
 Evan: Are formals normally funded?
 GE: It depends on what other programming the group
is doing. And if the formal is open to the entire campus.
The ISA formal is open and publicized to all, but it is

mostly international students that turn out. Which is
why the food and film festival was funded.
 Michael: We sold last year around 200 tickets.
 Siddiq: Where is the venue?
 Michael: The Hilton garden Inn or the Orrington?
 Petros: Have you looked for a cheaper venue?
 Michael: The Hilton was cutting costs.
 Ronak: why don’t you just raise tickets prices?
 Michael: We want to keep it as cheap as possible.
 Harrison: What happens if you don’t get this funding?
 Michael: We will raise ticket prices
 Parag: Do you think there will be decrease in
attendance if the ticket prices are raised?
 Michael: Yes
 Katie: We will now move to a con speech.
 Harrison: I motion to amend the funding request to
$300 for security guards.
 Senator: 2nd
 Katie: We will move to a vote.
[Passes]
 Harrison: I think this is in line with what SGC does. And
I would like to see this event go on.
 Katie: Con speech?
 GE: We normally don’t fund events off campus
 Isaac: Didn’t you fund it last year?
 Neel: We had a surplus, so it was lowest priority but we
did.
 Katie: We are in line for a con speech.
 Alex: I don’t think it is fair to fund only a couple groups
for 2 events. We need to do it for all groups, not just a
couple.

 David: Motion to add $200 to the line item tents.
 Katie: Okay come up and explain what the line item is.
 David: Two years ago we received $2000 and last year
we did not apply. To be honest, we were kind of
confused. We understand that ASG can’t fund DM. We
are kind of the status of an A-Status group but we can’t
forgo the money from revenue back to the SAF.
 GE: Why didn’t you apply for funding last year.
 David: It was a miscommunication on our part.
 GE: How did you manage if you didn’t have that
money?
 David: we kind of just made do. ASG gives very little to
DM so we have to find other ways. I am being very
transparent here. DM will go on if we don’t get this
money. We requested much more money than we were
allocated.
 Neel: So the $14,000 surplus. We had an $8000 deficit,
so we really only have a $6000 surplus. We want to try
to save as much for spring funding. Also DM is a highly
functioning group. We try to only fund groups that will
not be able to do funding for groups whose
programming would not otherwise go on.
 Isaac: This is going to seem irrelevant, but I will make
it seem relevant. When you asked for the $4000, you

said you couldn’t extend the deadline for registration
and then you did.
David: I pushed it to extend the deadline because I
thought we really should
Isaac: did that have any repercussions?
David: not any major ones?
Sarah: where is the money going to and why is it
important?
David: the tent is kind of arbitrary, but it is our biggest
costs. The tent is a fixed cost, and gets higher each
year as we get more participants. DM will go on no
matter what, but DM has to be more financially tight
than I had ever really expected.
Sarah: Sorry I think you misinterpreted the question. I
just want you to clarify for freshman.
David: Oh, sorry. The tent is put on the east lawn of
Norris and where hold the entire event each year.
GE: Why $200?
David: Because that’s how much we have left. I thought
we would have a bigger amendment pool. So, I am
asking for what is there.
GE: So where would the money go?
David: if it is allocated to the tent, it will go to the tent.
Harrison: why did you not ask for this in the first add
round.
David: It should go to a group first if a programming
event for them would not go on.
Katie: we are in line for a pro speech.
David: If you had an unlimited budget, think about
what sort of programming would you spend money on.
Students put more hours in to DM than any other event
on campus. We receive money 10 fold, 100 fold times
smaller than any other group on campus. Therefore, I
think

Alex: I love DM as much as anyone else. But this is
pretty blatant that this we would like how much money
you all have left. There are a lot of events that aren’t
going on because of lack of funding, and DM must do
that too.
Petros: I agree with everything Alex said. In addition,
we should follow the recommendations of
Katie: Pro speech?
Parag: DM is one of the most uniting events on campus.
Eliza: as David said, DM brings in a huge amount of
people. And as a Winter event, we should fund this
now.
Katie: Con speech?
Isaac: Last time you came in, we had to move
something immediately to old business, even though
you ended up moving the date. So, I am very unwilling
to fund this amount.
Ronak: As David said, DM will go on. Have the money
go to an event that will not go on if we do not give
them this money.
Katie: pro?
Harrison: If the money is there for us to use and they
could use it, we should grant DM the money.
Dillon: We should not hold grudges against DM due to
what has happened in the past.
David: We did not extend, we pushed back. If we
misled you, I am so sorry but that is not relevant to this
conversation.
GE: I want you to know that by granting this money,
you are taking it away from another group. DM will still
go on with this funding, but other programming will not.
GE: I understand DM is a special case, but we have
standards that we must follow. Precedent is very
important for us and must be followed.
Katie: We are in line with a pro.

David: I don’t disagree with anything that has been said
in the con speeches. I appreciate the standards that
SGC follows, but I also appreciate that Senate does not
have to follow the standards. Just because some
groups, this money will impact them more greatly, but
DM needs money as well. As Petros mentioned, DM
does not really fit into the status roles. This is a special
case that does not really set a precedence. Like with
NCDC and funding candy, it’s breaking the rules, but we
do it anyway.

Assessment of Support for Student Groups
• Sophia: We are asking to create a working group. I thought a lot
about the framework. Student groups are a huge apart of
Northwestern. This working group is to examine that culture. NU is
being looked at to be increased. We want this working group to
examine how the money is being spent and the transparency of it.
We are spelling out a really loose structure, but that is on purpose
so that no one is hypothesizing anything up front. The reason I am,
as AVP am speaking on this, is because there are programming and
academic spaces on campus. And a lot of groups choose to practice
in academic spaces, which I am more proficient on the workings of.
The working group will be overseen by me, Siddiq, and Neel. We
are not there to run the group, but to guide the group. The group
will be made up of SGC, SAFC, Academic and greater NU students.

Life wanted to pair with us as a fundraiser. So if we get the money
for the suggested donation, all other donations will go to Relay For
Life.

we raise $100, that we can get it back?

probably wouldn’t have come back.

they help each year and they go to all the programming that the groups put
on. When funding comes around, they help Student Group leaders put
together a proposal and then we sit down with them and they explain what
they are asking for. Then we go through all the materials and look at the
different tiers they have asked for and based on the quality of the
programming we increase or decrease funding. Things we don’t fund include
food, alcohol and anything exclusive. When we go through all the funding,
we look at all the applications and try to distribute it as fairly as possible. So
that’s the perspective we’re coming from and a little background.
Katie: Any questions? Okay, then we are going to do a cut group first. I’m
going to run through a randomized list of the student groups receiving
funding. Now we’re going to move into an add round.
College Feminists: Motion to add. We’re moving to add $200 dollars to the
Vagina Monologue line item, we originally received $0.
SAFC: We’re comfortable with the $200.
Katie: Anyone have any questions? We’re in line for a pro speech.
Alex: Motion to Previous Question.
Katie: Anyone objecting? All those in favor, all those opposed. Passes
unanimously.
Caribnation: Motion to add. We motion to add $500 dollars to our
honorarium, which is an event to raise awareness about Caribbean culture.
SAFC: We recognize that this is a successful event, but it already received a
4% increase and $500 would not be sustainable.
Katie: Any questions? We are in line for a pro speech.

Caribnation: It’s hard because artists are always expensive and most of the
artist we’ve had have not had much name recognition outside of the
community.
Katie: We’re in line for a con.
Alex: Motion to Previous Question.
Katie: Any objections? All those in favor, all those opposed. The motion
passes. Now we’ll do another cut round. Now we’re open for another add
round.
College Republicans: Motion to add. I want to add $250 to travel.
SAFC: Their winter speaker has only gone on once and we fund consistent
events. It was a good event last year, but they need to prove that they can
do it consistently.
Katie: Questions?
Chris: Can you describe whether they’ve had consistent programming in
general?
College Republicans: We have consistent speakers and the attendance
ranges from 75 to 500 people.
Isaac R: Can you define consistent?
SAFC: It makes more than two and also consistent attendance. They need to
prove that they can do it and that the campus wants it, because there is so
much programming at Northwestern. Last year they used a connection to
get the speaker and we want to make sure it’s not an anomaly.
Alex: Can you explain the Young American Foundation?
College Republicans: I don’t know exactly, but I know they have bee really
helpful. They want to increase public engagement on college campuses. We
don’t know if that source of funding is sustainable.
Katie: We’re in line for a pro speech.
Will: We’ve done this event in the past without attendance so we stopped it,
but we’re trying to bring it back because of our recent momentum and
success of other events.
Katie: We’re in line for a con.
Alex: In line with what the SAFC has said, the fact that it’s only the second
time you put it on and because the YAF has helped you so much with other
events, I think you guys can make do without the funding.

Will: To what you said, I definitely understand what you said. If we keep
going back to them, we don’t want them to take away money from other
speakers. We need to show them that we’re expanding.
SAFC: We do operate on precedent and we want to be fair to all groups. We
try to be conservative and attendance is lower compared to your other
events. We’ll take the success of this year’s event into account.
Alex: Motion to previous question.
Objection.
Withdrawn.
Katie: There is additional time on the con.
Isaac: The YAF is a foundation that is headquartered at the Reagan Ranch in
California with an endowment of over 10 billion dollars. I think the default
answer for new events should continue to be no.
Chris: If you’re going to not give them a funding, do it because of precedent
and not because of Isaac’s personal knowledge of the YAF.
Isaac: It absolutely is appropriate, because we have a pool of money that
goes to student. If one groups does not face scarcity for any reason, then we
should focus the limited resources on where we’d have the most impact.
SAFC: What he’s trying to point out is that we look at need. But we look at
events, not groups. They are a great group, but this event is newer. We
need to adhere to the guidelines.
Alex: Motion to PQ
Katie: All in favor, all opposed. The motion fails. We’re going to continue
with the add round.
Alex: Motion to close funding.
Katie: Any objections? All in favor, all opposed. Funding is closed.
Old Business: SL1314-05: $hining a Light on $tudent Activities: An
Assessment of Support for Student Groups
Sofia: Basically the premise of the group is a working group of six students
that will assess the way the SAF is spent currently and how policies influence
that spending. We want to know what student groups want. Any questions?
Katie: Seeing that there are no questions, we’re going to go to debate. Open
to a con speech and amendments.
Isaac R: You plan to elect the two students today?
Sofia: Yes.

Mark: Motion to amend. Can we change the title to Ss instead of $s?
Katie: Any objections? No objections. All those in favor, all those opposed.
Motion fails.
Isaac H: Motion to previous question.
-: Isn’t it unreasonable to have the election immediately following the
passing of the bill?
Sofia: The timing isn’t the most ideal, but we’ve reached out to people and
there’s been a week for you to reach out to your constituents.
Isaac R: Is there precedent for moving it?
Dana: In the past 2-3 years that has not happened and you would have to
suspend the rules to do so.
Isaac R: Are you looking for students at large or senators?
Sofia: I just want to leave it open, because the most important component is
interest.
Lauren: Are the people being confirmed tonight?
Sofia: Yes.
Katie: All those in favor? All those opposed? It passes. Now we’ll move
immediately into confirmations of the SAFC members.
Siddiq: Our two members we are hoping to confirm are Jason and Amrit.
Amrit: We’ve been involved in a data project to try to get at the bottom of
this. We want to know what money is going to things that aren’t actually
going to programming.
Katie: Does anyone have any questions? Now we’re in line to
Isaac H: I move to suspend the rules and vote on confirmation.
Katie: All in favor, all opposed. The rules have been suspended. All in favor
of confirmation, all opposed. They’re confirmed. SGC members.
Addalina and Danielle: We’re both on the SGC and we are interested
because we are very active in the SGC and part of our conversation there is
how we can most efficiently allocate funds. I think we are particularly good
because Danielle does logistics of programming and I created a database of
our archives and internal logistics, so we understand historical precedent.
Katie: Any questions?
Isaac H: Motion to suspend rules again.
Katie: All in favor, all opposed. Rules suspended. All in favor, all opposed.
Confirmed, congratulations. Now we’ll do in-Senate nominations.
Alex: I nominate Katie McLaughlin.

Katie M: I accept.
Sean: Tori.
Tori: I accept.
Neel: Justin.
Justin: I accept.
Katie F: Any other nominations? The nomination floor is closed.
Katie M: I’m interested in this working group, because I want to get greater
insight into how it works. I’ve been involved in a variety of student groups,
but not on the executive level.
Tori: I’m on the SAFC, but I’m also the treasurer of a B status group and
have a better understanding from that. I’m also part of an organization that
gets outside funding and have had lengthy discussions about how NU
funding is different from other schools. This is very important to me.
Justin: I’m entering my second year as a treasurer of a B status group and
am also the treasurer of an A status group. I’ve been through many funding
cycles and am not a member of ASG.
Katie F: Any questions?
Lauren: Time commitments?
Tori: The groups I mentioned. But I’m only taking three classes and I’m
done in spring.
Justin: Just the two groups I mentioned.
Katie M: Senate and non-exec members of other groups.
Katie F: Any other questions? Seeing none, we’ll move into endorsements.
Old Business: SL1314-06: Dog Therapy Benefitting Northwestern Relay for
Life
Alex: Like we said last week, legislation pays for 50 dollar fee for dog
insurance, and 100 dollars is for suggested donation. Noticed in the past
that we ended up paying out of pocket very often
Maria: Main reason for application is because we will have suggested
donation for ACS of 5 dollars. This money you offer would support more of
the efforts of the ACS, so we don’t have to take it out of pocket and
maximize donations
Alex D.: If funded this year, do we have to do this long term?
Alex V.A.: We would need to pay at least 100 dollars each six months, so we
would need to find a way to make it happen or include in budget
Katie: Questions? [no questions]

Alex: PQ
Katie: We will move to a vote. Passed unanimously.
New Business: SL1314-04: Northwestern Crew New Boat
Kaylee: Operating budget is 80k dues and most of that comes from dues.
Dues are $1500 per year and there is a 2$50 fundraising requirement. It is
obviously a challenge to raise that money. Our budget goes to coaches and
travelling and equipment. As college students our budget, we barely scrape
by each year. We were the only club boat to make it into the finals, but to be
as competitive as possible, we need a new boat. A new racing shell is
$43000. We currently have $11000 in our capital campaign and are in the
beginning stages of a capital campaign. We are asking the ASG project pool
for $2500, but in all honestly, anything would be helpful.
Katie: We have 10 min for questions.
Alex: How many students would use this?
Kaylee: We have 20 varsity members. The 8 is normally rowed by our top 8
varisty women. So, 20 per year. You can expect a boat to last approximately
8 years on the varsity squad and 8 on the novice squad.
Isaac H: Why are you asking now?
Kaylee: We want to put the down payment now so that we can order it and
it’ll be available in the spring when we’ll pay the rest of it off.
Belinda: What is the number of boats you have right now.
Kaylee: We have four eights and five fours.
Belinda:
Kaylee: It comes largely from alumni donations, but our alumni are
relatively young because we’re a relatively new team. We also do
concessions at football games.
Isaac R: Will you need to replace any other boats soon?
Kaylee: We are trying to transition our team, so depending on the success of
the campaign, we might try to look into a boat for the men.
Mark: You said you were selling boats, can you explain that? Have you
approached corporate sponsors?
Kaylee: We had a boat crash a few years ago, so we turned it into a four.
It’s not being used, so we’re hoping to sell that. Because we’re a crew team,
it’s more viable to sell the naming rights to a boat, which is more likely to be
bought by a family. Corporate sponsors aren’t interested in this kind of
thing.

Isaac H: Once you sell the boat, will that be enough for the down payment?
Kaylee: No, we’ll need an additional $5,000.
Katie: This will be old business next week.

definitely taking a more holistic approach. There is also a lot of just
wrapping up for the quarter.
• Kevin: We had the housing fair which you heard about a little more
earlier. We will have another one in January. We also had the
holiday bash, and we are in the middle of debriefing a bunch of
projects. I am going to some alderman meetings this week. If you
want more info, I can fill you in. We were supposed to have ETHS
student government members come in tonight, but they had a
scheduling conflict. Moving forward though, we are looking to make
more of a partnership with them.
• Siddiq: Not much to say this week. We are working to making this
super expansive spreadsheet. We are working with Sheng about
putting a calendar of events of A-status events.

Neel: Not too much happening this quarter. Just starting to prepare
for next quarter and working on solidifying our best common
practices.
• Noah: I have started interviewing new potential committee

Kaleigh: We are a university club sport and as a crew team we
travel and. We are asking for $4000 for a boat. We are fundraising
and we are looking to get the boat for the spring.
Member: We are a very inclusive environment. We have done many
initiatives and events to involve the community.
Kaleigh: We have an $80,000 budget that
Alex: How long will the boat last?
Kaleigh: It will be on the varsity for 8 years, and then move to the
novice team for 8-10 years. So they last for a long time.
David: Can you talk about where your funding comes from normal?
Kaleigh: we have $1500-1700 dues and we do fundraising on
campus. We also rely a lot on alumni support.
David: Do you know that most fund
Kaleigh: We do get university funding, and we get $10,000 from
the university. If we didn’t get the money from the university, we
would have to raise dues.
Siddiq: Can any student use the boat? How or could this benefit all
students?
Kaleigh: we do not turn away any student who wants to row crew.
Also, the realignment we would be able to do with the new boat will
allow us to have more seats for new students.
Ani: Why are you coming before the aggressive capital campaign
you mentioned you were doing in winter?
Kaleigh: We need half of the money now to order the boat now to
be ready for the spring.
Eliza: What happens if you want to be involved but can’t pay dues?
Kaleigh: There is a CSI fund to subsidize some of the costs, and
you can do more fundraising opportunities to cut off some of your
dues.
Katie: We are moving to debate and moving to a con speech.
Alex: You guys are a great student group, but the money you are
asking for will not be affecting or benefitting many students.
Harrison: Motion to amend amount to $1000.
Senator: 2nd
Harrison: I think the story you are bring forth is very compelling,
but I think this is much more acceptable amount to pass.

Alex: Objection. This is still a lot of money to be asking from the
SAF that will benefit very few students. This amendment will
increase chances
Isaac: I have a question for alex. Is there any amount you would be
willing to pass?
Alex: No.
Eliza: Would you still be able to meet your goal you think if you
only got $1000?
Kaleigh: It would be possible but that is harder.
Evan: would you be willing to come back after your fundraising
efforts in the winter?
Kaleigh: Yes, but I think this is the best time to ask for this money.
We need to purchase the boat as soon as we can.
Alex: PQ
[amendment passes]
Siddiq: Would students have the opportunity to use the boat too, or
just crew members?
Kaleigh: We are looking to have some fundraising efforts to teach
students how to row after our season ends in the spring.
Noah: Motion to amend. Any money that is not used to purchase
the racing shell would be returned to the pool. I think this is a good
cause, but we don’t know how much the capital campaign will raise
so whatever money you don’t need will be returned.
Alex: Object. I just don’t think this is very realistic. If they are
trying to fundraise, we just give them the money or you don’t.
Katie: Pro speech?
Dana: I disagree. They will try to raise as much money as they can
and then if they have money left over it should be returned.
Alex: PQ
[amendment passes]
Katie: We are in line for a pro speech.
Dana: We have talked a lot about the amount of students that this
would be helping. This boat will have a much longer longevitiy than
many other things we fund on boats. And over time we would fund

Ani: There is something also to be said for that this group has high
prestige and goes out to represent Northwestern. We take a lot of
pride in this group, and we have the opportunity to help them
Katie: Con speech.
David: I wish you the best of luck on raising the money. I would
like to say that historically, I don’t think we have every funded a
club team. This money should be going to student groups that do
not have that funding access. However, going off what Ani said, it is
Katie: Pro speech.
Jamie: This is a group that normally does not receive funding, so
this a great opportunity to do so.
Eliza: this boat does have a long lifespan. They have 16 years of
boat use to expand use to northwestern students.
Katie: con speech
Petros: There is no assurance that the boat will be put to the
correct use until 2029. I think this pool could be used to for groups
who need it more and that would have more accountability.
Isaac: Is there any money in athletics available for capital
improvements?
Kaleigh: No not really. That’s why we are here.
Alex: We are giving up 1/10 of our budget for 1/43 of the boat.
Also, they may be trying to sell their boat.
Kaleigh: Our goal is trying to expand the program. We do not want
to sell our current 8 because we would like to expand the program.
Sarah: So any student can join the team?
Kaleigh: Yes, if you make it through your novice year, you are on
the varsity team.
Isaac: How have you historically raised money?
Kaleigh: Mostly with donors and alumni.
Chris: Hypothetically, if you don’t get this money, how long do you
have to order the boat, as well as if you do.
Kaleigh: We need to order the boat by January 1st, we need $2500
more. If we don’t have the money by then, we may not get the
boat until fall.
Chris: would it be more helpful to have a down payment that you
must pay back?

Kaleigh: I am not sure but I don’t think so.
Katie: Pro speech.
Harrison: If you remember Henry Brooke, a senator from last year
on a club team, he felt that ASG helped club teams. This is a
chance to do that.
• Parag: This money would help get money ready early so we should
do this now. I see this as an investment for the crew team.
• Katie: Con speech.
• Siddiq: This group will still function without this funding, while
many other groups on campus will not. And while the Crew team is
incredible, there are groups that cannot function without this
money.
• Alex: Again, this money I don’t think has the benefit to justify the
cost.
• Katie: We are in moving to a vote.
[legislation passes]
New Business: SL1314-07: Hoop for Haiyan
• Arshad: Hi everyone. This is a request for a fundraising basketball
effort to raise money for Haiyan. Just to clarify, no groups have
been tied to this event but things are going. I think this is an
opportunity to really energize students towards a great cause.
Based upon quotes, I have given an exact amount for the event.
This is large amount from the pool, but I think this event could be
really great. I think that this could raise about $5000. The Athletics
office cannot be financially involved, but they are getting involved
in the event and have student athletes to help facilitate the day.
The president’s office is also able to give funding, because I am just
a single student. The tournament can be up to 112 participants
based upon the bracket to set up. There will be a registration fee
and you will get a t-shirt. All the left over t-shirts and water bottles
will be sold. The plan is pretty thoroughly laid out. The money will
be going directly to effort groups and not an umbrella organization.
• Katie: 10 minutes for questions
• Dana: You mentioned the Hoop for Haiti event. Did they have tshirts and stuff?

Arshad: They did have t-shirts, but local sponsors paid for the
shirts. Given the short time span, we don’t have too much time for
it.
Chris: would the event still go on without the funding?
Arshad: Yes, but it would not be as profitable. Also the t-shirts help
create an outward appearance of this event is for a cause.
Evan: Could you elaborate on the $200 fee for PR? Don’t we know
have $50 PR budget for groups?
Arshad: This was just an estimate, and I would be open to be
lowering it if you are more comfortable with that.
Luke: how early do you need the money?
Arshad: We need 2 weeks for the t-shirts and water bottles.
Luke: So you can’t wait to pass this next Senate?
Arshad: No. We would need to make this old business tonight.
Senator: have you thought that about only selling the shirts?
Arshad: I am not sure the costs would be less than the profits that
way.
Dana: why did you pick two items to sell. It ups the costs.
Arshad: for the sake of variety I guess.
Korri: Who is your target market for the 88 shirts.
Arshad: supporters of those playing and then selling them outside
Kellogg if they don’t sell after the tournament.
Chris: What other areas have you gone to ask for money other than
athletics and president’s office and what did you do to minimize
costs?
Arshad: I haven’t really but I would like to make this a campus
wide event to unify campus. I want this to be unaffiliated to make it
as campus wide as possible. I also did my own research to get the
best prices to minimize costs.
Katie: We have time for one more question.
Chris: Motion to extend question period by 5 minutes.
Franco: This is just a single event?
Arshad: No I was just modeling after Hoop for Haiti.
Franco: So what is the purpose of having t-shirts and water bottles
to advertise a single event?
Arshad: the relief efforts are ongoing even if the tournament is not.

Alex: How long has the tournament been in the planning process?
Arshad: 3 weeks
Dana: Why are you holding it so soon? Also, no sorority women will
be able to participate and you can get more sponsorships to fund.
• Arshad: It was just earlier in the quarter, so people are less busy.
But that is the a good point about sorority women.
• Senator: What corporate sponsorships have you looked at?
• Arshad: I have looked at those who are were involved in Haiti and
new businesses.
• Parag: Could you push back the event to get corporate
sponsorships?
• Arshad: Yes, but we would still need to money from ASG to fund
the event.
• Katie: Okay this is old business in January.
• Harrison: Motion to move this to old business. I think he explained
why this is needed to be made old business.
• Chris: We also can use this time to amend appropriately.
• Katie: Con speech.
• Isaac: I think we need time to talk to our constituents and you may
need time to figure out some other details.
• Alex: We are in an awkward position, but I think we need the extra
time.
• Katie: Okay, we are in line for a pro speech.
• Petros: I think by holding the event as soon as possible to have the
most effective event.
• Katie: Con speech.
• Evan: I am fully in support with this event, but I think we have
seen that there are issues with this date. So, we could use this as a
chance to move

paperwork for Student athletes to be involved.

Evan: The World Cup is one of the largest watched sporting event
in the world. We have locked in the McCormick theater in Norris.
We would need $50 for chips and food. I have talked to ISA and NU
World Cup about PR costs and Einstein’s about free bagels. I think
this could be a great event that embodies what the project pool is
for.
Harrison: We are sorry to have to make it old business tonight, but
we the selection party would have to be on Friday and there was no
Senate last week.
Katie: 10 minutes for questions.
Alex: What kind of food?
Evan: Orange juice, cream cheese
Senator: Can you eat in the McCormick theater?
Evan: worst comes to worst, we can eat outside.
Parag: Motion to make this old business?
Alex: 2nd
Alex: PQ
David: objection
Alex: withdrawn
Katie: con speech
David: this is a great idea, but a terrible use of project money. If it
is integral to the event, that is one thing, but not the feed
attendees. If we wouldn’t fund a student group for it, we shouldn’t
fund it now.
Katie: Pro speech
Petros: I love the World Cup and that I think it would bring together
students.
Alex: I think they have done a great job of taking initiative to get
free bagels.
Kevin: Why do you need the money if you have bagels.
Evan: we need drinks and cream cheese.
Katie: Con speech
Ani: I think this is a great event, even from a mental health
prospective of giving money out. Also, I think it was a bit
presumptuous that I have already received advertising that said
ASG is sponsoring it.

Noah: This money is not sponsoring an event, but to feed students
chips. We should be helping new events happen, not funding
extras.
• Alex: Can you further elaborate on the advertising issue?
• Harrison: I’m sorry that was a miscommunication on our part with
NU World Cup on how project pool funding work.
• Evan: Maybe they meant that Harrison and I are working with them
on behalf of ASG.
• Katie: Pro speech.
• Harrison: I think Ani brought up a lot of issues that should be
addressed. As you can see, we are very surprised by the
advertising. Also, this is not haphazard. We have been planning this
out for a while, but there was no Senate last week to bring up.
• Katie: Con speech
• Sofia: I think in terms of fundraising the pool is an outlet and there
are funding outlets on campus that ISA has relations with for you to
go to. There are B-Status whose complete focus is food and that is
the purpose that put in a concerted effort to fundraise even though
their programming is centered around food. This event will happen
regardless and the event is not about food, it is about the World
Cup.
